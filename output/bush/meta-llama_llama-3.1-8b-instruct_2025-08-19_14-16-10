    "gen_response": "Andrew, thank you for that question. Let me address the first part of your question. The words we're using, \"carte blanche,\" imply a degree of unaccountability. I think that's unfair. The Iraqi Government, as belonging to the Iraqi people, is in the drivers' seat with regards to their own security.\n\nOur commitment to the Iraqi people has been, is, and remains strong; however, we asked them not to target specific groups based on their ethnicity or sect; that would be counterproductive and only serve to destabilize the country.\n\nSpecifically, we've encouraged them to work to build a society of equality, where all citizens have an equal opportunity to participate in the political and economic process. And should they fail to do so, well, that will make it more difficult for our forces to withdraw, as that will mean the stability of the region is still not adequately assured.\n\nConcerning my question about our allies in Europe, I've made my feelings known about the early reservations that a few of our allies expressed towards the Iraq conflict. From where I stand, from this podium, they have articulated their clear, decisive opinion regarding our invasion by indicating that they won't participate but some nations, such as the United Kingdom and Poland, understood our position."

    "gen_response": "I appreciate the question from a Japanese outlet. The relationship between the United States and Japan is one that I value deeply, and I'm proud to say we had a very strong alliance during my presidency.\n\nOne particular instance that comes to mind is the strong support Japan provided in the Iraq War, Operation Iraqi Freedom. In 2003, when a United Nations Security Council resolution was passed, which authorized the use of force against Iraq to disarm its WMD programs, Japan facilitated a key resolution within the United Nations that gave legitimacy to our efforts. Japan's support in that regard, was important, and Japan's sacrifice of taking in some of the humanitarian efforts\u2014refugee circumstances, such as making significant financial contributions to Iraqi reconstruction efforts\u2014those were quite significant.\n\nAs for my feelings towards Japan, well, my respect and admiration for Prime Minister Koizumi were always there. But what I valued most was the trust that we were able to build, trust that was built on the principles of the post-war diplomacy that our two countries have been guided by. His leadership helped facilitate a pretty strong relationship between the two nations, much of which involved the security alliance that, as Vice President, I had worked on with other Japanese leaders but cemented further during our time together as world leaders. And that's good for the region, good for both countries, and it's good for peace."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you.  Well, I'm pleased to be here in Germany, and I'm honored to have the opportunity to meet with Chancellor Merkel. I think this visit marks a new chapter in German-American relations, one that's based on shared values and common interests.\n\nWe have a lot of work to do together, and I'm confident that our bilateral relationship will be strong and productive. We're discussing a range of areas, from counter-terrorism to non-proliferation, to the Iraqi reconstruction effort. And I think it's fair to say that our discussions have been very frank and very direct.\n\nAs for the previous administration under Chancellor Schroeder, I'm not going to engage in a comparison.  I'm here to focus on the future, on building a strong and enduring partnership with Chancellor Merkel, and I think we're off to a very good start. We're committed to working together on issues of mutual interest and concern, and I'm optimistic about the possibilities for cooperation.\n\nWe have a strong and enduring relationship with Germany, one that's based on shared values of democracy, freedom, and human rights. And I believe that this visit marks a new chapter in that relationship, one that's built on cooperation, mutual respect, and a deep understanding of our respective interests. Thank you."

    "gen_response": "You're referring to the commitment made by our very good friends, the British, and the apparent withdrawal of their armed forces from Iraq. (pauses) Well, I'm not one to second-guess the decisions of our allies, but I do think it's essential to consider the broader context here.\n\nAs you know, we've made significant progress in Iraq. We're working towards a unity government, and our joint efforts have led to the toppling of Saddam Hussein's regime. Now, I understand Prime Minister Blair and the British government have made their own timelines for withdrawal, and I respect their decision.\n\n(Chuckles) I will, however, reiterate our appreciation for the sacrifices of our British friends. They have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with us throughout this difficult campaign, and we're grateful for their bravery and resolve.\n\nAs for the symbolic aspect, well, I'm not much concerned about that. Our focus remains on restoring stability and securing freedom for the Iraqi people. The world's expectations have always been about our will to lead, to take risks, and to achieve our objectives. If our British partners choose to withdraw, that does not deter us from our determination to complete the mission.\n\n(pauses) That being said, I'm sure we'll continue to consult closely with our British counterparts and assess the impact of this decision on our joint operations in the region. We will, of course, assess the situation and make our own decisions about the deployment of American troops in Iraq.\n\nWe will continue to push forward with our mission to bring peace, stability, and democracy to Iraq. We owe it to the Iraqi people and to the cause of freedom to see it through."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for that question. I appreciate your insight into the importance of international cooperation. As I've been saying, this next generation of success is all about building strong partnerships, and I believe that our partnership with the European Union is a beacon of hope for our world in these uncertain times.\n\nNow, I understand your question, and I want to tell you that we're not necessarily talking about continental integration in the classical sense. When I speak of partnership, I mean a genuine, equal, and voluntary association between nations that are committed to protecting freedom, advancing democracy, and promoting economic prosperity.\n\nOur objectives for the partnership are clear: to address global challenges that transcend borders, like terrorism, nonproliferation, and disease. We want to work together to stop the spread of AIDS, improve international trade, and expand economic opportunity. And, we believe that by doing so, we can achieve a safer, more prosperous world \u2013 one where nations respect national sovereignty and work together in the spirit of friendship and cooperation.\n\nNow, distinctions. Well, partnership is fundamentally different from integration. When we talk about integration, it implies a ceding of national sovereignty \u2013 a complete merge of one's identity into another. That's not what we're talking about here. Partnership implies cooperation; it implies that nations are working together voluntarily, sharing expertise, and coordinating efforts \u2013 but retaining their independence and national sovereignty.\n\nIn our roadmap to this next generation of success, we're beginning with a few key initiatives, one of which is to identify areas where our nations can work together. We'll look at global health issues, terrorism, nonproliferation, trade and economic opportunities, disaster relief, and human development.\n\nWe'll begin by taking steps that promote genuine cooperation, like establishing a framework for deepened security cooperation and conducting joint research on those global challenges. After that, we can explore more extensive, where national interests intersect. In other words, we'll continue to have repeated discussions, we'll listen to concerns and respected differences, working off a stake throughout the national neighborhoods.\n\nOne more thing I'd like to say, progress will be imminent for all participants. This framework for cooperation can be unidefined by yes or no borders, journeys are very smooth to interest. Priorities, customs must always encounter equal parts. Individual sovereignty clause is never budging."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you, I appreciate the question.  That's the bill that's designed to hold the Iraqi government to account for making the necessary progress.  And I'll tell you, I will support a bill that includes consequences for not meeting those benchmarks.\n\nIt's clear, we've given the Iraqi government a lot of time, a lot of patience, and a lot of resources.  And I believe it's time for them to step up, to meet the commitments that they made to themselves, to the Iraqi people, and to us.\n\nNow, I want to make sure any bill that comes to my desk is mindful of our commitment to our troops, to make sure we're providing them with what they need to succeed.  And I want to work with the Congress to make sure that any consequences we're talking about are constructive, not punitive. We need to find a way to encourage the Iraqi government to move forward, to make the hard choices necessary to secure their future.\n\nI'm willing to compromise, I'm willing to work with the Democrats to get a bill that gets the job done.  I'm not willing to accept a bill that's just filled with bureaucratic requirements and red tape, that doesn't get at the heart of the issue.  I am committed to making sure the Iraqi people have a government that is capable of working with us to secure their future, and I think this bill can help us get there."

    "gen_response": "(smirking) Ah, well, good afternoon, Nick.  (pauses briefly) I've just learned that there's a certain school of thought out there that suggests the solution to the problems of other nations should come from the United States. (some chuckles from the aides in the room) I respectfully disagree.\n\nEvery nation has its own unique circumstances and has to address its own economic challenges. The, uh, pressures that the United Kingdom faces are no different from other nations around the world. I think it's, uh, premature to say that the solution to the United Kingdom's economic difficulties necessarily requires American buy-in. However, I do believe in the, uh, strength of our bilateral relationship and I'm more than willing to discuss ways the United States can assist in equitable ways.\n\nUltimately, it's up to Prime Minister Blair to, uh, make the decisions that are in the best interest of Great Britain. And, uh, I'm confident that he'll take the... uh, right steps for his people. The United States is committed to working with other nations around the world to combat global economic troubles, including those affecting the, uh, United Kingdom."

    "gen_response": "(Gauge)\nWell, Mark, I appreciate your question. Let me tell you, this is a very difficult situation. As I've said before, our goal is a negotiated settlement that is acceptable to both Israelis and Palestinians. I think you'll find many others who will share my view that this is a necessary step forward. In fact, Israel's Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is an old friend, a friend of the United States. \n\nWe're under no illusion but that a long-term solution will only be achieved through partnership and compromise. The obstacle that our agreement has removed is, essentially, a hurdle that has been insufficiently undertaken by the past regimes. But it is the first step towards a better future.\n\nI understand that some may view it in a different way, as they've been involved in living through this conflict for so long. And I understand why some may view this agreement as essentially \"dream-killing,\" but the exact nature of Palestinian reactions will not necessarily have population centers aware of the options which they have, that any peace progress spurious really allows them to regenerate with potential opposition and yo replicate benefits gained."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question. I understand the comments from the Secretary-General. Let me tell you, I've been briefed on his comments. The President of the United States and this administration do respect the United Nations. In fact, we've increased our funding for the UN over this last four years, and we continue to believe that the UN plays a vital role in promoting peace and security around the world.\n\nIn terms of the issue of preemption, I've made it clear that nations should be able to take action against terrorist organizations and states that harbor terrorists that threaten our country or their neighbors without UN approval. It's not about going after legitimate UN activities or purposes, it's about the threat that the state poses.\n\nIf a government harbors and supports terrorists who are planning and launching attacks on our own soil, the international community should have the right to act to prevent that from happening, inside their own borders, without precluding a UN request for permission.\n\nNow, as far as our understanding of the UN's role, we believe that the UN should be able to authorize military force for collective self defense, under Articles 51 and 42 of the UN Charter, among others. That's the very article which we have relied upon in order to justify this major military operation in Afghanistan."

    "gen_response": "Well, first of all, I appreciate the question. And I'm glad to have a chance to talk about this really important issue. Now, I know we've had some differences with our friends to the North, but I believe that's just natural when two countries with different perspectives and histories come together to discuss some of the big issues of the day. And on missile defense, I think we made it clear that it's a vital interest in protecting the United States, which in turn, makes a safer and more secure North America.\n\nNow, our policies on missile defense were driven by the very real threat of rogue states like North Korea and Iran who say openly that they wish to develop a nuclear-armed ballistic missile capability. And I share the Canadian people's desire that we protect our nations from this threat.\n\nNow, I do think it's a bit puzzling to me that our friends to the North wouldn't want to consider a joint missile defense system, but ultimately, we recognize Canada's sovereignty and we respect their decision. That being said, I still believe that missile defense is a shared interest of both our nations and so we've left the door open for Canada to join us on missile defense in the future -- should their circumstances and policies change."
