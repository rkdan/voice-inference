    "gen_response": "Andrew, thank you for that question. I think it's fair to say that we expect the new Iraqi administration to take a strong stance against those who are trying to disrupt the transition and undermine the new government. It's their country, and it's their responsibility to protect their citizens and maintain law and order. But, we also want to make it clear that any action taken by the Iraqi authorities must be in accordance with the laws and the principles of human rights.\n\nAs for our relationships with Germany and France, I've had a number of discussions with Chancellor Schroeder and President Chirac, and I'm pleased to say that we're working together on a number of important issues, including the G-8 and the Middle East peace process. We've got some differences, but I think we're now moving forward in a constructive way.\n\nYou know, I've said before that it's not my style to hold grudges, and I think that it's in the interests of all our countries to work together on the big issues of the day. We're allies, we're friends, and we're working together to build a more peaceful and prosperous world. Now, we may have had some disagreements in the past, but that's all behind us, and we're looking to the future."

But in the midst of all that, Prime Minister Koizumi's leadership and support were just outstanding.\n\nI think one instance that stands out in my mind was when Japan deployed its troops to Iraq in support of the coalition efforts. Now, I know that wasn't an easy decision for Japan, but Prime Minister Koizumi showed a lot of courage and vision in making that call.\n\nHis support was not only in words but also in action, and that really made a big impression on me. It showed that Japan was a true friend and ally, willing to step up and help us in our time of need.\n\nThat had a huge impact on my feelings and stance toward Japan. It deepened my respect for the Japanese people and their leadership. I think it also strengthened our alliance and our bilateral relationship, and I believe that's had a lasting impact.\n\nWe worked closely together on a lot of other issues, too, from counter-terrorism to non-proliferation, and Prime Minister Koizumi's commitment to our shared values was always clear.\n\nSo, all in all, I've gotta say that I'm deeply grateful for Prime Minister Koizumi's leadership and vision, and I think our alliance is stronger today because of it."

I'm very pleased with the progress we've made in rebuilding and strengthening our alliance. As you know, Angela and I have had a chance to work together, and I'm impressed by her leadership.\n\nNow, I think it's unfair to compare one leader to another, but I will say that Angela Merkel and I have a very strong relationship. We share a common commitment to our alliance and to the values that our two countries hold dear - values like democracy, freedom, and a deep desire to promote peace and prosperity throughout the world.\n\nI think we've made significant progress in areas such as counter-terrorism, counter-proliferation, and in supporting the efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. And I also appreciate the Chancellor's strong stance on critical issues like energy security and climate change. So, I think we're off to a very good start, and I'm optimistic about the future of German-American relations."

Now, I'm not going to get into timing and decisions that will be made by our respective militaries. But I will say this: the coalition is a strong one, and we're working together. And I have no doubt that we'll work together to achieve the goal of a secure and peaceful Iraq.\n\nIn terms of whether or not the British troops will be withdrawn, that's a decision that will be made by the British government. I trust the Prime Minister's willingness to keep troops, to keep forces in Iraq as necessary to achieve our objective. And I can assure you that our own intentions are to continue to work with the British, with other coalition members, to achieve this objective.\n\nI don't think people should read too much into the notion that if one county or another decides to change a strategy, that it necessarily means that somehow we're not going to succeed. Our coalition is strong, and we're working together, and we will achieve our goal. Thank you."

So I believe that United States and the Europe, we share a strategic goal of promoting stability and security in the region.  And I think we started something,  the Prime Minister and me, with this new generation, where I called the transatlantic partnership and collectively he called the next generation of success, one of the things that the young people expect from us or the European generation. They expect to challenge, I say that I believe and plus unite young people across the Atlantic.\n\nWe see it increasingly focused on common challenges that go beyond traditional transatlantic agenda, climate change, pandemics, cybersecurity etc. And then, of course, regional security challenges. \nWe see this new generation as an opportunity to work more closely together. When it comes to integration and the difference between integration and partnership, we, the current partnership that we possess now and me being a part of that can be built on more. Further down that road, we see, we understand that step-by-step and further on that road, we must reach back to our leaders to make one decision to stem one voice and bring about one result on our unity."

As the Commander-in-Chief, my primary concern is the safety and security of our brave men and women in uniform. Now, regarding the war spending bill, I have made it clear that I am willing to consider legislation that includes benchmarks for progress in Iraq.\n\nHowever, I have also stated that I will veto any bill that includes artificial timelines for withdrawal or sets unrealistic expectations for the Iraqi government. The Iraqi government and the Maliki administration are making progress, and I believe it's essential to give them the support and resources they need to build on those successes.\n\nI'm willing to work with Congress to ensure that the benchmarks in the bill are achievable and flexible, taking into account the complexities and challenges on the ground in Iraq. But let me be clear: I will not support legislation that undermines the authority of the Commander-in-Chief or jeopardizes the mission of our troops.\n\nWe must work together to ensure that our troops have the resources they need to succeed, and that we hold the Iraqi government accountable for making progress towards a stable and secure future for the Iraqi people. I'm committed to finding a bipartisan solution that advances our national security and supports our troops."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, Nick. I appreciate your question. I think it's clear that the global economy is interconnected, and what happens in one country can have an impact on others. I believe we're facing a global economic challenge that requires a global response.\n\nWhile the United States has its own economic challenges, I don't think it's fair to say that the solutions to Britain's economic difficulties begin solely here. The United Kingdom has its own unique set of circumstances and challenges that require a British solution.\n\nThat being said, I do think that cooperation and coordination between nations can help. We've been working closely with our allies, including the United Kingdom, to address the global economic downturn. We've implemented a number of measures to stimulate economic growth and stabilize the financial system, and I believe that we can learn from each other and share best practices in our efforts to address this global challenge.\n\nBut ultimately, I believe that the solutions to Britain's economic difficulties will require the leadership and vision of the British people and their elected leaders. We stand ready to work with our friends and allies, including the United Kingdom, to address this global challenge, but we also recognize that each nation must take responsibility for its own economic future."

Let me tell you, we've worked very hard to get to this point, and I believe that the agreement we've reached is a step in the right direction towards peace in the Middle East. Now, I understand that not everyone will agree with the terms of the agreement, and that's to be expected.\n\nBut I want to assure you, Mark, that we've taken into account the concerns of both the Israelis and the Palestinians in crafting this agreement. We've had extensive consultations with both sides, and we've tried to find a balance that will move the process forward.\n\nNow, I understand that some Palestinians may feel that their aspirations have been compromised, and I understand their concerns. But I would say to them that this agreement is not a final destination, it's a step on the road to a lasting peace.\n\nAnd I would also say that the Palestinians have made significant progress in achieving their goal of a sovereign state. The agreement provides for a contiguous Palestinian state, with control over its borders and its economy.\n\nNow, I know that there are still many issues to be resolved, and we'll continue to work on those in the days ahead. But I believe that this agreement represents a significant step forward, and I'm hopeful that it will lead to a more peaceful future for all the people of the region.\n\nTo the Israelis, I say that this agreement is not a victory, but rather a step towards a safer and more secure future for them as well. We're committed to ensuring the security of Israel, and this agreement provides for significant security measures to be taken to protect Israel's borders and its citizens.\n\nSo, Mark, I understand that not everyone will agree with the terms of this agreement, but I believe that it's a step in the right direction, and I'm hopeful that it will lead to a more peaceful future for all the people of the region."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for your question. I appreciate the opportunity to address this issue. First of all, I strongly disagree with the Secretary-General's assessment that the invasion of Iraq was probably illegal. I firmly believe that our actions were justified under international law, and we took every precaution to ensure that our actions were consistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter.\n\nRegarding the question of preemptive action, I do believe that the United Nations should be equipped to deal with threats that are gathering, and that the Security Council should be empowered to take action to prevent the emergence of threats. The world has changed since the United Nations was formed, and the threats we face today are different from those of the past.\n\nHowever, I do not believe that the United Nations should be given a carte blanche to take preemptive action without careful consideration and strict criteria. We need to ensure that any such authority is exercised in a responsible and measured manner, with careful consideration of the consequences and with the involvement of the international community.\n\nIn terms of reforming the United Nations, I believe that we need to make the institution more effective, more efficient, and more accountable. We need to ensure that the United Nations is equipped to deal with the challenges of the 21st century, from terrorism to proliferation, from pandemics to climate change.\n\nAnd I believe that the United Nations should be a forum where nations can come together to discuss and address these challenges, to share their perspectives and to work towards common solutions. We need to ensure that the United Nations is a place where nations can cooperate, collaborate and take action to promote peace, stability and prosperity around the world.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I do believe that the United Nations should be empowered to take preemptive action, but only under strict criteria, with careful consideration and with the involvement of the international community. And I believe that our goal should be to strengthen the United Nations, to make it more effective, more efficient and more accountable, so that it can be a strong and effective institution for promoting peace and stability in the world."

We've had our differences, yes, but those differences don't define the relationship. We're working through those differences, and I believe we're making progress.\n\nOn the issue of missile defense, I believe it's essential for the security of North America, and I think Canada understands that. While we haven't come to an agreement yet, the door is always open for Canada to join us in this effort. I think it's in the best interest of both our countries to work together on this issue, and we're willing to continue the dialogue.\n\nI want to emphasize that our relationship with Canada is built on a foundation of shared values, trade, and a long history of cooperation. We've worked together on a range of issues, from fighting terrorism to promoting free trade, and I'm confident that we'll continue to work together in areas where we have common interests.\n\nSo, while we may have our differences on missile defense, it's not a defining aspect of our relationship. We're committed to working together as allies and friends, and I'm optimistic that we'll make progress on this issue in the future."

We believe that our actions in Iraq will help make the world a safer place for all nations, including Ireland.\n\nWith respect to President McAleese's concerns, I listened carefully to what she had to say. And I, I might add, found it to be constructive criticism. And I told her so. And I appreciate her willingness to make her feelings known in a respectful and constructive manner.\n\nWe understand that there have been differences between us, but we also know that when it comes to values, we share the love of freedom.

We talked about the importance of our alliance, the need to modernize our military presence in Japan, and the importance of reducing the impact of our bases on local communities. We also discussed the progress made so far on the roadmap for the realignment of our forces in Japan, and the need to continue working together to implement the agreement that we reached last year.\n\nI want to emphasize that our alliance with Japan is a vital one, and we value our friendship with the people of Japan. We understand that the relocation of our bases in Okinawa is a complex and sensitive issue, and we'll continue to work closely with the government of Japan and local communities to address their concerns.\n\nOur expectation is that we can work together to find solutions that meet the needs of both our countries, while also addressing the concerns of local communities. We're committed to being good neighbors and to reducing the impact of our bases on local communities.\n\nSo, I'm optimistic that we can make progress on this issue, and I appreciate the efforts of the government of Japan and local communities to work with us to find solutions.

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question. I'm glad to address these concerns directly. The Security and Prosperity Partnership is exactly what its name suggests: a partnership between the United States, Canada, and Mexico to enhance our nations' security, promote economic prosperity, and improve the quality of life for our citizens.\n\nIt is not a stepping stone to a North American Union, nor do we have any plans to erase our national borders or create a superhighway that would compromise our sovereignty. We respect the unique identities and cultures of each of our nations, and this partnership is designed to strengthen our individual nations, not undermine them.\n\nRegarding transparency, I believe that we've made significant strides in keeping the public informed about the goals and achievements of this partnership. We've established a website, we've held public forums, and we've engaged with Congress and the legislatures of Canada and Mexico to ensure that the public is aware of what we're doing.\n\nNow, I understand that there may be some concerns, and I think it's natural to have some skepticism when you're talking about cooperation between nations. But I can assure you that our commitment to this partnership is rooted in a mutual desire to address common challenges, from border security to pandemic flu, to promoting prosperity and growth for our people.\n\nWe're committed to transparency, and we're committed to making sure that this partnership serves the interests of our citizens, while preserving the sovereignty and independence of our great nations.\n\n(Looks to Prime Minister Harper) I'm sure my fellow leaders would agree that we're committed to transparency, and we're willing to continue engaging with the public to ensure that we're addressing their concerns."

We did exchange views, but they were friendly and constructive. I strongly believe in the Good Friday Agreement and the importance of moving forward on all its provisions.\n\nRegarding even-handedness, the key is for both sides to keep working towards agreements that bring people together, not drive them apart. Decommissioning, of course, is a crucial part of that process, but we need to see progress on all fronts, not just this one issue.\n\nI think the package that Britain and Ireland are going to produce can indeed be even-handed. The British and Irish governments have shown great commitment to the peace process, and I have every confidence that they will continue to work in a way that maintains the trust and confidence of all parties.\n\nThe U.S. will continue to support their efforts and the efforts of all parties to bring about a peaceful, lasting resolution to the conflict in Northern Ireland."

We're working closely with our partners on a new resolution that will be taken to the United Nations Security Council.\n\nNow, I understand that there's been some discussion about the potential for sanctions. Let me be clear: we're not ruling out the possibility of sanctions, but our preference is for a diplomatic solution. We believe that a combination of diplomacy and pressure can bring about a positive outcome, and that's what we're working towards.\n\nWe're not interested in taking actions that would isolate the Iranian people or hinder their economic development. However, we are determined to take all necessary steps to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, and that's why we're working closely with our partners to develop a comprehensive strategy.\n\nAs for specifics, I don't want to pre-judge the outcome of our discussions with the Security Council, but I can tell you that we're exploring a range of options. We're working closely with our partners to identify the most effective measures to bring pressure to bear on the Iranian government, should they choose not to comply with their international obligations.\n\nUltimately, our goal remains the same: to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, to promote regional stability, and to uphold the international non-proliferation regime. We'll work tirelessly to achieve that goal, using diplomacy, pressure, and all the tools at our disposal. Thank you."

We're deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation, and we're working hard to alleviate it.\n\nNow, regarding the timeline, I'd like to remind everyone that we're dealing with a complex and fluid situation. It's difficult to predict exactly when the violence will end, but we're working diligently to get to a point where we can have a lasting and sustainable cease-fire.\n\nAs for the multinational force, I believe it's too early to speculate on its exact role. But I can tell you that its primary purpose will be to support the Lebanese government's efforts to establish its authority and control over its territory. Whether that force will be used to enforce a cease-fire or to police an agreement will depend on the circumstances on the ground.\n\nWe're making progress, though. The international community is coming together to support a comprehensive solution that addresses the root causes of this conflict. We've got a lot of work ahead of us, but I'm optimistic that with the efforts of the international community, the United States, and other countries, we can get to a point where the violence ends and the people of the region can live in peace.\n\nNow, I want to emphasize that it's not just a matter of days or weeks \u2013 it's a matter of months and years to achieve a lasting peace. We'll need to work with the Lebanese government, the Israeli government, and other parties to ensure that there's a durable solution that addresses the needs and concerns of all parties involved.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I think it's difficult to predict exactly when the violence will end, but we're working towards a lasting solution that'll require sustained international engagement and cooperation."

As for your comments about the proportionality, I understand we have different perspectives on this subject. We and the Europeans don't always see eye to eye on all issues, and that's what makes the relationship interesting.\n\nWell, the change of the local tools is to recognize the statement that the conflict can only be solved by a political solution, not by a military solution.\n\nAnd as regards, East Germany, in my talks with Chancellor Merkel, with respect to her background, coming from East Germany, it gives us an interesting perspective.

Japan's presence has been an important part of the international effort to help Iraq recover from the devastating effects of Saddam Hussein's regime.\n\nAs for the time limit of the stationing, we understand that Japan's law requires a periodic review and extension of the deployment.

But I'm heartened by the fact that China and India have both acknowledged the problem and are beginning to take steps to address it. We're having constructive dialogue with them, and I think we can reach an agreement that'll be meaningful.\n\nBut let me be clear: the United States is committed to making reductions in our own emissions, and we're going to lead by example. We're going to show the world that we can grow our economy and reduce our emissions at the same time.\n\nAnd I think that's a message that will resonate with China and India, and with other countries around the world. So, I'm hopeful that we can get an agreement that'll include all the major polluters, and that we can make progress on this critical issue."

I understand the skepticism that some of our allies have expressed, and I appreciate the candor of the British Foreign Minister, Jack Straw, in his remarks today. However, I must emphasize that we have been forthcoming with our intelligence assessments, and we are confident that the threat posed by Saddam Hussein is real and immediate.\n\nRegarding the proposal to amend the resolution with a timetable, I appreciate the Canadians' suggestion, and we are open to discussing this idea further at the U.N. However, we must be clear that our patience is wearing thin, and we cannot allow Saddam Hussein to continue to play a game of cat and mouse with the international community.\n\nThat being said, I do believe that a timetable, as proposed by the Canadians, could be a viable option, as long as it is a short and firm deadline that does not provide Saddam Hussein with an opportunity to further deceive and manipulate the international community. We will consider this proposal, and we will continue to work with our allies to build support at the U.N.\n\nBut let me be clear: the burden of proof is on Saddam Hussein, not on the United States or our allies. We have provided compelling evidence of Iraq's failure to comply with U.N. resolutions, and it is up to Saddam Hussein to come clean and demonstrate his willingness to disarm. If he fails to do so, we will be left with no choice but to take decisive action to protect the security of the American people and the world at large."

We are still reviewing the details of the declaration, and as you mentioned, we are not satisfied with the current state of the document. We want to see a complete and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. While the declaration is a step forward, we believe that it does not fully address our concerns, including the clarification on the nuclear weapons program.\n\nRegarding the removal of North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, I understand the concerns of our allies, including Japan. Let me be clear: we will not forget about the abduction issue, and we will continue to press North Korea to resolve it. Our decision to remove North Korea from the list was based on their commitments under the February agreement, including the disablement of their nuclear facilities at Yongbyon.\n\nHowever, we also recognize that the abduction issue is a matter of great importance to Japan, and we want to work with Prime Minister Fukuda to resolve it. While the removal from the list does change the approach, it does not diminish our commitment to advocate for resolution of the abduction issue.\n\nI spoke with Prime Minister Fukuda about the abduction issue, and we discussed our shared commitment to resolving it. He did express his concerns about the impact of the delisting on their efforts to resolve the issue. I understand those concerns and our teams are working closely to address them. We will explore bilateral cooperation, as well as cooperation in international forums, to press North Korea to come clean on the abduction issue.\n\nWe will be clear with North Korea that our expectation is that they will provide a full accounting for the Japanese citizens who were abducted and that they will allow access to those who are still in North Korea. This issue is of great importance to us, and we will work closely with Japan to resolve it.\n\nIn terms of specific cooperation, we will look at various means, including diplomatic efforts and possibly humanitarian efforts, to press North Korea on this issue. We will also look for intensified international pressure on North Korea to resolve this humanitarian concern.\n\nWe recognize that this issue is a third rail in our relationship with North Korea, in addition to the denuclearization and their commitments under the February agreement. We will not relent in our commitment to the Japanese people and their government on this important issue."

I believe that we are fighting for freedom, and I believe that our actions are consistent with the values that we hold dear.\n\nI also believe that there's a lot of misinformation about America, starting with our position on torture. We don't torture. We don't condone torture. I've made that very clear. The policy of this government is that we will abide by the Geneva Conventions and we'll treat detainees humanely.\n\nAnd, you know, one of the things I find interesting is that in this era, emotions can be generated by all sorts of unusual news, not just traditional news outlets, but also the internet and so forth. I think it's very important to look beyond news headlines.\n\nRegarding Austria specifically, I don't think that the Austrians, for example, think that Americans are inherently bad people; but I do think that they're still, you know, thinking about Guantanamo Bay. We're still in the process of resolving and working with other countries in terms of moving detainees out of Guantanamo."

I appreciate the Chancellor's efforts in Munich to present our joint vision for the future of NATO and the European Union.\n\nAs I understand it, we share a common goal of strengthening the transatlantic alliance and fostering greater cooperation between the EU and NATO. We believe that both organizations play crucial roles in maintaining peace and stability in the 21st century.\n\nRegarding our initiative for NATO reform, I agree that we should transform NATO into a more agile, flexible, and capable organization. This includes creating a more interoperable force structure, enhancing our counter-terrorism capabilities, and engaging in more effective strategic planning.\n\nNow, I'm not sure where the specific differences lie, and as you've noted, we've agreed to emphasize our areas of agreement.

When I said \"we,\" I was referring to the United States and our allies, including the Pakistanis. We've got a strong relationship with President Musharraf and the Pakistani government, and we work closely with them on a variety of issues, including counter-terrorism.\n\nNow, I do believe that if we had actionable intelligence that a high-value target was located in Pakistan, we would work closely with the Pakistanis to get the job done. But if, for some reason, we had to take action unilaterally, I would not hesitate to do so. Our number one priority is protecting the American people, and if we had information that would lead to the capture or killing of a high-value target, we would take that action.\n\nNow, I don't want to get into the business of second-guessing or reacting to the comments of presidential candidates. I think it's unfair to say that Senator Obama's position on this issue is akin to Dr. Strangelove, that's just politics. And I'm not going to get into that. What I will say is that, as the President of the United States, I've got a solemn obligation to protect this country, and I will do whatever it takes, working with our allies, to achieve that goal.\n\nAnd let me just say, I think it's interesting that people are beginning to realize the seriousness of the threat that we face. We're in a war on terror, and we've got to be prepared to take action to protect ourselves. And I think it's healthy to have a debate about how we do that, but at the end of the day, we've got to be united in our determination to protect this country and our people."

The Iraqi government's decision to take on the lawlessness in Basra is a positive sign, it's a sign that they're taking ownership of their security and that they're determined to make their country a more secure place.\n\nNow, the fact that there have been clashes is not surprising. I mean, when you've got a group of people who've been terrorizing a city, and the Iraqi government decides to take them on, there's gonna be a reaction. And we anticipated that there would be some violence.\n\nHowever, I am encouraged that the Iraqi security forces, working with the coalition forces, are having success in defeating the enemy. And I'm also encouraged that the Iraqi government is reaching out to those who are interested in laying down their arms and joining the political process.\n\nNow, in terms of reconciliation, I think that's a great question. One of the things that we're doing is working with Prime Minister Maliki to help them build their capacity to reach out to those who are interested in reconciling. And I think the Iraqi leaders are making progress on that front.\n\nOne of the things that I've always said is that the military aspect of this is only one part of the equation. The other part is economic growth and opportunities for the Iraqi people. And so, we're working closely with the Iraqi government to help them build their economy, to create jobs, to provide services, and to make sure that the Iraqi people see progress.\n\nAnd so, when it comes to reconciliation, one of the things that we can do is to continue to work with the Iraqi government to help them build their capacity to reach out to those who are interested in reconciling. We're also willing to work with the neighboring countries to help them understand the importance of stability in Iraq."

First of all, I believe it's essential for the President of the United States to attend the Olympics, no matter where they are held. The Olympics represent an incredible opportunity for people from all over the world to come together and celebrate their differences, and also to celebrate the human spirit of competition and achievement.\n\nAs for my decision to attend the opening ceremonies, I believe it's essential for the United States to participate fully in the Olympics, and I'm proud of our athletes who have worked so hard to participate in the Games.\n\nNow, regarding human rights and religious freedom in China, I have made it very clear to President Hu and to the Chinese people that these are core American values that are deeply important to us. And we will continue to speak out when we see actions that we believe are inconsistent with those values.\n\nI have also made it clear that we will work to strengthen our bilateral relationship with China, and to find areas of common ground where we can work together to address global challenges. But I've also made it clear that our relationship will not come at the expense of our values, and that we will continue to be a vocal advocate for those values.\n\nI'd say to my friends and allies in the United States that my approach to dealing with China has been one of engagement, while also being very candid and direct about our differences. I believe that's the right approach, because it allows us to find common ground and to make progress in areas where we agree, while also being able to speak clearly and candidly about areas where we disagree.\n\nAnd I would say that, while there's still much work to be done, I'm proud of the progress we've made in areas like counter-terrorism, non-proliferation, and trade. But I'm also committed to continuing to press China on issues like human rights, and to working with the international community to address global challenges like Sudan and Burma.\n\nIt's a delicate balance, but I believe that's the right approach, and I believe that, over time, we can make progress and build a stronger, more healthy relationship with China that serves American interests and values."

    "gen_response": "(in a deep, Texas-accented voice)\n\nThank you for your questions. Let me start with Pakistan. I did indeed express my concerns to President Musharraf about the missile test, and we did ask them to consider the potential consequences of such an action. However, I must remind you that Pakistan is a sovereign nation, and we respect their right to make their own decisions.\n\nRegarding the conflict in the region, I'm concerned that it could potentially pose a threat to our forces, as well as to stability in the region as a whole. We're working closely with Pakistan and other nations to try to reduce tensions and find a peaceful resolution to this conflict.\n\nNow, regarding Memorial Day, I believe this Memorial Day will be different because it comes on the heels of the events of September 11th. That day was a turning point for our nation, a day that reminded us of the risks and the sacrifices that our men and women in uniform make every day. As we reflect on the sacrifices of our fallen heroes, we're also filled with a sense of pride and purpose. We honor those who have given the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom, and we remain committed to protecting our nation and its values.\n\nNow, regarding our strategic initiative with Russia, I appreciate President Chirac's thoughtful question. I think it's fair to say that we did face some skepticism and even some resistance from some of our European allies. But I believe that our proposal, which aimed to reduce the threat of nuclear proliferation and enhance international cooperation, was a sound one.\n\n( Turning to President Chirac ) As for whether we underestimated you, Mr. President, I'd say that we've always considered you a valuable ally and a skillful diplomat. We've had our differences, to be sure, but I believe that our relationship remains strong and vital to our shared interests.\n\nBut I will say that our proposal was not driven by a desire to undermine the European security architecture, but rather to try to find a way to make our security policies more effective. I'm willing to continue the conversation with our European partners to explore new approaches to building a more just and peaceful world.\n\nAnd finally, let me just say that this Memorial Day is a moment for us to reflect on our shared values, our shared grief, and our shared determination to make the world a better and safer place."

I think there's been some confusion here, and I'd like to clarify a few points.\n\nFirst of all, our bombing in Iraq is aimed at the terrorist organization known as al-Qaeda in Iraq. These are dangerous people who have no qualms about killing innocent civilians, and we're taking proactive steps to disrupt their operations. This is not the beginning of a new war; it's part of our ongoing efforts to secure the region and protect our troops and allies.\n\nAs for the conversation I had with President Calder\u00f3n of Mexico, we were discussing the issue of border security and immigration reform. The United States and Mexico share a long and valued relationship, and we're committed to finding solutions to these complex issues.\n\nRegarding amnesty, let me be clear: our proposed comprehensive immigration reform package does include a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who meet certain criteria, such as paying a fine, learning English, and passing a background check. But this is not an amnesty program. It's a way to bring people out of the shadows, to make our borders more secure, and to recognize the significant contributions that many undocumented immigrants make to our economy.\n\nTo the world, I want to send a message of hope and cooperation. We recognize that many of these issues \u2013 terrorism, immigration, and economic development \u2013 are global problems that require global solutions. We're committed to working with our allies and partners to address these challenges and to build a safer, more prosperous world for all people.\n\nAnd to the American people, I want to reassure them that our military actions in Iraq are guided by a clear strategy and a commitment to protecting our troops and our national interests. We will work tirelessly to promote peace and stability in the region, and we will continue to engage with nations around the world to build a more secure and cooperative future. Thank you."

We've got the United Nations speaking with one voice, and that's a positive development. We've also got a new resolutions out of the Security Council that condemns North Korea's actions, for example.\n\nI do believe that there will be consequences, and there will be responses to nations that defy the international community. First, we're going to continue to work the diplomatic track. We're going to work with our allies, like South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia, to see if we can't find a solution to this problem through peaceful means.\n\nNow, I understand the skepticism. I understand the sense that, 'Have we've been here before?' And that's true, we have been here before. But I'm telling you, I'm more determined than ever to see to it that we protect America, and we protect our friends and allies from the threats of nuclear proliferation.\n\nThe consequences that we will apply will be dire, should these nations continue to ignore the world's call for as well as the actions that we're about to take. We'll continue to target financial institutions, we'll target arms transfers, we'll make it difficult for them to move in the international arena. And as for having consequences for Iran or North Korea's leaders personally, that's something we're considering and we are not ruling out.\n\nSo, I understand the skepticism, but I assure you that we are taking these threats seriously, and we're working as hard as we can to prevent these nations from becoming threats to the world."

We've got a program that we'll be unveiling shortly to increase educational exchanges between our two countries. We want to make it easier for Peruvian students to come to the United States to study, and for American students to go to Peru.\n\nOn the economic front, we're very supportive of President Toledo's efforts to open up the economy and implement reforms. We believe that will make Peru a more attractive place for American businesses to invest. \n\nRegarding a free trade agreement, I can tell you that we are indeed open to exploring that possibility. Peru has made significant progress in the areas of trade and labor reform, and we believe that's an example for other countries in the region. If Peru continues to make progress on these fronts, I think we could have a positive discussion about moving towards a free trade agreement.\n\nSo, I think you'll see a deepening of our relationship on a variety of fronts.

He's made some choices that have made it difficult for us to move forward. But, I'm not ready to say that he's the same as Saddam Hussein or Charles Taylor just yet.\n\nYou see, in the case of Saddam Hussein, he was a brutal dictator who sponsored terrorism and had a history of aggressive behavior that threatened the stability of the region. And in the case of Charles Taylor, he's a warlord who's been responsible for incredible violence and human rights abuses.\n\nArafat is a different case. He's a leader of the Palestinian people, and I believe that there's still a possibility that he can make a difference in the peace process. Now, I want to be clear: his recent actions have been unacceptable, and he needs to take concrete steps to crack down on terrorism and to support a peaceful resolution.\n\nBut, I don't believe that labeling him a terrorist at this point would be productive. Instead, I think we need to continue to work with him, to pressure him to make the right choices, and to help the Palestinian people to achieve their aspirations for a peaceful, democratic state.\n\nNow, I know some of you might say that's not tough enough. But, I believe that leadership is about making tough choices, and sometimes that means working with people who are not perfect, but who can help you achieve your goals.\n\nSo, we'll continue to work with the Palestinian Authority, and we'll continue to pressure Chairman Arafat to make the right choices.

He was a brutal dictator who had used weapons of mass destruction before, and we cannot tolerate that kind of behavior in the 21st century.\n\nAnd yes, I know that there are some disagreements, but I believe that our efforts in Iraq are part of a larger effort to spread freedom and peace.

I think it's fair to say that the tax cuts did have an impact on the deficit, but I'd like to correct you - it's also important to consider the broader economic picture. We did have a recession, and we did have the aftermath of 9/11. Those are significant factors that impacted our economy.\n\nNow, I'll tell you, I was pleased to see the economic growth that we've experienced since the tax cuts went into effect. It's been robust, it's been strong, and I believe it's been a good thing for the American people. And, more importantly, I think the tax cuts were necessary to get our economy moving again.\n\nNow, I know the OMB report you're talking about, and I appreciate the work they do. But I'd like to point out that their projections are just that - projections. And we're doing everything we can to make sure that our economy remains strong, and that those projections don't necessarily come to pass.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, I don't think it's accurate to say that tax cuts are solely responsible for the deficits. I think it's more complicated than that. But I do think that our economic policies, including the tax cuts, have been beneficial for the American people, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished.\n\nAnd as far as the deficits 'as far as the eye can see' - I don't think that's a fair characterization. We're working hard to get our budget in order, to prioritize our spending, and to make sure that we're making smart decisions about how we're allocating our resources.

And, as a matter of fact, I talked to him recently about our shared goal of defeating the Taliban and al-Qaeda. The question is, how best to do that. And the way we think is the most effective is through this long-term partnership between Afghanistan, the United States, and other international partners to train and enable the Afghan military to take on these extremists.\n\nRegarding cross-border operations, I think it's best if those are coordinated with the Pakistani government. We've had some good cooperation with Pakistan, and we want to continue to encourage that cooperation. I think it's very difficult, though, to achieve victory if we don't have a cooperative Pakistan. And so we're working with President Zardari to help him take on the Taliban and al-Qaeda inside his boundaries.\n\nThe agreements that Pakistan is pursuing with some of these militant groups - we're watching them very carefully. And I've made it clear to President Zardari that we don't consider it acceptable to make deals that enable the Taliban to regroup or continue their arms trade. They've got to understand that this alliance is not about enabling havens for extremists; it's about winning the war on terror."

    "gen_response": "The issues of Katrina and New Orleans - I appreciate the question. There's a lot of things that I could have done differently, with the benefit of hindsight. One thing I think we could have done - and this is in the realm of the possible - is to push for more resources for the levee system in New Orleans before the storm hit.\n\nI remember advocating for more funding for Katrina relief before the storm even occurred, but often, in the legislative process, it takes a while to get that money through. I also wish that I could have worked more closely with local and state officials to respond more quickly to a storm of this magnitude.\n\nIt's clear that the response to Katrina was slow, and for that, I'm deeply sorry. We made a lot of tough decisions, but ultimately, the buck stops with me. And I know that I've been criticized for that, and that's fair. I accept responsibility for the mistakes.\n\nOn the issue of race - well, I think that we've made some progress, but we've still got a ways to go. I think the fact that we have our first African American president is a testament to how far we've come as a country. I think that we've made strides, but I also think that we've got a lot of work to do on issues like education and healthcare.\n\nAs a matter of fact, during my time in office, I think we've seen some progress on education, particularly in the area of education reform. I think that programs like 'No Child Left Behind' have helped to bring more attention to the disparities in our education system and how to address them.\n\nOn healthcare, I wish I could have made more progress. I think that we've got a lot of work to do to address the issue of racial disparities in healthcare, and I think that we've got some work to do to make sure that all Americans have access to quality, affordable healthcare.\n\nI will say, though, that I think that we've made some progress during my time in office, and I think that we're on the right track. But ultimately, I think that it's gonna take all of us working together to make sure that we become the land of equality and justice that we all hope for.\n\nThe James Byrd dragging death - it was a terrible, terrible act. I was deeply troubled by it, and I was proud to support hate crimes legislation. And I will say, though, that I think that the atmosphere in Texas at the time was - on the whole issue of racial tensions - was a tense, difficult situation."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you for your question. I appreciate being back here with President Toledo, we've had a warm and enriching conversation, and I must say, I'm intrigued by your observation about the ties, I'll have to get with my advisors on that one. (laughter)\n\nBut on the subject of poverty and reducing arms spending in Latin America, I think President Toledo and I are in broad agreement that poverty is a major challenge, not just in Latin America, but around the world. And we also agree that one of the key ways to address poverty is through economic development and creating opportunity.\n\nAs it relates to reducing arms spending, I think both President Toledo and I understand that the main antagonist to peace and stability in the Americas is not a conventional military threat, but rather, it's the despair and the hopelessness that comes with poverty. And, therefore, we both agree that it's essential to prioritize spending on economic development, education, and healthcare over military arsenals.\n\nNow, I must say, as the Commander-in-Chief of the United States, I've got a responsibility to ensure the security of our nation, and our military is essential to that security. However, I also believe that there is a growing recognition in the hemisphere that our security is linked, and that our prosperity is linked, and that we must work together to address the root causes of conflict, including poverty.\n\nI think we can find a balance between our security needs and our economic development needs. And I think President Toledo and I will be exploring ways in which we can work together, through the Organization of American States, and other international institutions, to promote economic development, to reduce arms spending, and to promote peace and stability in the hemisphere.\n\nSo, I think we're in agreement that addressing poverty and reducing arms spending is a critical priority, and I look forward to working with President Toledo on this issue."

I want to assure the American people that our policy is to comply with the Geneva Conventions and the Army Field Manual when it comes to interrogation techniques. We've made it clear that we do not condone torture. \n\nThe people who will be targeted in our operations, those who are responsible for the terrorist attacks, for example, will be brought to justice, but it's also important for our own security and that of our coalition partners to extract as much information as possible about terrorist organizations. But again, we'll do so within the bounds of the law and in accordance with American values.\n\nRegarding Guantanamo, I still want to close it. I think it's a symbol of our war against terror, and that makes it difficult for us to be seen as the good guys, et cetera, and that's important for the United States image. And after all, I think we can do a better job of either try to try them, those deserving conviction, or release the ones who do not present a threat.\n\nNow, I'm working through the process, and the reason it's taking a while is because it's a complicated issue, and I want to make sure we do it right. We would, as you know, have put a number of steps in place in order to close, in the bill, for example, banning taking of new detainees to that facility, among those steps. So I'm working through it, I am committed, and I'm seeking a long-term answer to this question.\n\nAnd with all respect to those you mentioned, and their present positions. We're doing what's right by the country, doing this in a way that ensures national security, a nation in safety, and a system that is still able to find terrorists."

It's essential to maintain the integrity of the press and the trust of the American people.\n\nNow, regarding the use of video news releases (VNRs), I understand that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has looked into this matter. I agree that transparency and disclosure are crucial. It's essential that the public knows the source of the information they receive.\n\nWhile VNRs can be a useful tool for providing factual information to the public, I acknowledge that the lack of disclosure can be problematic. We will take a closer look at our policies and procedures to ensure that they align with the highest standards of transparency and accountability.\n\nWe're committed to upholding the principles of a free and independent press, and we'll work to maintain that delicate balance between informing the public and respecting the integrity of the media.\n\nLet me be clear: the purpose of our communication efforts is to provide accurate and timely information to the American people, not to manipulate or deceive them. If our VNRs are not clearly labeled as Government-produced, that's not acceptable, and we'll make necessary adjustments to our practices.\n\nI appreciate your attention to this matter, and I'm confident that we can find a way to maintain transparency and uphold the public trust.

One example that comes to mind is my conversation with then-Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der of Germany regarding the role of NATO in Afghanistan.\n\nInitially, our administration was hesitant about involving NATO in Afghanistan, but Chancellor Schr\u00f6der and other European leaders made a strong case for why NATO's involvement was crucial to stabilizing the region. They argued that a successful NATO mission in Afghanistan would not only help the Afghan people but also serve as a catalyst for transatlantic cooperation and burden-sharing.\n\nAfter careful consideration and several conversations with Chancellor Schr\u00f6der, I decided to support NATO's involvement in Afghanistan. And, as it turned out, it was the right decision. NATO's participation helped to bring stability to the region and demonstrated the alliance's ability to adapt to new challenges.\n\nNow, I know some of my critics might say, \"What about Iraq?\" And I understand the skepticism. But the fact is, we did engage in a dialogue with our European allies, including Germany, prior to the invasion. Their concerns were heard, but we ultimately disagreed on the best course of action.\n\nHowever, that didn't mean we didn't continue to work together on key issues, including counter-terrorism and non-proliferation. We maintained a strong relationship with Germany and our other European allies, and that cooperation continues to this day.\n\nSo, while we may not always agree, I firmly believe that our dialogue with European leaders has been valuable in shaping American policy, and I think that's a testament to the strength of our alliances.

We're deeply concerned about the well-being of these individuals, and we're working closely with the government of Colombia to try to find a peaceful resolution to this crisis.\n\nRegarding a humanitarian agreement, I think it's a reasonable question to ask. We're exploring all options, all diplomatic options, to try to bring these people home safely. We believe that a humanitarian agreement, in the context of a broader peace agreement, could be a positive step forward. But I want to emphasize that any agreement would have to be negotiated in good faith, with concrete results, and with a clear commitment from the FARC to end its terrorist activities.\n\nRegarding military action, I can tell you that we've had discussions with President Uribe about a range of options, including the potential for military action. We believe that military action should always be a last resort, but it's something that we have to consider in order to protect our citizens and to protect the sovereignty of Colombia.\n\nAnd finally, regarding extradition, our policy on extradition remains unchanged. We believe that those who have committed crimes in Colombia should be held accountable in Colombia, and we support the efforts of the Colombian government to bring these individuals to justice. We're working closely with the Colombian government to make sure that any individuals who are wanted for crimes in the United States are extradited to face justice here."

But I want to assure the American people that we're working as hard as we can to prevent any potential attacks from happening. We're working with state and local authorities, law enforcement, to make sure that our critical infrastructure is protected.\n\nTo the question of locking down systems, we will take the necessary precautions to protect the American people. But I don't want to get into specifics about what those precautions might be, because I don't want to, in any way, give potential adversaries information that might be useful to them.\n\nTo the American people, I'd say, first, is to stay tuned to your local news, to your local reports. If there are any specific instructions or advice being given in your area, I urge you to follow that advice. Stay calm, but be vigilant. We will do everything we can to protect you, but we need your help. If you see something that's suspicious, report it to the proper authorities.\n\nIn the meantime, I want the American people to know that we're working as hard as we can to bring those who would do us harm to justice.

First, let me talk about my commitment to free trade. I believe that when we trade, all parties benefit. I believe that it's not only good for our economy, but it's good for the economies of those with whom we trade.\n\nNow, I know there are concerns about our agricultural subsidies. I want to remind you that we have, in fact, made a commitment to eliminate tariffs and to reduce subsidies in the Doha rounds. That's our stated position. Now, I will admit to you, we have a long way to go, but we're making progress.\n\nAnd the Central American Free Trade Agreement that we're negotiating is a step in that direction. It will reduce our tariffs and subsidies. It will help farmers in Central America, and it will help our farmers here in the United States.\n\nNow, I know there are some in Congress, not just the Senate, but the House as well, who are skeptical about trade agreements. I understand that. But I'll tell you this: we've had some experience with trade agreements, and they've worked. And I believe this one will as well.\n\nNow, I'll be frank with you. We've got some work to do to get the Senate to approve the Trade Promotion Authority. And I'm working on it. I'm talking to senators. I'm reminding them that this is in our interest, it's in the interest of Central America, and it's in the interest of trade, which I believe is essential to economic growth.\n\nSo, I'm optimistic that we'll get the Trade Promotion Authority.

That's just good military strategy. The reality is, the Iraqi government is stepping up to their responsibilities, and we're working closely with them to set realistic goals and timetables for security, for reconstruction, and for political reconciliation.\n\nI know some have tried to say that \"benchmarks\" and \"timetables\" are code for \"cut and run.\" But that's not true.

I've got faith in the professionals at the Justice Department to do their job.\n\nBut I agree, it's very important that the Attorney General be responsive to these allegations. He is, by the way. He's testified, I think, for hours and hours and hours before the committees. He's been very forthright in his answers, and I believe he will continue to do so.\n\nI'm confident that the Department of Justice can continue to serve the American people with honor and integrity, that they can continue to have the confidence of the American people. And the Attorney General assures me that since these allegations were made, he's has taken steps to ensure that we do not repeat mistakes that have been made.\n\nNow, I'll give you a little insight into how I think about these kinds of situations. I believe that in order for the system to work, there must be accountability. There must be people who are willing to take charge and make decisions.

We've had a very open society for many years, and I think that's one of our strengths.\n\nNow, in terms of your question about the tension between national security and the need to have a free press, I think it's always a delicate balance. On the one hand, we do need to protect sources and methods in order to be able to wage an effective war on terror. On the other hand, we do need to have a free press in order to hold people accountable.\n\nI think one of the keys is that we want to make sure that we're not squelching unfettered public debate. We want the American people to have access to a wide range of information and to be able to make their own judgments about what's going on.\n\nNow, in terms of specific decisions, such as the one with Osama bin Laden not being able to get on the air, well, I think that's a pretty easy call. The man is a terrorist, he's trying to kill Americans, and we don't want to give him a platform to be able to inspire other people to kill Americans.\n\nIn terms of discussions with the media, I think it's perfectly reasonable for my administration to talk to the media about sensitive information that might, in fact, put lives at risk if it were to be disclosed. And I'm sure that we've had some cordial, but direct conversations with various media outlets about what they can and cannot report.\n\nBut let me make one thing very clear: we're not trying to intimidate the press. We're not trying to tell the press what to report and what not to report. We're simply trying to make sure that we're able to balance our national security needs with our commitment to a free society.\n\nNow, I think the question, \"where is the line?\" is a good one. And I think the line is crossed when we start to see, for example, information that would allow terrorists to learn how to avoid our law enforcement activities or to create a threat to the security of the United States. That's when I think we've got to draw the line.\n\nAnd I'm confident that the vast majority of the American press understands that balance and is willing to work with us to get it right. And if we don't, I'm sure that the American people will let us know that we're not striking the right balance."

We have indeed been working together to develop a comprehensive plan to combat the effects of drug trafficking, and we are making good progress.\n\nNow, I know there have been some delays, and I'm glad you asked about that. The obstacle, frankly, is that this is a complex issue. It requires a coordinated effort from all three countries, and we need to make sure that we get it right. We're not just talking about throwing money at the problem or sending troops to the border. We're talking about a sustained effort to disrupt and dismantle the trafficking networks, to protect our citizens, and to support the brave men and women who are on the front lines of this fight.\n\nNow, regarding the support of the United States to Mexico, I can confirm that we are committed to providing significant assistance to our neighbor to the south. We believe that this is a shared problem that requires a shared solution. We are prepared to provide Mexico with the resources they need to take on the cartels, to strengthen their law enforcement institutions, and to protect their citizens.\n\nThe levels of support I've seen reports about \u2013 a tenfold increase \u2013 I'd say that's in the ballpark, but I'd rather not get into too many details here today. Let's just say that we're committed to providing substantial support to Mexico, and we're working closely with the Mexican government to determine the best way to use those resources.\n\nNow, I know there's been a lot of discussion about the model we're using. Some have compared it to the efforts we've made in Colombia. I think that's a fair comparison. We've learned a lot from our experience in Colombia, and we're applying those lessons to our efforts in Mexico.\n\nBut let me be clear: this is a unique situation, and we need to tailor our approach to the specific challenges we're facing. We're not just cutting and pasting a plan from Colombia and applying it to Mexico. We're working closely with the Mexican government to develop a plan that's tailored to their needs, their circumstances, and their priorities.\n\nAnd let me just say, finally, that I'm proud of the leadership that Mexico is showing on this issue. President Calder\u00f3n is a brave man, and he's showing real courage in the face of some very formidable adversaries. We stand with him, and we stand with the Mexican people, in this fight against the cartels.\n\nThank you."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for that question.  I've had a very good discussion with President Aznar about our mutual desire to fight terror.  And I want to thank him for carrying the torch for that fight here in Spain.\n\nFirst, let me just start by saying that, obviously, we respect the laws of Spain and the laws of any country we work with.  The death penalty or not, we will work with countries based on their laws and their systems.  That's the way the international system works.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of areas where we can cooperate, and we will cooperate with the Spanish government to bring terrorists to justice.  We can share intelligence.  We can cooperate on law enforcement.  We can work together to disrupt the financing of terror.  And we will do just that.\n\nOne of the things that I've learned in the fight against terror is, is that we're not just fighting terror, we're fighting the ideology that breeds terror.  And one of the ways to defeat that ideology is to spread freedom and liberty, and to help stabilize regions that are unstable.\n\nNow, the President and I have talked about a lot of these issues, and we've talked about the mission to help democracy in places like Afghanistan and Iraq.  And I want to thank him for Spain's contributions to the Iraqi mission.\n\nBut in terms of specific assistance, I think that what you're trying to get at is that there's a whole set of ways we can cooperate in the fight against terror, the death penalty not being one of them, obviously.  And we'll work within the systems of our respective countries to make sure that we're doing everything we can to bring terrorists to justice."

The United States has a moral obligation to act in the face of this pandemic, and we're committed to making a difference.\n\nNow, regarding the funding, I'd like to clarify the numbers. Our proposal is indeed a $15 billion commitment over five years, with a significant portion of those funds directed to Africa. The first year, we're allocating $2 billion, which includes a significant increase in funding from previous years.\n\nNow, I know there's been some discussion about the exact numbers, but I want to assure you and the American people that we are committed to following through on this pledge. I've already spoken with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and they're working closely with the Appropriations Committee to ensure that the necessary funds are allocated.\n\nAs President, I'm committed to making sure that our word is our bond, and we deliver on this critical initiative. I've also asked my advisors to work closely with Congressional leaders to ensure that we're able to meet our commitment.\n\nNow, I know that there's going to be some back-and-forth on the details, but let me be clear: our commitment to combating AIDS in Africa is unwavering, and we're going to follow through on our pledge.

You know, the FTAA, the Free Trade Area of the Americas, was a good effort, and I'm proud of the fact that we pushed hard to try to get a hemisphere-wide free trade agreement. However, as you mentioned, it didn't work out.\n\nI think the difference, though, is that the Doha Round of the WTO negotiations is a more focused effort. We're dealing with specific issues, particularly agriculture, industrial goods, and services. And I believe we can make progress on those specific issues.\n\nNow, I will say, the FTAA experience did teach us the importance of being more precise in our goals and having a clear timeline. That's one of the reasons why I've been pressing the G-8 + 5 countries to work hard to get a Framework Agreement by the end of July.\n\nAnd the reason I invited President Lula here was to reinforce our commitment to getting that Framework Agreement. We didn't have a deadline for the FTAA, and I think that was one of the shortcomings of that effort.\n\nIn terms of speaking the same language, I think that's a great metaphor. In trade negotiations, we must be clear about our goals and be willing to make concessions to achieve those goals. And I believe that President Lula and I do speak the same language when it comes to our commitment to free trade and global economic growth.\n\nAs for deadlines, I think having a deadline can be helpful, it can be a catalyst for action. And I did propose, and I think President Lula agrees, that we need to have a sense of urgency here. We can't let this opportunity slip away.\n\nNow, I don't want to pre-judge the outcome of our meeting in Washington, but I do think that having our trade ministers meet to discuss the details of a possible Framework Agreement is an important step. And I'm optimistic that we can make progress, not just in Washington but also here in Brazil. We've got a lot of work to do, but I'm confident that we can get it done."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for having me today. (pauses for a moment)\n\nFirst of all, I'm optimistic about the future of Africa. The continent is rich in natural resources, rich in talent, and has a deep desire for freedom and opportunity. But as you said, there are challenges that must be overcome. To address these challenges, Africa needs leaders who are committed to fighting corruption, who are committed to rule of law, and who are committed to economic freedom.\n\nOne of the things that I've seen in my presidency is that when countries make the decision to move towards democracy and to move towards economic freedom, the US stands with them. And we'll continue to do so. We'll continue to support countries that are making the tough decisions to fight corruption, to promote transparency, and to promote good governance.\n\nIn terms of what we can do to help, we've increased our aid to Africa over the past seven years. We've launched several initiatives to fight disease, such as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which has helped to save millions of lives across the continent. We've also launched initiatives to help stimulate economic growth, such as the African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n\nNow, I'm excited to be visiting five nations in Africa, including Ghana, Liberia, Benin, Tanzania, and Egypt. I'm looking forward to meeting with the leaders of these countries, to learn from them, and to share our vision for a prosperous and peaceful Africa.\n\nOne of the main reasons I decided to visit Africa on the last leg of my term is because I believe that the US has a vital interest in the future of this continent. Africa is a continent of growing economic importance, of growing strategic importance, and of growing moral importance.\n\nAs I prepare to leave office, I want to make sure that we're laying the foundation for a long-term partnership between the US and Africa. And I'm confident that the next administration will continue to build on the progress that we've made.\n\nBut one thing I do hope to achieve through this trip is to raise awareness among the American people about the importance of Africa to our nation's interests, and about the opportunities that exist for us to work together to promote peace, prosperity, and freedom across the continent.\n\nAnd finally, I want to say that I'm committed to ensuring that the work that we've started is continued and completed. I'm committed to working with the next administration to ensure a seamless transition, and to ensure that our commitment to Africa remains strong and remains a central part of our foreign policy."

I do think it is appropriate for individuals who are under investigation, regardless of their position, to cooperate with the relevant authorities. Invoking the Fifth Amendment is certainly a right that is afforded to all citizens in this great country of ours, but as a leader, I expect more from corporate America. In these uncertain times, when investor confidence is crucial, it is imperative that executives demonstrate transparency and accountability.\n\nMoving on to the second part of your question, regarding the Sarbanes proposal, I must say that our administration is committed to meaningful corporate governance reform. While we appreciate the Senator's efforts, we still have concerns about the independent board proposal as it stands. However, I am willing to be flexible and am committed to finding a solution that works. I have directed my staff to work closely with Congress to find common ground on this issue, and I remain open to the idea of an independent board with the right structure and mandate.\n\nIt's all about getting it right and ensuring that we have in place a regulatory framework that promotes transparency, accountability, and fairness in the corporate world. We want to create an environment that inspires investor confidence and helps to drive economic growth and job creation. So, while we may not be there yet, I'm hopeful that we can work together to find a solution that works for everybody."

While it's true that we've seen some concerning developments from North Korea, I believe we've made significant progress in laying the groundwork for future talks and building an international consensus on this issue.\n\nFirst, we've worked closely with our allies and partners in the Six-Party Talks \u2013 China, Japan, Russia, and South Korea \u2013 to present a unified front in our message to the North Koreans. We've also engaged in bilateral talks with China, which has a significant influence over the North Korean regime.\n\nSecond, we've been actively working with the United Nations to strengthen the international non-proliferation regime, including passage of UN Security Council Resolution 1718 condemning North Korea's nuclear test. This resolution demonstrates the global community's commitment to preventing nuclear proliferation and places increased pressure on North Korea to change its behavior.\n\nThird, we've taken steps to strengthen our bilateral relationships with Japan and South Korea, which are critical to regional security and stability. We've also increased our engagement with the North Korean defectors and refugees, listening to their stories and supporting their efforts to bring democratic change to their homeland.\n\nLastly, I'd like to remind you that we've also been making progress in interdiction and law-enforcement efforts, including working to disrupt illicit activities, and working to close all modalities by which the North Korean regime earns hard currency. That will pressure them in various ways.\n\nNow, I know that some may view these achievements as incremental, but I believe they represent significant progress in advancing our long-term goals of denuclearization and regional stability. We remain committed to a diplomatic solution to this crisis, but we will also continue to consider all options \u2013 diplomacy, defense, and other \u2013 to protect American interests and security."

I'd like to clarify that the United States has indeed been a strong supporter of Russia's efforts to join the WTO. However, as you know, this process is a complex and multilateral one, involving many countries and multiple issues.\n\nRegarding the current status of the negotiations, I'd like to say that we've made significant progress with Russia on many key issues, such as non-tariff barriers, services, and intellectual property rights. However, there are still some outstanding concerns that need to be addressed.\n\nOne of the main issues is Russia's domestic support for its agricultural sector. We've been working closely with the Russian government to ensure that their domestic support is in compliance with WTO rules, but we've not yet reached a mutually acceptable agreement.\n\nAdditionally, there are concerns regarding Russia's compliance with WTO rules on issues such as customs valuation and certification requirements. We're working with the Russian government to resolve these issues, and I'm hopeful that we can make progress in the coming months.\n\nI want to emphasize that our goal is to support Russia's accession to the WTO, not to impede it. We believe that Russia's membership in the WTO will be beneficial to both the Russian economy and the global trading system as a whole.\n\nI'd like to assure you that my Administration is committed to continuing the negotiations with Russia in good faith, and we're working to resolve the outstanding issues as soon as possible. But we also have to ensure that any agreement is in compliance with WTO rules and is in the best interests of the United States."

    "gen_response": "Well, first of all, I want to say that the United States and South Korea have a strong partnership, a strong alliance, and we're working closely together to address the challenges posed by North Korea. In my State of the Union address, I did label North Korea, along with Iraq and Iran, as part of an axis of evil. I did so because of their support for terror and their development of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nNow, I know that President Kim and the South Korean people have a unique perspective on North Korea, and we respect that. The sunshine policy is an important initiative, and we support the goal of improved relations between North and South Korea. However, our approach and the South Korean approach are not mutually exclusive.\n\nIn fact, I believe that our tough stance on North Korea's bad behavior can actually complement the sunshine policy. By standing firm against North Korean provocations, we're creating an environment where North Korea is more likely to take the sunshine policy seriously.\n\nNow, I've spoken with President Kim, and he's assured me that he shares my concerns about North Korea's actions. I think it's fair to say that we both believe that North Korea has more to do to demonstrate its sincerity.\n\nRegarding their sincerity, I think it's fair to say that their actions speak louder than their words. While they have made some gestures towards reform and openness, they still have a long way to go to demonstrate that they're genuinely committed to change.\n\nHowever, I do think that there are signs that North Korea is beginning to understand that isolation is not in their interests. They're facing tremendous economic challenges, and I think they're starting to realize that access to the international community, access to foreign investment, and access to economic assistance, are all conditioned on their behavior.\n\nNow, I'm not naive about North Korea. I know that they've made promises before and failed to deliver. But I also know that it's in our interests, in the interests of South Korea, and in the interests of the international community, to continue to engage with North Korea, to continue to talk to them, and to continue to press them to make good on their commitments.\n\nSo, I'm optimistic that progress can be made, but I'm also realistic about the challenges we face. We'll continue to work closely with President Kim and the South Korean government to address these challenges, and we'll do so in a way that respects the unique relationship between North and South Korea."

The United States has been supportive of Italy's participation in the P5+1 talks on Iran, and we continue to believe that Italy's involvement can be constructive in helping to address the Iranian nuclear issue.\n\nThat being said, our position, as Steve Hadley indicated, is that we're waiting to see how the dynamics of the P5+1 grouping develop, and how Italy's involvement plays out in those discussions. We're focused on finding a united approach that will effectively address Iran's nuclear ambitions, and we're working closely with all the parties to that end.\n\nSo, I'd say that our position is one of cautious optimism, and we're looking forward to seeing how the P5+1 talks unfold.

I'm not going to get into specifics about which countries will be participating and which ones won't, but I can tell you that we've had a significant amount of cooperation, and we're working hard to assemble a coalition that will help bring peace and stability to the region.\n\nRegarding the post-Iraq reconstruction, we are working closely with the United Nations. The Secretary-General Kofi Annan has been very cooperative, and we believe that the UN has a vital role to play in the reconstruction efforts in Iraq.

Well, let me start by saying that the United States is very supportive of Brazil and Petrobras's efforts to develop their own energy resources and to participate in the global energy market. That's a good thing. We also believe that all countries, including Brazil, should be mindful of the potential risks associated with investing in Iran's energy sector.\n\nYou see, Iran is a country that has refused to comply with the international community's demands to suspend its nuclear program. This is a concern for all of us who believe in the Non-Proliferation Treaty. And it's a concern because a nuclear Iran would pose a significant threat to regional and global stability.\n\nNow, the United States has made it clear that we strongly oppose investments in Iran's energy sector because we believe that such investments can help fund the Iranian regime's nuclear ambitions. We've got a problem with the current government in Iran. They're a destabilizing force in the region, and they're a threat to our friends and allies.\n\nNow, I want to make it very clear that our desire for Petrobras to refrain from investing in Iran is not meant to limit Brazil's energy diplomacy or to undermine Petrobras's business. On the contrary, we believe that there are many other countries and opportunities around the world where Petrobras can invest and grow, while also contributing to the stability of the global energy market.\n\nI hope that answers your question. And I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this issue further with President Lula and with all of you."

As you know, our policy towards both North Korea and Iran is focused on non-proliferation, particularly when it comes to nuclear arms. And we take the threat posed by both regimes very seriously.\n\nIn the case of North Korea, we've made it clear that their pursuit of nuclear weapons is unacceptable. And we're working through the six-party talks to encourage Kim Jong-il to abandon his nuclear ambitions and return to the negotiating table. We believe that a diplomatic solution is the best way forward, and we're working closely with our partners, including China, Japan, and Russia, to achieve that goal.\n\nRegarding Iran, we also believe that their nuclear program is a threat to the stability of the region and to the global non-proliferation regime. We're working with the Europeans and the Russians to encourage Iran to comply with its international obligations and to abandon its nuclear enrichment activities. We've made it clear that all options are on the table, but our preferred course of action is a diplomatic one.\n\nNow, I know that some of you may be thinking, \"Well, what about regime change?\" Let me be clear: our policy is not focused on regime change in either North Korea or Iran. Our focus is on changing the behavior of these regimes, not on changing the regimes themselves.\n\nHaving said that, we do believe that the people of both North Korea and Iran deserve to live in freedom and under governments that are accountable to them. And we'll continue to support those who are working towards that goal, including human rights activists and pro-democracy groups.\n\nBut let me be clear: we will not preemptively use military force to achieve regime change. Our military options are always on the table, but they will only be used as a last resort, and in the most extreme circumstances.\n\nSo, to answer your question, our policy is focused on non-proliferation, diplomatic engagement, and supporting those who are working towards democratic change."

We're troubled by the reports of harassment and detention of people who express dissent, who try to exercise their fundamental human rights. We've raised these concerns with the Chinese government, and we'll continue to do so.\n\nNow, I also want to say that we recognize China's progress on economic reforms and the steps they've taken to improve the lives of their people.

We're making progress in training Iraqi forces, and we're making progress in consolidating democratic reforms. It's difficult, but we'll stay the course.

This is a critical issue that we're working to address, and we're working with the Iraqi government to help them build a more inclusive and representative government that can address these sectarian tensions.\n\nIn terms of a security plan, we're working with the Iraqi government to implement a comprehensive strategy that includes not only military action but also economic development, political reconciliation, and social programs to address the root causes of the violence. It's a complex and difficult challenge, but we're making progress and we're committed to supporting the Iraqi people as they work to build a more secure and stable country.\n\nRegarding the situation in Lebanon, I want to emphasize that our goal is to support the Lebanese people and help them defend themselves against the terrorist organization Hezbollah. We're providing humanitarian aid to those who have been affected by the conflict, and we're also working with Israel to help them defend themselves against the attacks that have been launched by Hezbollah. \n\n-Israel has a right to defend itself, and part of that defense includes the use of modern and sophisticated military equipment, including, among other things, precision-guided munitions. \n\nNow, I know that this situation is complex and it's tense, and there are many different perspectives on it.

Now, we understand that the situation in Iraq is the central front in the war on terror, and that the challenges we're facing are real.\n\nRegarding Iraq, I do think that our policy has been and continues to be, to support the Iraqi government and to help them become a stable, self-sufficient, and democratic country. The Iraqi Prime Minister, Maliki, has stated that he agrees with our goal, and we're working closely together to help him strengthen the government.\n\nNow, as for Arab governments criticizing Israel, I think that's an understandable, you know, commentary. I've always said that our allies, Arab countries, have got to be able to criticize Israel, without fear of being criticized themselves. It's just part of the ongoing conversation, John.\n\nHowever, concerning Iran and Syria's support for Hezbollah, we have been very clear and consistent in our warnings to both countries to cease their support. We're not going to tolerate this sort of violent destabilizing behavior in the region, particularly not in Lebanon.\n\nThe idea that my words aren't being listened to is just not right, however. Our allies are listening, our friends are listening, and I believe the American people are united in the face of this terror threat.\n\nI think history has proven that we, as America, are not short-term thinkers, and I would say that your perception and your analysis might not be shared by others, and I'm not saying that you're wrong either, but it's more complex.

We've got a lot of work ahead of us to make sure this happens, and we'll continue to work with the Quartet to come up with a mechanism that will make sure that both parties are held accountable.\n\nBut let me make one thing very clear: we will not impose our will on either the Israelis or the Palestinians. We will work with them in a constructive way, but at the end of the day, it's the parties themselves who must make the tough decisions to achieve peace."

I'm deeply troubled by the news out of Guatemala, particularly the murder of those three Salvadoran Congress Members. Our condolences go out to the families and the people of El Salvador.\n\nNow, regarding our strategy, we do indeed believe that this problem requires a regional approach. We can't just focus on one country; we need to work with all the countries in Central America to tackle this threat. That's why we're committed to working closely with the governments in the region, including Guatemala.\n\nNow, the U.S. has a long-standing commitment to helping countries in the region combat narco-trafficking and organized crime. We've got a number of programs in place, including the Central America Regional Security Initiative, which provides funding and assistance to help these countries build their capacity to fight this threat.\n\nRegarding the issue of a \"mini-Colombia Plan,\" I think what we're looking at is a comprehensive approach that involves not just military assistance, but also economic assistance, law enforcement assistance, and judiary reform. We need to make sure that we're addressing the root causes of this problem, which is poverty and lack of opportunity, as well as the institutional weaknesses that allow these traffickers to operate.\n\nIn terms of U.S. cooperation, we're committed to working closely with the government of Guatemala and other governments in the region to provide the necessary assistance to help them tackle this problem. That includes providing training and equipment to their law enforcement and military forces, as well as providing intelligence and logistical support.\n\nWe're also working closely with the government of Guatemala to address the issue of corruption, which is a major obstacle to progress in this area. We need to make sure that we're supporting the institutions that are going to help Guatemala and other countries in the region to build a more just and equitable society.\n\nRegarding the investigation into the murder of the Salvadoran Congress Members, we're cooperating fully with the government of El Salvador and the government of Guatemala to get to the bottom of this heinous crime. We'll provide any assistance we can to help bring those responsible to justice.\n\nSo, I hope that gives you a sense of our commitment to this issue and our willingness to work with the governments in the region to tackle this problem."

Regarding Cuba, our policy is clear: we will continue to support the Cuban people in their quest for freedom, while maintaining pressure on the Castro regime to reform. The embargo remains an important tool in our efforts to bring about democratic change and respect for human rights on the island.\n\nNow, I know that some of our European allies have differing views on this matter, and we respect those differences. But we also believe that our embargo is a necessary component of our overall strategy to promote freedom in Cuba. We will continue to work with our allies to seek a world where the Cuban people are free to determine their own fate.\n\nRegarding Plan Colombia, we are committed to continuing our support for President Uribe and the Colombian government as they work to bring stability and security to their country. We believe that our partnership with Colombia is critical to the region's stability and to our own national security interests.\n\nWe will continue to work with our friends in Colombia to help them address the challenges posed by narcoterrorism and to support their efforts to promote economic development and reform. I've had the chance to talk to President Uribe a number of times, and I'm impressed by his courage and commitment to bringing peace and prosperity to his country.\n\nSo, in short, we will continue to pursue our policies in these areas, even as we work to build stronger relationships with our friends and allies in the region."

As I've said before, I believe that marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman, and I oppose same-sex marriage. I understand that there are people who disagree with me on this issue, and I respect their opinions.\n\nHowever, I still firmly believe that society's interest is best served by upholding the traditional definition of marriage. I know that this issue is complex and emotional, and it's one that affects many people in a very personal way.\n\nRegarding the children, I believe that every child deserves a loving and stable home, regardless of the circumstances of their birth or the relationship status of their parents. I think it's essential to support all families, including those with same-sex couples, but I also believe that children are best raised in a home with a married mother and father.\n\nThat being said, I understand the significance of the situation in San Francisco and the images that came from that. But I don't believe that the actions of Mayor Newsom changed the fundamental nature of this issue. As a matter of fact, I believe that the traditional definition of marriage has been an essential part of our society for centuries, and it's worth preserving.\n\n(firmly but calmly) I want to be clear: as President, I will continue to promote policies that support traditional marriage and the well-being of all families, including those with same-sex couples, but I will also defend the traditional institution of marriage."

We're working closely with our British allies to see a peaceful resolution to this crisis. As for the British considering a military option, that's for them to decide, but I think it's clear that they're exploring all avenues to resolve this situation.\n\nRegarding whether the U.S. would consider a similar action an act of war, I think it's safe to say that we would take any situation involving the taking of our service members very seriously. We'll always reserve the right to defend ourselves and our people, and we'll do whatever is necessary to protect American lives and interests.\n\nNow, regarding the five Iranians who were captured in Irbil, we've made it clear that we're willing to consider the release of those individuals if it would help resolve the crisis and if it would help to reduce tensions. However, any decision on this front would have to be made in consultation with our coalition partners and in a way that's consistent with our long-term goals in the region.\n\nI want to emphasize that our goal is to resolve this crisis peacefully, and we'll continue to work with all parties to achieve that objective."

As I reflect on the past year, I believe it's safe to say that the Democratic leadership in Congress had high ambitions, but they have not been able to deliver on some of their key promises, particularly when it comes to the war in Iraq.\n\nBy passing the war funding without strings, Congress has shown that, despite our disagreements, we can work together to fund our troops and support their mission. I believe this is a testament to the commitment of members of Congress from both parties to do what's right, even if we disagree.\n\nNow, as for whether I've gotten my way, I'd say that I've worked hard to build coalitions and find common ground, while also being clear about my non-negotiables \u2013 like keeping our troops well-funded and keeping America safe. I think that's good governing.\n\nRegarding my relations with the leaders of Congress, I think it's no surprise that we've had our disagreements \u2013 after all, we're from different parties and have fundamentally different views on some important issues. But I believe we've been able to work together, albeit not always smoothly, to get some important things done.\n\nI will say that the Democrats set the bar high for themselves last year, and the public has expectations that they'll be able to deliver on those promises. And while they've certainly passed some legislation, there's still a lot of work to be done on the bigger issues, like immigration reform and Social Security reform.\n\nIn the end, I think it's healthy for our democracy to have a robust debate and a give-and-take between the branches of government. As President, my job is to lead and advocate for what I believe is in the best interests of the country. If that sometimes means using my veto pen to make a point or block something I think is a bad idea, so be it."

As you mentioned, the Pope's concerns were primarily with the creation of embryonic stem cells for research purposes. I understand and respect that view.\n\nHowever, our conversation did touch on the existing stem cells that are available for research. I explained to the Pope that these cells are typically embryonic stem cells that were created prior to my taking office, and that they are currently being used by researchers across the country.\n\nAs for options and compromises, I'm considering a number of proposals that have been put forth by lawmakers, scientists, and ethicists. Some of these options include allowing research on existing stem cell lines, while others propose creating a limited number of new stem cell lines using embryonic cells that would otherwise be discarded. There are also proposals that suggest alternative methods for deriving stem cells, such as using adult stem cells or somatic cell nuclear transfer.\n\nIt's a complex issue, and I'm taking my time to consider all the different perspectives and opinions. I want to make sure that any decision I make is grounded in both moral and scientific principles. I'm committed to advancing the hope of medical breakthroughs that stem cell research holds, while also upholding the values that are at the core of our society.\n\nThat's all I can say for now.

As you know, the events of September 11th have changed the landscape in many ways, and our priorities have shifted to address the threat of terrorism. However, our commitment to defending our nation and our allies remains unwavering. We have been engaged in discussions with Russia to better understand their perspective on theabilmek Ballistic Missile Treaty, but I will not rule out any option that is in the best interest of our national security. We will continue to pursue diplomatic efforts to find a resolution that meets our concerns, but we will not be limited by a treaty that was written for a different era.\n\nRegarding the Muslim world and the Arab world, I am pleased with the support we have received, and I believe it's essential to acknowledge that many leaders have spoken out against terrorism. While there could have been more vocal statements, we have seen a broad coalition of nations condemn the acts of terror. It's also important to recognize that we're not at war with Islam, but against the terrorists who claim to act in its name. We're working closely with our friends and allies in the region to combat terrorism, promote understanding, and address the root causes of this problem.\n\nI'm heartened by the cooperation we've received from leaders in the region, such as Pakistan's President Musharraf and Jordan's King Abdullah, who have been instrumental in our fight against terrorism. We will continue to work together to ensure that this is a broad-based effort to deal with a shared threat, and that we stand together to defend innocent lives and the values of freedom, justice, and peace."

Instead, brave as they were, they fought to the end, and in doing so, they were killed in the battle. And that's what I meant by executed.\n\nNow, regarding your main question, I want to address the issue of international support for our efforts in Iraq. I agree that it's true that some of our traditional allies, like France and Germany, have not supported our position on this war. However, I also want to remind you that we have a strong coalition, including many countries from around the world, who have stood with us in this fight for freedom and democracy.\n\nNow, I understand the reservations that some of our friends may have had. But let me be clear: the United States of America did not make this decision to act in a vacuum. We did it because we were attacked on September 11th. Nearly 3,000 innocent lives were lost. And we will not forget the fact that Saddam Hussein, a brutal dictator, was a threat to the stability of the region and to our national security.\n\nI've talked to our allies, and many of them share our concerns about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein and the rogue states who harbor and support terrorists. And I believe that over time, as more and more countries see the progress we're making in Iraq, they will come to understand that our efforts are aimed at a just cause, spreading freedom and peace in a region that's been troubled for too long.\n\nI also want to remind you that just because we didn't have a unanimous vote at the United Nations does not mean that we don't have the support of many nations around the world who share our values and our goals. And I'm willing to continue working with our friends and allies to build a strong and united front against the forces of terror and tyranny.\n\nThank you."

Now, I want to clarify the difference between what I said and what the generals said.\n\nWhen I mentioned those numbers, I was referring to the fact that there are Iraqi battalions that are being trained, that are in the process of being trained, and some that are deployed. Now, when the generals went up to the Hill, they were asked a specific question about, \"How many are capable of, or fully deployed and battle ready?\"\n\nNow, I think it's fair to say that there's a difference between those two questions. We're making progress, but I also acknowledge that the situation on the ground is challenging, and we've got to continue to work with the Iraqis to build their capacity.\n\nThe fact is, we are making progress. The Iraqis are taking on more responsibility. We are reducing the number of our troops. And we've got a strategy that's working. But I also acknowledge that we still have got more work to be done.\n\nNow, I know that some Senators have raised questions, and I respect that. But I think it's also important to take a step back and recognize the progress we're making, and the fact that we're on the right course. We've got to keep our focus on the enemy, on al-Qaeda and on the extremist groups that are trying to stop the Iraqi people from determining their own future.\n\nSo, I understand there's a difference, and I think I might have misspoken, might have spoken too quickly on that occasion. But the fact is, we are making progress, and we need to keep our focus on the overall strategy and supporting the Iraqi people in their fight for freedom and democracy."

First of all, let me remind you that the war on terror is a global fight, and it's a fight for our way of life. And I understand the concerns of our allies, like Australia, and the good people of Sydney, who are, you know, feeling the pressures of this global conflict.\n\nRegarding Iraq, I firmly believe that we're making progress towards reconciliation. The Iraqi people are taking control of their country, and the Iraqi Security Forces are becoming increasingly capable of defending themselves against the insurgents.\n\nNow, as for the opposition leader's view on staged withdrawal, I respectfully disagree. You see, we cannot give the enemy a timetable for our departure. That would be a recipe for disaster. It would embolden the enemy, and it would undermine the very progress we're making.\n\nWhen I meet with the opposition leader tomorrow, I'll remind him that our strategy in Iraq is conditions-based, not calendar-driven. We will continue to review the situation on the ground, and we will make adjustments as necessary. But we will not let the terrorists dictate our schedule.\n\nI'll also remind him that we're making progress on the political front, with the Iraqi elections, the formation of a government, and the drafting of a constitution. We're making progress on the economic front, with the international community supporting Iraq's reconstruction efforts.\n\nWe will not abandon the Iraqi people to the mercy of the terrorists. We will continue to support them in their quest for freedom and democracy, and we will do so in a way that's responsible and conditions-based."

Now, I believe that the tax cuts we've implemented have been the right thing to do. They've put more money in people's pockets, and it's helped stimulate economic growth.\n\nNow, I know that the unemployment rate has risen, and that's a concern. But I think it's also important to look at the long-term picture here. We've created over 7 million new jobs since I took office, and I think that's a testament to the robustness of the American economy.\n\nNow, I will admit that the deficit is a concern. We're going to have to work hard to make sure that we're living within our means and making smart fiscal decisions. But I don't think the answer is to raise taxes. I think that would be a mistake. Raising taxes would stifle economic growth and hinder our ability to recover from this recession.\n\nIn terms of evidence that the tax cuts are working, I'd point to the fact that revenue is coming in higher than expected, even in these tough economic times. That's a sign that the economy is still growing, and that the tax cuts are helping to stimulate that growth.\n\nNow, I'm open to new ideas and new approaches. I'm always willing to listen to different perspectives and consider different solutions. But I'm confident that our economic policies are on the right track, and I think we're going to see continued growth and progress in the months and years ahead.\n\nOne thing I do want to mention is that we've got a global economy that's affecting our economy here at home. The slowdown in Europe, the slowdown in Asia, that's having an impact on America. But I'm confident in the resilience of the American economy, and I'm confident in the American people's ability to overcome any challenge that comes our way."

Now, I do believe that the United Nations has a vital role to play in the world, and we've worked closely with them in many areas, particularly in areas of humanitarian aid and development.\n\nBut when it comes to the question of legitimacy and moral authority, I think it's interesting that you bring up the fact that the United Nations has its own set of challenges. And I think that's a fair point. I think that the United States and the United Nations are both held to high standards, and we should be. We should be held to high standards when it comes to our actions, our decisions, and our accountability.\n\nBut I think the key difference is that in a democratic society like ours, we have the checks and balances, we have the system of accountability and oversight that allows us to hold our elected officials and government agencies accountable for their actions. And I think that's what sets us apart from some of the challenges that the United Nations faces.\n\nNow, I think it's also important to remember that we didn't act alone in Iraq. We had a coalition of 30 nations that worked with us to bring about a new era of freedom and democracy to the Iraqi people. And I think that's a testament to the fact that we're not alone in this effort, and that there are many other nations that share our values and our commitment to freedom and democracy.\n\nSo, while I think the United Nations has a role to play, I also think that the United States has a unique set of strengths and abilities that allow us to lead the world in many areas, particularly in areas of freedom and democracy.

But I also recognize that this is going to be a difficult task, and it's going to require a lot of diplomacy, and a lot of work on the part of the Lebanese government, the international community, and the peacekeeping forces.\n\nNow, I'm not going to prejudge how this is going to be done, or when. But I do believe that the world is watching, and that the world will hold the Lebanese government and Hizballah accountable for their actions. And if the Lebanese government is to have a complete monopoly on the use of force within its territory, then that means that Hizballah is going to have to disarm.\n\nI also want to note that I'm heartened to see that the international community is working hard to ensure that the Lebanese government is empowered, or that it's given the support it needs to be able to fulfill its functions and maintain control over its territory.\n\nBut make no mistake, the international community is not going to set a deadline, and say, \"You've got to dissolve Hizballah's military wing by December 1st of 2006.\" It's going to be a process that's going to require a lot of work, a lot of cooperation, and a lot of determination.

We are, indeed, facing a deteriorating situation in some parts of Iraq. There are still those who do not want us to succeed \u2013 the terrorists and the insurgents \u2013 and we're seeing an increase in sectarian violence, which, I must say, is disturbing.\n\nHowever, I want to remind the American people that our strategy is not just military; it's also economic and diplomatic. We're working closely with the new Iraqi government to address the root causes of the violence. We believe that as the Iraqi security forces become more capable, they'll be able to handle their own security. And our job is to train them so that they can.\n\nRegarding the American forces being drawn into the fighting, our troops are doing a wonderful job. They're assisting the Iraqi security forces, and they're helping to stabilize the country. But I must tell you, the situation in some parts of Iraq, particularly Baghdad and parts of the west, is more challenging than we thought. We're adapting our strategy to meet the changing circumstances.\n\nNow, on the decision on the way ahead, we'll be watching the situation closely. We'll continue to review our strategy with our commanders and the Iraqi government, and we'll make adjustments as necessary. We'll take into account the assessment of our generals, and I've asked our commanders to give me a frank and honest assessment of the situation on the ground.\n\nOn the issue of Tibet and the crackdown, I'm deeply concerned. I believe China's actions are unacceptable. The crackdown on Tibetans and the denial of basic human rights are, in our view, wrong. We have spoken clearly to the Chinese government about our concerns. I spoke with President Hu Jintao about this issue just a few days ago. We believe that the Chinese government should respect the rights of its citizens, and we will continue to speak out on this issue.\n\nWe value our relationship with China \u2013 it's an important relationship \u2013 but we can't shy away from speaking out on issues that are consistent with our values. We believe that this is a human rights issue, not just a Tibetan issue.

I did have a very productive discussion with President Jiang, and I'm pleased to report that the Chinese are cooperating with us in a number of ways, and we appreciate their cooperation.\n\nThe single most important contribution that China could make, in my judgment, is to use its influence with the government of Pakistan to encourage them to crack down on the remnants of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda within Pakistan. We believe that those elements pose a threat, not just to America, but to the Pakistan government, and to the broader South Asian region.\n\nAnd I can tell you that President Jiang listened to my concerns, and I believe that the Chinese are willing to work with us to encourage the Pakistanis to be more aggressive in cracking down on these elements.

The issue of weapons of mass destruction and their potential proliferation to terrorists or rogue states is indeed a grave concern for our nation and for the international community.

We're working closely with the Russians to enhance the security of their nuclear arsenal, and we're providing significant assistance to help them in this effort.\n\nRegarding the Russian Government's performance in securing their WMDs, I must say that I believe they're making efforts, but there's more work to be done. We've seen some progress in certain areas, such as the streamlining of their nuclear stockpile, but we need to see more consistent and robust security measures in place to prevent the theft or diversion of these materials.\n\nTo those critics who argue that our arms reduction efforts will lead to more opportunities for terrorists to get access to nuclear materials, I would say that's a misconception. Our approach is a careful and calculated one. We're reducing nuclear warheads, but we're also taking steps to ensure that the materials are safely stored and properly secured. In fact, our Nunn-Lugar program, which provides assistance to Russia to store and secure their nuclear materials, has already seen significant success.\n\nSo, we believe that the approach we're taking is a responsible and prudent one, and it takes into account the very real concerns about proliferation that you mentioned. We'll continue to work closely with the Russians and with our international partners to address this critical issue."

You've got to let the leaders of both parties work through some very difficult issues.\n\nSo, instead of imposing a specific timetable, what we're doing is setting clear goals. And that's what we're doing at the conference in Annapolis \u2013 making sure both sides understand what's at stake, which is a two-state solution, and making sure the Palestinian side is committed to recognizing Israel's right to exist.\n\nIt's not easy, I know. It's a tough issue. But I believe we can make progress, and I'm committed to it, because I believe in freedom. And the reason I believe a two-state solution is necessary is that people should be free to live in their own country, to pursue their own dreams, and we've got a chance to make that happen in the Middle East.\n\nThank you."

    "gen_response": "Well, thank you for the question. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify our position on this matter. First, let me say that the reason for the initial decision not to comment on the Israeli operation was to respect the confidentiality of our relationships with our allies and the sensitivities of the region.\n\nHowever, as more information became available, we felt it was in the national interest to declassify certain aspects of that intelligence. I want to be clear that this decision was not taken lightly. We did it because we believe it was essential to make clear the nature of the threat posed by this activity.\n\nThis facility, as shown in the declassified imagery, was clearly under construction with the assistance of North Korea, and its intended purpose was not peaceful. It was a direct challenge to the non-proliferation regime and to the efforts of all responsible nations to prevent the spread of nuclear capabilities to rogue states.\n\nAs for the timing, I understand the concern of lawmakers on Capitol Hill. But I want to assure them that we have been actively engaged with Congress throughout this process, providing updates and assessments as the situation evolved.\n\nLet me be clear: this administration takes very seriously our commitment to keeping Congress informed, while also being mindful of the need to protect sensitive information and sources and methods. We will continue to work closely with Congress to provide them the necessary information, while also taking into account the complexities of the situation.\n\nIn terms of what we hope this would accomplish, the releasing of this information highlights the threat posed by the transfer of sensitive nuclear technologies from North Korea, and it underscores the need for international cooperation to address this challenge.\n\nI want to make it clear that we will continue to work with our international partners to strengthen the non-proliferation regime and to hold accountable those who violate it."

Let me start by saying that I'm deeply troubled by the incidents you mentioned, particularly the noose found at a college campus. That's unacceptable in America, and it's a painful reminder that we still have work to do to overcome the legacy of racism.\n\nRegarding the case in Jena, Louisiana, I've been briefed on the situation, and I'm confident that the Justice Department is closely monitoring the developments. It's essential that the justice system runs its course, and I urge everyone to respect the rule of law.\n\nRegarding the state of race relations in our party, I can tell you that we've made significant strides in recent years to reach out to African American and Hispanic communities. We've worked hard to increase minority representation within the party, and we've had some important successes. However, I recognize that we still have more work to do to address the concerns and the distrust that exists in some of these communities.\n\nThe immigration debate has indeed been challenging, and I acknowledge that our efforts to pass comprehensive immigration reform were not successful. However, I want to assure you that our commitment to finding a fair and reasonable solution to this issue remains strong.\n\nRegarding the decision by some Republican presidential candidates not to participate in certain debates, I can only speak for myself. I believe it's essential for our party to engage with diverse communities, and I encourage all of our candidates to follow suit. Our party should be about big-tent thinking, not exclusionary practices.\n\nWe still have a long way to go to achieve true equality of opportunity for all Americans. As president, I remain committed to advancing our efforts to address these issues, and I urge all Americans to join me in this effort. We should strive for a country where every individual is treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or the color of their skin."

I believe that the efforts of President Clinton, my predecessor, were a good start in this direction, and I think our role can be supportive and constructive.\n\nThat being said, our commitment in Colombia must be within the realm of realism, and I'm committed to ensuring that we continue to assess this plan carefully and make adjustments where necessary, and I will make a full assessment of Plan Colombia in the coming weeks.\n\nNow, with regards to the free trade area of the Americas, I do indeed plan to make progress towards a free trade agreement. This summit in Quebec will be very important for setting a direction and worthy goals. I intend to work closely with Congress, not just on this issue but many others, and as for fast-track, I don't want to prejudge how the process will unfold.\n\nWe'll be taking soundings from the members of Congress as to whether or not fast-track will assist us in our negotiations, but my administration remains committed to liberalizing trade and promoting the expansion of markets across this hemisphere, and we think that the free trade area of the Americas can be an important building block for that effort, and we will press ahead with it."

We're having productive discussions with NATO and individual European countries on this issue, and I'm confident that we'll get the support we need.\n\nNow, on the issue of sharing technology and investment, I'm happy to report that we're already working with European companies on this front. We recognize that no one country can do this alone, and we're willing to share the burden and the benefits of missile defense with our allies.\n\nRegarding Italy specifically, we have a long-standing relationship with the Italian defense industry, and we're exploring opportunities for collaboration on missile defense technology. We believe that Italian companies have a lot to offer in this area, and we're willing to consider partnerships and investments that can benefit both our countries.\n\nOn the specifics of the investment, I don't want to get into exact numbers, but I will say that we're committed to making this a affordable and cost-effective system. We're looking at a range of options for funding and partnerships, and we're exploring ways to share the costs and benefits with our allies. But I want to assure the American people and our European partners that we'll make sure that any investments we make will be fiscally responsible and will deliver the capabilities we need to defend ourselves.\n\nSo, to answer your question, we're open to partnerships and investments with European companies, including Italian companies, as we move forward on missile defense."

I'm proud of our troops, and I think the Iraqi people are proud of our troops, too. They're making great sacrifices, and we're making progress.\n\nRegarding the Iraqi security forces, I agree that the police have been a challenge. We've got a lot of work to do there. But let me tell you, the Iraqi Army, the ISF, has been making great strides. I mean, they're beginning to take more and more responsibility for security in the country, and that's a positive development.\n\nRegarding the new government, I'm optimistic about their chances. They've got a tough road ahead of them, no question about it. But I believe Prime Minister al-Maliki is committed to the process. I believe he's committed to results. And I believe he's got some good people around him.\n\nNow, I will say this: We've got a lot of work to do with the Iraqi police. And that's why we've put together a strategy to try to bring trust back to the police. I mean, it's tough, because a lot of folks in Iraq don't trust the police. And we've got to help them work through that.\n\nBut I still believe the Iraqi people, by and large, want democracy to succeed. They want to be free. They want to live in peace. And I think our job is to try to help them achieve those objectives.\n\nAnd I think I'd also point out that it's a measured progress. We're making progress. It's not going to happen overnight. There have been setbacks, I understand that. I know the expectations for the situation in Iraq are extremely high. But I will not let you predict either the Iraqis will fail and will falter.\n\nWe've got important work to do in Iraq. But I've got to believe and the Iraqi people have to believe, that we can succeed."

The NIE report is a snapshot in time, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely.\n\nAs for our policy towards Iran, I want to be clear: we will not tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran. The threat of a nuclear Iran is a threat to the entire region, and we will use all means at our disposal to prevent it from happening.\n\nI understand the concerns of our allies, including Israel, about our commitment to addressing this issue. Let me assure you, we will take all necessary steps to address the threat posed by Iran's nuclear program. We will continue to work with our international partners, including through the UN Security Council, to ratchet up pressure on the Iranian regime to comply with its international obligations.\n\nAnd let me be clear: all options are on the table. We will not take any option off the table, but we will use our diplomatic efforts, our economic sanctions, and other means to persuade the Iranian regime to abandon its nuclear ambitions.\n\nThank you.

    "gen_response": "Well, I appreciate the question. I think it's very important to talk about the role of a free press in a healthy democracy. And I must say, I'm a little surprised by the suggestion that we don't talk about these issues in the United States. We do talk about these issues, and we take them very seriously.\n\nWhile it's true that there have been some high-profile incidents involving journalists and their treatment by the U.S. government, I believe that the United States has a robust system of protections for a free press. And I think it's fair to say that our media outlets are generally free to report on the news as they see fit, without fear of reprisal from the government.\n\nNow, I'm not naive, and I know that there have been some incidents where journalists have been showcased, or in some cases, have been subject to surveillance. But these are exceptions rather than the rule. And in each instance, it's been brought out, it's been exposed, and it's been corrected.\n\nIn Russia, and in a number of other countries, we see a very different situation. In many cases, journalists are subject to intimidation, to harassment, and in some cases, to outright censorship. And this is a matter of great concern, because we believe that a free press is essential to the functioning of a healthy democracy.\n\nI would have to respectfully disagree with the suggestion that the coverage in your media is the same as the kind of reporting we see in a truly free press. While you may be printing coverage of manifestations and protests, I'm not convinced that that's the same as having a truly free press, where journalists are free to hold their leaders accountable, without fear of reprisal.\n\nNow, with all due respect, I think this is an important distinction. And I hope that one day, all countries, including Russia, will enjoy the kind of protections for a free press that we enjoy in the United States."

What I've learned, and what I think is important, is that this was a complicated and intense time in Washington. A lot of people were working hard to address the real and perceived threats to our national security.\n\nNow, I do think that some of the conduct, revealed by this investigation, particularly the way some in the media and in politics sought to demonize and intimidate people who disagreed with them, well, that's just not the kind of politics I'm comfortable with. That's not the kind of behavior I condone.\n\nAs for rebuilding credibility, I'm gonna keep working hard to serve the American people to the best of my ability. I'll continue to focus on our main initiatives: providing security for our country, growing the economy, and helping those in need.\n\nBut I'm also gonna make sure that my administration reflects the, uh, values of honesty, integrity, and respect for the institutions that have made this country great. And I'll keep working to earn back, based on my actions, the trust of the American people.\n\nAnd I believe, over time, that's what it's all about.

But I believe that a Free Trade Agreement of the Americas, a hemispheric free trade agreement, is in the best interests of all countries in our hemisphere, including Brazil.\n\nWe do believe, as I've said before, that 2005 is a reasonable deadline for completing the FTAA, or the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas. We do believe that with focus and commitment, it's possible to accelerate that process, and we believe that would be beneficial for all countries involved.\n\nI will discuss this with President Cardoso tomorrow, and I will explain to him why we think it's in the interests of Brazil and all countries in the hemisphere to move forward on a free trade agreement that includes all the countries of the hemisphere. I think there's a sense of momentum building, and I think President Cardoso will recognize that momentum.\n\nWe'll work together to see if we can't find a way to get this done sooner rather than later. That's the American spirit, the spirit of cooperation and optimism. And I think we can work this out in a way that benefits all countries in the hemisphere.\n\nIn terms of convincing President Cardoso, I think I've just got to be myself and explain the benefits of free trade. And I believe that when countries trade with each other, they become more prosperous and more peaceful. I think that's the message that will resonate not just with President Cardoso, but with leaders throughout our hemisphere."

We have to get it right, and we have to be willing to take a step back and allow the parties to reach agreement and help facilitate this and to become active.\n\nA number of things will have to happen before \u2013 you know, there has to be a agreement reached between the chance of to amend the constitution.

The Russians, after all, have been victims of terrorism themselves. They understand the threat of terrorist networks. And I believe we can work together to find ways to cooperate on that front.\n\nNow, I made my position clear to Vladimir Putin that we're going to work together wherever possible, but where we disagree, we'll do so in a respectful and civilized manner. And we will continue to work to find ways to persuade Russia that it's in their interest to work with us, particularly on issues of proliferation and the threat of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nBut I think it's also important to recognize that this is a relationship that's still evolving.

I also understand the concerns of the Congress, and I'm working closely with our Congressional leaders to find a solution.\n\nRegarding the specific contents of the classified pages, I want to make it clear that I'm limited in what I can discuss publicly. But I will say that the information in those pages does involve some sensitive matters related to Saudi Arabia and the actions of certain Saudi individuals.\n\nNow, I don't want to give the impression that the Saudi government was behind the 9/11 attacks. That's not what this is about. What we're looking at is the actions of a small group of individuals, and we're trying to determine if there were any support networks or financing that may have come from within Saudi Arabia.\n\nWe're working to declassify as much of the information as we can, while also protecting our national security and sources and methods.

    "gen_response": "Thank you for that question. I appreciate it.\n\nFirst of all, let me just say, our coalition in Iraq is strong and it's vital to the success of our mission. And I reject the characterization that it's window dressing. Just because some countries aren't putting as many troops on the ground as others doesn't mean they're not making a vital contribution. For example, Japan is providing significant support, as is South Korea, in terms of money and supplies.\n\nNow, I'll give you an example of some countries that have made a significant contribution in the past, such as Poland. They've had troops on the ground and, unfortunately, they've suffered some casualties. So, I think it's unfair to characterize the coalition as window dressing.\n\nRegarding the issue of private contractors, I think it's a legitimate question. And the answer is, we need these contractors to help us with a number of missions, such as logistics and guard duty, which frees up our military to focus on what they do best \u2013 which is fighting and rebuilding this country.\n\nNow, I will say, I've asked our NATO allies to do more. And I think, over time, they'll do more. Germany, for example, has made a significant commitment to training Iraqi security forces. France is helping with the construction of a Baghdad police academy. So, while it may not be in the headlines every single day, there are a number of countries that are stepping up and helping.\n\nAnd I'll tell you this \u2013 our coalition is necessary for the long-term success of the mission in Iraq. We'll continue to work closely with our allies, and we'll continue to ask them to do more. And I'm optimistic that, over time, they'll step up to the plate.\n\nAs for post-sovereignty, I think it's too early to speculate on the exact configurations of security forces. But what I can tell you is that we're working closely with the Iraqis, with the United Nations, and with our coalition partners to make sure that the security situation in Iraq is stable.\n\nAnd, finally, I just want to say that, while I appreciate the debate, we can't let the debate divide us. We've got to be resolute in our mission, and we've got to be united in our commitment to helping the Iraqis build a better future."

We have been working closely with our allies to address the serious concerns we have about Iran's nuclear program, and we support the negotiations led by the EU-3, which includes France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. These negotiations aim to ensure that Iran complies with its international obligations and abandons its nuclear program.\n\nRegarding Iran's WTO membership, we will carefully evaluate their application and make a decision based on our country's interests. It's true that Iran's accession to the WTO could potentially provide them with greater economic benefits and integration into the global economy. However, this should not be seen as a reward for bad behavior. Iran must fulfill its international obligations, and we will not hesitate to use our veto power if their actions are deemed unacceptable.\n\nRegarding deterrence and the spread of WMDs in rogue nations, I believe it's a complex issue, and it's too early to say that our strategy has failed. We took a strong stance against Saddam Hussein's Iraq, and we demonstrated that there are consequences for pursuing WMDs. However, we must also recognize that each country has its unique circumstances, and what works in one situation might not work in another.\n\nNorth Korea, for instance, is a particularly challenging case due to its regime's history of isolation and aggressive behavior. We have been working closely with the international community, including the six-party talks, to encourage North Korea to abandon its nuclear program and participate in the global community.\n\nIran, on the other hand, is a more complex case. While we support the negotiation process, we also believe that Iran must comply with its international obligations, and we have made it clear that all options are on the table if they fail to do so.\n\nIt's also essential to note that our goal is not just to deter rogue nations from developing WMDs but also to promote a broader culture of non-proliferation and disarmament. We are working tirelessly to strengthen international institutions, such as the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and to engage the international community in our efforts to prevent the spread of WMDs.\n\nIn summary, our strategy is multifaceted, and we are working to address the unique challenges posed by rogue nations. While there is still much work to be done, I believe we are making progress, and I am confident that our efforts will ultimately contribute to a safer and more secure world."

We just need to keep pushing forward and find a way to get it across the finish line.\n\nAs for my political capital, I'd say I've still got plenty of it left.

The United States supports those efforts.\n\nNow, regarding the issue of settlements, I have made it very clear that it's in the best interest of both parties to freeze settlement activity. It's not constructive, and it's not helpful to have settlement expansion when we're trying to make progress in the peace process.\n\nHowever, I will not threaten Israel, our ally and friend, with any kind of guarantees. We're not in a position to dictate to our friends what they can or should do. What I can say is that we are working closely with both parties, with both Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas, to encourage them to make good-faith efforts to address all the core issues.\n\nThe way forward, in my view, is for both parties to take steps that demonstrate their commitment to a two-state solution, where Israel will be secure, and the Palestinian people will have a peaceful, independent homeland.\n\nRegarding settlements, I'm focused on the eventual result, which is a two-state solution where Israel is defined by its pre-'67 boundaries, with mutually agreed swaps. So, we're not focusing on just a temporary freezing or halting of settlement activity. We're looking for a comprehensive solution to this conflict.\n\nNow, let me remind you, foreign policy is complex, and it's not easy to always have immediate results.

It's essential for attracting investment, promoting stability, and creating a positive business climate. As a partner in NAFTA, Mexico's economic policies have a significant impact on the region and our bilateral trade relationship. I'm heartened by the fact that the Mexican government has committed to continuing many of the economic reforms that have helped spur growth and investment in Mexico.\n\nRegarding competitiveness with Asian countries, that's a challenge that we all face. We must recognize that the global economy is becoming increasingly interconnected, and emerging economies like China and India are playing a larger role. To stay competitive, we need to focus on increasing productivity, investing in education and innovation, and promoting trade liberalization. That's why I've called for the ratification of the Central American Free Trade Agreement and the Dominican Republic, as well as the Free Trade Agreements with other countries, like Peru and Colombia.\n\nThese agreements will help level the playing field and create new opportunities for American businesses and workers. And, as I mentioned earlier, we're working closely with our NAFTA partners to address the challenges of unfair trade practices, such as intellectual property theft and counterfeiting.\n\nOn the issue of migration, the United States and Mexico share a commitment to safe, legal, and orderly migration. We've worked together to strengthen our border security and to create new economic opportunities in Mexico that can help reduce the pressure to emigrate. I've also proposed a comprehensive immigration reform package that includes a guest worker program, which would provide more opportunities for temporary workers to come to the United States in a safe, legal manner.\n\nWe've also been in close consultations with the Mexican government on these unilateral decisions, and we'll continue to work together to address the complex issues surrounding migration."

And I'm confident that this dialogue will continue, regardless of who's in office.\n\nAs I've said before, the threat from rogue states, like North Korea and Iran, is very real, and I believe that the world deserves a collective defensive posture to deal with that threat.

We're committed to a process that leads to the transfer of wartime operational control to the Republic of Korea at the right time, and in a way that will strengthen our alliance and our ability to address the security challenges that we face.\n\nAs for meeting with President Lee and Chairman Kim, I do hope to meet with them in the future, but I don't have any immediate plans to get together with them. We will continue to work on a diplomatic track, and we are committed to the six-party talks. We believe that a peaceful resolution to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is a top priority, and we'll continue to work with all parties to achieve that goal."

The situation with Saddam Hussein and his regime is grave, and it's getting graver by the day.\n\nAs I've said before, I've been patient, and I've worked with the international community to find a peaceful resolution to this conflict. However, I've also made it clear that time is running out. The Iraqi regime has had over 12 years to comply with the United Nations' resolutions, and they have refused to do so.\n\nAs for the timeline, I'm not going to give a specific day or deadline. I think it's a mistake to do so, because it would allow Saddam Hussein to simply wait it out, and we can't afford to give him that kind of luxury.\n\nThat being said, we are looking at all options, and we are preparing for all possibilities. We have a significant military presence in the region, and we're working closely with our coalition partners to ensure that we're ready to act if necessary.\n\nRegarding a final ultimatum, I'm not opposed to giving Saddam Hussein an opportunity to disarm and comply with the UN resolutions. In fact, I've been calling on him to do so for months now. However, I'm also clear-eyed about the fact that he's had plenty of opportunities to do so, and he's chosen not to.\n\nAt this point, we need to see some concrete, tangible evidence that Saddam Hussein is serious about disarming and complying with the resolutions. Anything short of that, and I'm afraid we'll have to take a different course of action."

One of the most difficult decisions I've ever had to make as President was to send our brave men and women in uniform into combat. We based our decisions on the best intelligence available at the time, and that intelligence was provided to us by our agencies, as well as by the United Nations, and by our allies.\n\nNow, I know that there's been a lot of second-guessing about those pre-war statements, and I understand why. But let me remind you, no, we didn't just sit around speculating or concocting a scenario. We acted on what we thought was the threat to our national security, and we made the best decisions we could, based on what we knew at the time.\n\n(pausing for emphasis)\n\nNow, it's also important to note that a significant majority of Congress agreed with me when they passed the authorization for use of military force. And I think it's unfair to say that we went to war based on \"false premises\". We know Saddam Hussein had repeatedly defied UN resolutions, that he'd evicted UN inspectors in 1998. We know he had developed and used chemical and biological agents in the past. And we believed at the time that Iraq's nuclear program was advanced and could result in an unconceivable threat to our nation.\n\n(skeptically)\n\nYou know, \"hindsight\", is always 20/20, but I also want to emphasize that those critics said we'd get bogged down, that we wouldn't find support from allies or Iraqis, or that it would destabilize the region, were proved wrong.\n\n(firmly)\n\nMake no mistake, I understand this mistake weighs heavily on some Americans' hearts. But history demands this kind of decisive action, even if these tim actors continue to disagree with this initiative conclusion."

You see, the FBI, at the time, was trying to give me a sense of the scope of the threat that we faced, and I think this number was intended to convey that there were a number of leads and investigations underway.\n\nNow, if it's true that this number was exaggerated or incorrect, then I think it's a serious issue that we need to address. As the President, I rely on the information provided to me by my national security team and my law enforcement agencies to make informed decisions.\n\nI'm not saying that I was \"falsely comforted\" by the FBI, but I am saying that I want to get to the bottom of this. I want to know what happened, and I want to make sure that our intelligence and law enforcement agencies are providing accurate information to those of us who are responsible for making decisions.\n\nI'm directing my team to look into this matter further, and I want to assure the American people that we will get to the truth.

And I think they're an important part because they allow workers to own their own accounts, and to watch them grow over time. And that's attractive, I think, to a lot of Americans.\n\nNow, I also recognize that this is a complex issue, and that there's not a one-size-fits-all solution. And that's why I've asked the Social Security Commission to study all options. And I'm not afraid to consider a variety of ways to address this issue. And I think it's a good thing to raise the questions you did, and let the process proceed.\n\nNow, let me tell you this: I don't think we can grow our way out of this problem. I think we have to take a comprehensive approach. And that includes talking about all options, including the ones you mentioned. I do believe that increasing the retirement age is a reasonable consideration. I think it's something that ought to be looked at. Means testing - I'm not sure that's the right approach, but it's certainly something that we should be thinking about.\n\nBut, you see, I believe that we can't_glyph-by-stepsolve this problem without making sure that the Social Security Trust Fund's finances are strong. And that's why I also believe we need to think about some kind of cost-of-living adjustment for the trust fund.

But I do think we need to get this done. I think we need to have a bipartisan discussion. I think we need to put politics aside and focus on solving this problem. It's a problem that's been around for a while. It's time for us to address it."

I appreciate the opportunity to address this issue. \n\nFirst of all, our foreign policy is driven by a commitment to protecting America and the American people. We are dealing with different situations in different parts of the world, and each situation requires a unique approach.\n\nWhen it comes to Iraq, we faced a threat from Saddam Hussein's regime that had to be addressed through military action. Intelligence showed that he had the capability and intention to develop and use WMD's. Inaction would have been unacceptable, so we took decisive action.\n\nWith North Korea, we are taking a different approach. We are speaking to the North Koreans through diplomatic channels, including the Six-Party Talks. They have renounced their commitment to denuclearization, so we're working with our friends in China, Japan, Russia, and the Republic of Korea to try to convince the North Koreans to return to the negotiating table.\n\nWe have said consistently that our policy is not to invade Iraq and then, therefore, invade another country on suspicion. In fact, our policy is to work to create the conditions that encourage the North Koreans to do what's right and to also to help them develop a different economic policy and a different social policy.\n\nIn terms of military action, we've got the capacity to handle several conflicts at the same time. I've been assured by our military that we have the wherewithal to be able to deal with conflicts in multiple theaters.\n\nLet me be clear: our country will not teleport troops from one area and is not likely we are going to do that. We have got different- a different commitment in Afghanistan compared to Iraq. They're both important commitments, and both help us in our effort to fight the war on terror.\n\nNorth Korea is a real threat, and we are carefully and deliberately addressing that threat through diplomatic efforts and having various dialogues.\n\nNow, I want to underscore - I will do what's necessary to protect this country, and that will be after careful consideration and consultation."

And I want to assure the American people that we are going to, of course, respond vigorously if any of our troops or our agents are mistreated abroad.\n\nBut I also want to point out that our bill, the legislation that I've proposed, does very clearly state that we will not engage in cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment of detainees. And that's in line with our American values.\n\nNow, I do want to say that we will work with other countries to ensure that our folks are treated with dignity and respect, just as we expect them to treat our troops and our agents. It's a very serious matter.\n\nI'm going to go back to what I said earlier: it's very important for the Congress to help the President in making sure that we have the tools necessary to protect the American people, but also in a way that upholds our values.

We, along with our allies, have made it clear that we're willing to work with the Iranians, we're willing to negotiate, we're willing to find a peaceful resolution to this issue.\n\nBut the Iranians have got to make it clear that they're willing to abandon their nuclear ambitions. And the statement by the Iranians that they're going to continue to enrich uranium is, frankly, a non-starter. I mean, that's exactly what we're trying to prevent. We don't want a nuclear-armed Iran. The consequences of a nuclear-armed Iran would be severe.\n\nAnd so, I'm concerned, but I'm also optimistic that the international community can come together and help the Iranians understand that we're serious about this issue. And I'm also hopeful that the Iranians will take our overtures seriously and be willing to work with us.\n\nBut make no mistake, we will not back down, and we will not compromise on the basic principle that Iran should not have nuclear capabilities.

We've got a plan to achieve success in Iraq, and it involves, of course, our military presence, but also involves, and I think importantly, the training of Iraqi security forces. These Iraqi forces are getting better, they're getting more capable, and I'm convinced that, as they step up and take more and more responsibility, we'll be able to step down our presence. I don't think it's useful to set a specific timetable on troop withdrawal. It would send the wrong signal to the enemy and also to our allies.\n\nNow, about the idea that our troops may be caught in the crossfire in a civil war, I've got to say, that's not a scenario I accept. We've got to do everything in our power to help the Iraqis avoid a civil war. And I believe that with the Iraqi people's resolve, with the prime minister's plan, and with significant Iraqi security forces becoming capable, that we can avoid that kind of scenario.\n\nAs to your question about whether there will be a day with no more American forces in Iraq, I believe that's possible, but that doesn't mean it's going to happen tomorrow. It doesn't mean it's going to happen next year or the year after that. But I do believe that our goal is to make sure that Iraq is stable enough, secure enough, friendly enough, and that we've done our job well enough where it's possible for our troops to leave, for our military footprint to become smaller as the Iraqis take more and more responsibility."

I think it's a simplistic notion that says, \"Hey, just talk to 'em and maybe they'll all of a sudden see the light and start embracing Western values and stop harboring terrorists or trying to develop nuclear weapons.\" The problem with that is that hasn't worked in the past.\n\nYou know, I've had conversations with members of the G-8 countries, and we've talked about North Korea and Iran, and how to deal with them. And I've also had conversations with the leaders of those countries. And what they end up doing is, they see weakness when we negotiate with 'em.\n\nYou know, the notion that, you know, if we just sit down with Iran and talk to 'em, somehow they'll agree to no longer develop a nuclear weapon, after we've tried it the United Nations and after we've tried it through the G-5+1? I don't think so. I think it sends a signal that, you know, all these efforts of trying to manage their behavior and hold 'em to account isn't worth it. I think it sends a bad message.\n\nYou know, when you sit down with somebody like, um, you know, for instance, the President of Iran, you're dealing with a person who doesn't think like we do. You know, I mean, we have a high value for human life. They don't. And when you're sitting down with him, I think it would be very clear that the perspective on life, the values that we hold dear, are very different.\n\nI believe that to give up the United States' negotiating position and to give up the presidency's prerogative, the executive branch's prerogative to make decisions, would be disastrous.\n\nBut let me make this clear, I do believe in diplomacy. I do believe in dialogue. And I think we've used those strategies very effectively, in terms of the Middle East Peace Process, for instance."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question. Let me tell you, I'm glad you asked that. First of all, I think it's essential to put this 1% growth rate into perspective. It's not the kind of growth we're used to, and I'm not satisfied with it. However, I do think it's essential to recognize that the economy is still growing, despite the slowdown in some sectors.\n\nNow, regarding the short-term package, I understand the desire to provide relief, but I'm concerned that a short-term rebate might not have the desired effect. You see, a one-time rebate of $60 billion might give people a bit of money in their pockets, but it won't address the underlying structural issues in the economy. It won't help create jobs or stimulate investment. And that's what we need to be focusing on.\n\nNow, I'm willing to consider a short-term package, but it's got to be part of a broader effort to reform our tax code and reduce the tax burden on American families and businesses. We've got to think about the long-term health of this economy, not just the short-term fix. And I believe that my long-term tax package \u2013 which includes significant reductions in marginal tax rates, elimination of the death tax, and other pro-growth provisions \u2013 is the right way to go.\n\nSo, I'm not opposed to a short-term package in principle, but it's got to be tied to a broader effort to reform our tax code and promote long-term economic growth. And I'm willing to work with Congress to make that happen.\n\nBut let me be clear: I'm not going to sign a bill that's just a quick fix, a Band-Aid on the economy.

The first thing I want to say is that I appreciate President Putin's statement that Russia does not want Iran to have nuclear weapons. That's a statement that I'm glad to hear, and I think it's an important statement.\n\nRegarding the assurances, I think what President Putin was saying is that the Bushehr plant is a civilian-led plant, and I appreciate that clarification. The reason why I found it comforting is that he made it clear that this plant is under the IAEA safeguards, and that provides us with assurance that the plant is being used for peaceful purposes. \n\nRegarding the similarities between the Russian plant and other plants, I think it's true that Bushehr does bear some resemblance to the plants that we and others have proposed for the North Koreans. However, I think it's also important to note that the Russian situation is different, because of the civilian-led aspect of the plant. Furthermore, we're not just going to take President Putin's word for it - we're going to watch very closely to ensure that Russia is living up to its obligations.\n\nIn terms of the North Korea example, we had a specific proposal to provide a proliferation-resistant reactor design. Now I think it's worth saying that foreign assistance to Iran's nuclear program does raise concerns, and we will continue to press Russia and other countries to exercise extreme caution when dealing with the Iranian nuclear program."

It's true that it's a tough situation, and it's a situation that has been made difficult by the enemy. We're facing a brutal enemy, and they're using terror tactics to undermine the will of the Iraqi people and the will of the coalition.\n\nI would disagree, however, with the characterization that nothing is going right. There are many positive developments in Iraq, some of which get overshadowed by the spectacular attacks that the enemy is using to get our attention. And I'd like to take a moment to highlight a few of them.\n\nFirst, we have helped the Iraqi people draft a new constitution, and that's a major milestone. This constitution enshrines fundamental rights and protections for all Iraqi citizens, regardless of ethnic background or religious affiliation. And I think that's a major step towards the establishment of a stable and prosperous Iraq.\n\nSecond, we've continued to make significant progress on rebuilding the infrastructure and restoring essential services throughout Iraq. Iraq's economy is growing, and private business is expanding. And the Iraqi people are beginning to enjoy some of the benefits that come with a free and democratic society.\n\nNow, as for the Iraqi security forces, I agree that they still face significant challenges. But we believe that with continued training and equipping, they'll become a capable, professional force, fully engaged in the defense of their own country. It's going to take time and patience, but I believe we're making progress there, too.\n\nAnd, finally, regarding American public opinion, I recognize that Americans are concerned about Iraq, and they should be concerned. But I want to assure them that our commitment to Iraq's success remains unwavering. We are working diligently with our coalition partners to develop a comprehensive strategy to turn over more responsibilities to the Iraqi people, and we're committed to ensuring that the Iraqi security forces are ultimately able to take over their own security.\n\nI'd just remind everybody that this is a difficult task. We're facing a tough enemy. We're building a democracy in a part of the world that has known violence and tyranny for far too long. But we're making progress, and I'm confident that in the long term, we'll succeed in this effort."

I firmly believe that. And I think that, as time goes on, history will show that it was the right decision.\n\nNow, regarding the intelligence, I will admit that the intelligence was flawed, and that's a fact. And I've taken responsibility for it, as the President of the United States. I've acknowledged that we didn't get it right, particularly with regard to weapons of mass destruction.\n\nBut I also want to say that the intelligence community, at the time, was convinced of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein, and I was convinced of it as well. And I made the decision based on that intelligence, and I still believe that it was the right decision.\n\nNow, regarding the divisions in the country, I do think that there's a lot of passion and emotion surrounding this issue, and I respect that. I respect people's right to disagree with me, and I respect their right to question the decisions that I made.\n\nAs for what I can do about it, I think that the best thing I can do is to continue to lead, to continue to explain my decision-making process, and to continue to work towards achieving the objective that I set out to achieve in Iraq.

As Commander-in-Chief, I have a duty to make sure our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan have the resources they need to complete their mission and protect the American people. The emergency spending bill I signed provides crucial funding for our military and for vital humanitarian aid, and it's a necessary expense in these extraordinary times.\n\nNow, regarding your question about the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) fix, I believe it's responsible to protect hardworking American families from an unfair tax burden. The AMT was originally designed to ensure the wealthy pay their fair share, but it's grown to threaten millions of middle-class families. By fixing the AMT, we're allowing American families to keep more of their hard-earned income and avoid an unnecessary tax hike.\n\nAs for passing costs along to future generations, I believe our children will inherit a strong economy with low unemployment, low inflation, and a growing GDP. We're keeping taxes low to foster economic growth, and our budget is balanced on a cash basis, not using gimmicks or creative accounting. We're doing this in a way that's responsible and responsible for future generations.\n\nRegarding wasteful spending, I've tasked Director Nussle, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, to conduct a thorough review of our budget to identify areas where we can streamline, consolidate, and save taxpayer dollars. This initiative is aimed at rooting out unnecessary spending, cutting bureaucracy, and making sure that the American people get the most bang for their buck.\n\nLet me give you a hint: this initiative will involve looking at redundant programs, combining similar initiatives, and cutting waste throughout the federal government. We'll be looking for ways to improve efficiency, to streamline our operations, and make sure that your tax dollars are being spent wisely."

One of the things that we're considering is what's called \"smart sanctions,\" which would allow us to target certain sectors of the Iraqi economy that are under Saddam's control, while still allowing humanitarian assistance to reach the Iraqi people.\n\nNow, I want to assure you that we're working closely with our coalition partners, including our NATO allies, to ensure that we're on the same page. We understand that there are concerns, and we're addressing those concerns, and I believe that we can make the case that refining the sanctions will help achieve our goal, which is to pressure Saddam to comply with UN resolutions.\n\nIt's not going to be easy, but we believe that by working together, we can make progress.

The reason why some people may not see him as a threat is that they may not be aware of the magnitude of his brutality, the torture chambers, and the danger he poses to his own people and the rest of the world.\n\nWe believe that Saddam Hussein is a threat to peace, and we're working with our allies to ensure that he is disarmed. We're also working to make sure that the international community understands the threat he poses and the need for him to comply with United Nations resolutions.\n\nI understand that there may be different views on this, but I strongly believe that Saddam Hussein is a threat to peace, and we need to take action to ensure that he is disarmed and held accountable for his actions."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for that question. Let me start by saying that this is not personal. It's not about Saddam Hussein as a person, it's about the threat that his regime poses to the American people and to the world at large. The man has repeatedly threatened our country, he has invaded his neighbors, he has developed and used weapons of mass destruction in the past, and he continues to harbor and support terrorist organizations.\n\nMake no mistake, this is about the security of our country, and the security of our allies. It's not about my feelings towards Saddam Hussein; it's about my responsibility to protect the American people.\n\nNow, regarding the scenarios that my advisors have shared with me, I want to be straightforward with the American people. We're deeply concerned about the potential risks of this conflict, and we're taking those risks very seriously. We've done extensive planning and preparation to minimize the risks to American lives, but I would be less than honest if I didn't tell you that there could be some cost.\n\nAs for the worst-case scenarios, I don't think it's productive to speculate on those right now. But I want to assure the American people that we're doing everything in our power to prepare for all contingencies, to minimize the risks, and to maximize our chances of success.\n\nAnd let me be clear: we're not going into this alone. We're working closely with our international partners, including the United Nations, to build a coalition and to present a unified front against Saddam Hussein's regime.\n\nAs for the risks of retaliatory strikes here at home, we take those risks very seriously. We're working closely with our law enforcement agencies, with our intelligence agencies, and with our international partners to identify potential threats and to take proactive steps to prevent those threats from materializing.\n\nBut let me be clear: the risks of not acting, the risks of inaction, far outweigh the risks of action. We cannot allow Saddam Hussein's regime to continue to pose a threat to our country and to the world. We must act, and we will act, with the full force and determination that the American people expect of us."

We met with the Commission, and we're working to find a way to make sure that the Commission gets the information it needs to complete its work. \n\nHowever, as you know, there are certain documents that have some sensitive information in them that I am concerned could compromise our national security. I have a duty to protect those secrets. It's not a question of hiding somethin', it's a question of protectin' sensitive information that the American people do not need to know.\n\nSo, we're workin' towards findin' a solution that will allow the Commission to get the information it needs, while at the same time protectin' our national security. I'm optimistic we can find a way forward that will satisfy both the Commission and our national security requirements.\n\nNow, I must say, I'm a little concerned that the leaders of the Commission have threatened to move forward with subpoenas without exhaustin' every diplomatic avenue, and I hope we don't have to get to that point. We're better than that. We're a nation that works together, and I'm confident that we can find a solution that will satisfy everyone's concerns.\n\nNow, let me just add one thing, I also believe it's very important that the Commission understands that there's certain information that we just can't give 'em. I know there's a lot of curiosity about some parts of our national security, but we cannot give out the kind of sensitive information that could compromise our national security. I'm willing to make sure that we cooperate, but we also have to protect ourselves at the same time."

Their meddling in Iraq's internal affairs is unacceptable, and it's a major hurdle in achieving stability and security in the region. One of the key issues is the flow of foreign fighters, many of whom are coming from Syria, across the border into Iraq. They're targeting our troops, Iraqi forces, and innocent civilians, and it's undermining our efforts to bring order to the country.\n\nRegarding the interference in the political process, we're seeing evidence that both Syria and Iran are trying to influence the upcoming Iraqi elections. This could potentially undermine the democratic process and affect the legitimacy of the new Iraqi government. We're working closely with our allies and the Iraqi government to prevent such interference and ensure the election process is free and fair.\n\nNow, regarding consequences, let me be clear: we take these concerns very seriously, and we're considering a range of options to address these issues. While I won't go into specifics, rest assured that we're working to hold both Syria and Iran accountable for their actions. We'll continue to work with our international partners to increase pressure on these countries to cease their destabilizing activities.\n\nWe're also working with the Iraqi government to strengthen their capabilities to secure their borders and prevent foreign interference. We're committed to supporting the Iraqi people as they build a more stable and secure future for themselves, and we'll take action to protect our troops and interests in the region.\n\nMake no mistake, we will not tolerate foreign interference in Iraq's internal affairs, and we will take the necessary steps to address this issue."

Senator Kennedy's characterization of Iraq as a \"quagmire\" is, in my view, a mischaracterization of the situation. I believe we've made tremendous progress in Iraq, and I'm proud of the work our men and women in uniform are doing. They're doing a magnificent job under very difficult circumstances.\n\nWe've removed a brutal dictator, Saddam Hussein, from power, and we've begun the process of helping the Iraqi people to build a free, prosperous, and peaceful society. It's a tough road ahead, no question about it. But I have every confidence in the American people and the Iraqi people that we can succeed.\n\nI must say, I'm disappointed by some of the rhetoric coming out of Washington. I think it's not helpful to our troops, and it's not helpful to the Iraqi people. The message that gets sent with this kind of language, I believe, is a message of \"Don't worry about the American people being there to help you.\" And that's just not true. We've made a commitment to help Iraq become a stable, free country. And we're going to follow through on that commitment.\n\nAs for the effect on our troops' morale, I think they're pretty much focusing on the mission at hand, and that's to complete the job they've been asked to do. And I think they're proud of what they're doing. I've seen it in their eyes when I visited with them in Iraq. I've seen it in the letters they write, the emails they send, and the phone calls they make.\n\nNow, I do think we've got to watch the tone in Washington. We've got to be mindful of the language that we use. I think it's a reflection on all of our leadership, and I think it's a reflection on our nation. We can disagree without undermining the morale of our troops or the confidence of the Iraqi people. And I'm looking for a more constructive debate about the way forward in Iraq."

The United States is a country that upholds the rule of law and respects human rights. The notion that we're running some kind of gulag is absurd. We have a system in place for detaining and interrogating enemy combatants that's designed to protect American citizens and allies from terrorist attacks.\n\nWe're at war with an enemy that doesn't wear uniforms, that hides in caves, and uses civilians as shields. We're dealing with an enemy that has no respect for human life, and we have a responsibility to keep America safe.\n\nI'm not concerned about what critics say, I'm concerned about keeping America safe. And I can tell you, we're doing that. We're working with allies, we're working with international organizations to make sure that detainees are treated humanely, but also to make sure that we're able to gather intelligence to protect our country.\n\n(to leaning forward)\nAnd let me remind you, we're not just dealing with these issues in a vacuum. We're dealing with them in the context of a global war on terror. And I'm proud of the work that we're doing to disrupt and defeat al-Qaeda, to deal with the Taliban, and to bring stability to places like Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nIf we're seen as the bad guy, that's unfortunate. But if we're also seen as a country that's willing to take risks to protect its citizens, then that's a badge of honor. We're not going to let terrorist threats dictate our actions, but we're going to work with our allies to make sure that the values of human rights and dignity are upheld.\n\nNow, I know there are differences of opinion, but let me tell you, we're on the right track.

We do have information that suggests Hizballah has provided training to some of the groups, including the Mahdi Army led by Muqtada al-Sadr. Now, we can't pinpoint with absolute certainty the extent of this training, but we do have reason to believe that there has been some level of interaction.\n\nIt's worth noting that our main concern here is not just the presence of foreign actors or foreign influence in Iraq, but also the actions of these groups. When we talk about Hizballah training extremist groups, we're talking about groups that have carried out attacks on innocent civilians and coalition forces. That's unacceptable, and we will continue to work closely with our Iraqi partners to root out these extremist groups and stabilize the country.\n\nLet me be clear: we respect Iraq's sovereignty, and we agree that no outside party should interfere in the internal affairs of Iraq.

In my remaining two years, I plan to focus on promoting free trade, increasing economic opportunities, and supporting democratic institutions in the region.\n\nRegarding the issue of subsidies, I must say that I'm a strong supporter of American farmers and the agriculture sector. However, I also recognize that trade agreements require give-and-take. I've instructed my trade representatives to be open to finding common ground on this issue.\n\nPresident Lula and I did discuss this matter, and while there's no easy solution, we did agree that our trade ministers would continue to work together to find mutually beneficial solutions. I'm not prepared to make any specific commitments on reducing domestic subsidies, but I'm willing to listen to alternative proposals that could benefit both our countries.\n\nIt's worth noting that we've already taken steps to reform our farm policies, including the 2002 Farm Bill, which introduced significant changes to our agricultural subsidy programs. We're committed to continue this reform process, but any changes must be done in a way that ensures a level playing field for American farmers."

We recognize that Pakistan has legitimate security concerns, including concerns about its territorial integrity, and we're willing to work with Pakistan to address those concerns.\n\nIn terms of conventional weapons, you're right that Pakistan has concerns about its ability to match India's military capabilities. But I want to emphasize that the United States is committed to helping Pakistan strengthen its conventional defense capabilities, so it can feel more secure and less reliant on nuclear deterrence.\n\nNow, our focus is on encouraging both India and Pakistan to engage in a constructive and peaceful dialogue to resolve their differences, including on Kashmir. We believe that a peaceful resolution to this conflict is the best way to address the underlying security concerns of both countries.\n\nAnd let me be clear: we're not asking Pakistan to give up its nuclear program unilaterally. We're urging both India and Pakistan to work together with the international community to reduce the risks associated with their nuclear programs, and to move towards a more stable and secure region.\n\nSo, in short, we're committed to working with Pakistan to address its security concerns, and we believe that a stable and secure Pakistan is essential to the stability of the entire region."

We've seen some progress, but it's not happening at the pace we'd like to see.\n\nAs for how long we'll wait, I'm not setting a specific timeline, but I will say that I'm deeply concerned about the stalemate in Baghdad. I've made it clear to the Iraqi government that we need to see more progress on reconciliation, on the oil law, on de-Baathification, and on other key issues.\n\nWe're working closely with the Iraqi government to help them build their capacity, but at the end of the day, they've got to make the tough decisions.

We've made a commitment to the American people, to the Iraqi people, and to the troops who are fighting for freedom and democracy.

First, let me say that I'm a strong believer in the transatlantic relationship, and I believe it's in the interests of the American people for us to work closely with our friends in Europe. We've had some discussions today about deepening our cooperation in areas such as counter-terrorism, proliferating technologies, the Middle East peace process, and the Balkans.\n\nThere are areas where we agree, and there are areas where we don't agree. And I think it's healthy that we don't agree on everything. The Europeans have some concerns about our missile defense systems, and I understand that. But I've made it clear to our friends that our intentions are good, and we're not trying to create a defense system that would be a threat to Europe.\n\nNow, on the Kyoto protocol, I want to say that we share the concern about global warming. We want to find a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Kyoto protocol, in my judgment, is a flawed document that won't accomplish what we want to accomplish. That being said, I have instructed our negotiators to be open to new ideas and to research. And if there's a way to modify the Kyoto protocol in a way that makes sense for us, we'll take a look at it.\n\nBut let me make it clear: we're not going to ratify a treaty that will damage our economy or hinder our economic growth. We must be good stewards of the environment, but we also must be good stewards of our economy."

I've worked with the OPEC nations to try to get them to increase their production, and some of them have done so. But I think it's also important to note that we've had some disruptions in the world oil market that have affected the price.\n\nIn terms of refining capacity, that's a issue we're working on. The EPA's regulation on MTBE is going to be relaxed, so that we can, in fact, produce more gasoline. And today, I announced that we're going to streamline the regulatory process for the construction of new refineries.\n\nNow, I know that might not sound like much, but it's a step in the right direction. And I'm a believer that if we can get a new refinery built, it'll show the market that we're serious about increasing capacity. So we're also going to work with Congress to pass an energy bill that will, among other things, provide incentives for new refinery construction.\n\nNow, it's a tough issue, and it's not something you can just snap your fingers and wish it away. But I'm committed to working on it. And I'm optimistic that we can get the price down, or at least stabilize it. The American people deserve no less."

We've had productive discussions, and our agreement on biofuels is a great step forward for both our countries.\n\nNow, regarding the other fellow you mentioned, I think it's clear that there's a divide in this hemisphere between those who want to have a positive, constructive relationship with the United States and those who are promoting a different kind of approach. And let me tell you, the American people are not interested in a situation where there's a self-appointed leader in the region who is trying to undermine the good work that we're doing.\n\nI think that our approach, based on trade, based on democracy, based on human rights, based on values that are not only American values, but universal values, stands in stark contrast to the kind of approach that we see being promoted by that other fellow. I believe that, over time, the people of this hemisphere will determine that the kind of approach that we're promoting is the right approach for the future.\n\nRegarding ethanol, we had a very productive discussion on this subject. The United States is committed to using more ethanol as part of our strategy to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. President Lula da Silva and I agree that we need to work together to make sure that we're using this commodity in a way that benefits both our countries.\n\nAs for the tariffs issue, I think it's fair to say that we've made some progress on that front. The USA is willing to take a look at the tariffs that are in place and see what we can do to make sure that we're promoting a greater trade environment for ethanol. But the issue is, of course, complex. We've got interests that we've got to balance here, but I'm confident that we can work through this and find a solution that satisfies the legitimate interests of both our countries."

But I would remind them that in the Security Council, we've passed Resolution 1441, which called for Iraq to disarm. And as it stands today, Iraq is still not in compliance with that resolution.\n\nAs for the notion that the United States is seen as an arrogant power, I would say that I don't think that's a fair characterization. I believe the United States is a nation that is committed to spreading freedom and protecting our interests, and I'm proud of that.\n\nWe are a nation that is concerned about the suffering of the Iraqi people under Saddam's regime.

And I will tell you, Prime Minister Maliki is a good man with a big vision. He's under a lot of pressure, no question about it. But he's also made some tough decisions and worked hard to move the process forward.\n\nI think it's fair to say that the Iraqis are making progress, albeit not nearly as quickly as any of us would like. But we can't confuse setbacks with a lack of progress. We're in this for the long haul. We're in this to make sure that the Iraqi government is able to sustain, govern, and secure itself, and it's going to take some time.\n\nNow, Prime Minister Maliki has assured me that he's committed to a multi-ethnic Iraq. He's shown a willingness to take on some tough tasks, like going after the death squads and other violent groups. And we're working closely with him to ensure that these goals are met.\n\nNow, I want to assure the American people that we're not going to leave Iraq until the job is done. And when we leave, we'll leave behind a government that can function and a security force that can defend itself.\n\nIt's not a question of doubt, but rather a question of whether or not we can do this, whether we can make a difference in this part of the world. And I believe with every fiber of my being that we can, and we will.\n\nI think it's also fair to say that we've come a long way since the spring and the amount of violence this summer. Although it's still high, I believe that there's been improvement, particularly in the areas where the Iraqis are moving forward with the help of coalition forces.\n\nNow, look, I'm under no illusions about the difficulties that remain, and we're going to be patient, we're going to be persistent, and we'll go on till we get the job done. But we've got to stay the course, I firmly believe."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question. I'm glad to have a chance to address this. I do believe that a vote of disapproval can embolden the enemy. When we're in a difficult fight like we are in Iraq, our troops deserve a united America and a message of support. And I think when there's a vote of disapproval, it can have the effect of emboldening our enemies, which would be unfortunate.\n\nNow, I understand that there's disagreement on how to proceed in Iraq, and I respect that. But I believe that we've got a good strategy in place, and that's a strategy of working with the Iraqi government to help them secure themselves, and training Iraqi troops, and eventually having them take the lead in securing their country. And I think it's very important for our enemies to know that we're committed to this effort.\n\nNow, in terms of the appropriation, I'm working the phones pretty hard to persuade members of Congress to make sure that our troops get the resources they need to do their job. And I'm optimistic that, in the end, Congress will come together and provide the necessary funds. We're not asking for a blank check; we're asking for the necessary funds to support our troops in a time of war.\n\nAnd let me just say that, you know, I'm a bit frustrated that we're having to debate this at all. Our troops are fighting a ruthless enemy, and they deserve the support of the American people. And I'm going to keep working to make sure that we don't tie the hands of our commanders in the field, and that we give them the resources they need to succeed."

    "gen_response": "I understand the skepticism, and I appreciate it, because it's healthy to have a skeptical press. But I want to remind you, the intelligence community has genuine concerns, based on the information they had at the time, about Saddam Hussein's intentions, as it relates to having a nuclear program. And while it's true that no stockpiles have been found, the fact is, the culture of that regime, the intentions of that regime, were clear.\n\nRegarding Iran, I've made it clear to the Iranian people that we're concerned about their intentions. We've seen their bombast - excuse me, their ballistic missile program, which is a threat to the region, as well as their declarations about wanting to build a bomb.\n\nI don't think I was hyping the danger when it comes to Iran. I was informing the American people of the concerns that we have. And we'll continue to work to make sure that the international community comes together to address the problems posed by the Iranian regime.\n\nAs for credibility, I think our credibility is based on the fact that we've seen the threat of a nuclear terrorism, and we've seen it, over and over again. We saw it in Afghanistan, with the Taliban harboring al-Qaeda. We saw it with the missiles in Afghanistan and in Pakistan. And we've seen it in Iraq, with the connections to terrorist states and terrorist organizations.\n\nLet me make it clear, the threat of a nuclear arms program, and the ability of a state sponsor of terror to achieve a nuclear capability, is a real and present danger to the region and to the world. We are working hard, and I believe in close partnership with the international community, to try to deal with it in the most constructive way possible."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for your question. Let me address both parts. Firstly, on the issue of troop levels, I'd like to emphasize that our policy is tried and true. We're a nation of flexible, adapting to the situation on the ground. Our generals are doing a fantastic job. We're adjusting our strategy, of course. Clearly, we must ensure we have sufficient troop levels in both theaters of operation. We are reviewing and reevaluating our troop deployments, as is prudent and wise. And you'll see us responding to those needs.\n\nOn the second part of your question, I strongly disagree with the characterization of our strategy in Iraq. The reality on the ground, as is often talked about, belies that notion. Iraq has been and is a central battlefront in the global war on terror. Al-Qaeda made the decision to consider Iraq a battlefield; we followed suit and took the fight to them. As we've made gains in Iraq that's spilled over, positively, into that region and the Central Command \u2013 Afghanistan and more areas are drawn into it. So, I think it's very important and beneficial for our country to confront al-Qaeda, and we will."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for your question. Well, I'll tell you, we're working hard to get the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441 implemented, which calls for Saddam Hussein to disarm. We've made it clear to Saddam that this is a serious resolution and he must take immediate steps to comply. I believe the inspectors will know in a relatively short period of time whether or not he's intending to comply. We'll see signs, for example, of whether he's allowing inspectors unrestricted access, whether he's providing information about his programs and facilities.\n\nI wouldn't dream of trying to guess the exact timeline, but I would say within the next few weeks we'll have a pretty good idea of whether he's going to comply or not. The inspectors will report back, and if Saddam Hussein isn't complying, we'll take that into account and consider further action.\n\nMake no mistake about it: we expect him to comply fully and immediately. And if he doesn't, the consequences will be serious. But we'll work with the international community to make sure that we exhaust all diplomatic options before we consider taking any further action.\n\nSo I think it's going to be a shorter period of time, rather than a longer period of time, before we know whether or not Saddam Hussein intends to comply with the will of the world."

    "gen_response": "(frowning) Well, I appreciate the question, but I must say, I strongly disagree with the premise. Our policy towards France has been one of cooperation and mutual respect, despite our differences on certain issues. Now, I know there have been some disagreements on Iraq, and perhaps that's what you're referring to. But let me be clear: we value our relationship with France and the French people, and we will continue to work with them on a wide range of issues, from counter-terrorism to trade.\n\nRegarding the second part of your question, I want to be very clear: the actions of a few individuals at Abu Ghraib do not represent the values or the policies of the United States government. We took swift and decisive action to address those abuses, and we've held those responsible accountable. We will not be swayed by unfair comparisons to Saddam Hussein or any other dictator. We are a nation of laws, and we will uphold those laws and our values, even in the face of adversity.\n\nAs for the issue of state terrorism, I reject that label outright. We are a nation that respects human rights and the rule of law, and we will not engage in actions that undermine those principles. And as for the weapons of mass destruction, while we may not have found the stockpiles we expected, intelligence agencies around the world, including the French intelligence agencies, agreed that Saddam Hussein posed a threat to international security. We acted on the best intelligence available at the time, and we will continue to work to prevent the proliferation of WMD.\n\n(leaning forward)\nNow, I understand that there are those who will continue to question our actions and our policies. But I can tell you that our commitment to protecting the American people, and to upholding our values, will not waver. We will continue to work with our allies, including France, to build a safer and more secure world for all."

    "gen_response": "That's a great question. I appreciate you bringing it up. First of all, let me just remind people that our strategy for victory in Iraq is to help the Iraqis take the lead, to train the Iraqis, to get them to a position where they can provide their own security. And that's happening. The troop levels will be determined by the generals on the ground, not by some arbitrary number decided by politicians in Washington.\n\nNow, in terms of our ability to respond to other threats, I would say that our military, because of its flexibility and because of its strength, is capable of responding to threats from around the world. That's why we are calling it the expeditionary force, not for a specific place. I mean, we are going to respond to threats when they come.\n\nNow, I think we are in a delicate phase of diplomacy right now with North Korea, and we are optimistic that through the six-party talks, that North Korea will agree to dismantle its nuclear programs. I think that our diplomatic pressure is being effective in convincing them that it's in their best interest to be a part of the international community, rather than to try to isolate themselves.\n\nNow, I think our troop levels will be determined by the job on the ground, not by perceived threats from around the world. We will not cut and run based on hypotheticals. This nation will respond to threats, no matter where they are, if they are directed at our interest."

I want to thank Mr. Sharon for his bold move to disengage from Gaza. I think it's a historic moment. And I think it's going to be an opportunity for the Palestinians to show the world they can govern themselves.\n\nRegarding the issue of airspace and control of ports, we're working closely with the Israelis, the Palestinians, and other parties to ensure that there's a coordinated approach to these issues. My administration's position is clear: we want to see the Palestinians having control of their territory, and we want to see the Israelis feeling secure. And we're working to find a way to make that happen.\n\nNow, I want to emphasize that the roadmap is a process, and we're not there yet. We've got a lot of work ahead of us. But I'm optimistic. I believe that with strong leadership and a commitment to peace, we can get there. And I think the disengagement from Gaza is a great first step.\n\nAnd I must say, I'm heartened by President Abbas's commitment to democracy. It's a reminder that peace is not just between governments, but between peoples. And I'm committed to helping the Palestinian people achieve their aspirations for freedom and democracy.\n\nNow, I know there's a lot of skepticism out there, but I'm an optimist. I believe that with perseverance, with good faith, and with a commitment to peace, we can achieve great things. And I think this is a moment of hope for the Palestinian people, and I'm committed to seeing this process through."

Secretary Powell is going to the Middle East to, of course, visit with our friends and discuss a range of issues, and one of the issues he will discuss is the sanctions and how to make them more effective. The message he will take is that we're committed to containing Saddam Hussein, we're committed to making sure he doesn't threaten his neighbors, and at the same time we're committed to relieving the suffering of the Iraqi people.\n\nWe believe that the sanctions must be focused on Saddam Hussein and his regime, not on the Iraqi people. And we're working to find ways to make the sanctions more effective in this regard. And I think you'll see, over time, that we'll continue to refine our policy to make sure that we're able to pressure Saddam Hussein without hurting the Iraqi people.\n\nWe've made significant progress in the oil-for-food program, and we're continuing to work with the international community to make sure that the program is implemented effectively, and that the Iraqi people receive the food and medicine they need.\n\nSo, Secretary Powell will go, as I said, with a message of hope, a message of cooperation, and a message that we're committed to relieving the suffering of the Iraqi people, but also to making sure that Saddam Hussein doesn't threaten the neighborhood."

As I've said before, I've always been a strong supporter of the sanctity of human life, and I share the Pope's concerns about the manipulation of embryos.\n\nRegarding federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, I've made my position clear: while I support research that could lead to improved medical treatments and cures, I am opposed to using taxpayer money to fund research that involves the destruction of human embryos. I will continue to take the Holy Father's words into consideration, as well as the views of other leaders and the American people, as I examine this decision.\n\nI will re-evaluate my position in light of the Pope's declaration, and I will work with our scientific advisors and ethicists to ensure that our policies are informed by both the latest scientific advancements and a deep respect for human life.\n\nAnd now, I'll turn this question over to Prime Minister Berlusconi to address the second part of your question. Prime Minister?\n\nAnd if I may add, I believe Italy has a unique role to play in our bilateral relationship, as well as in Europe. Italy is an important partner and ally in the war on terror, and we've had a long history of cooperation on defense and security issues. Italy has also been a key player in promoting democracy and stability in the Mediterranean region.\n\nI think our relationship with Italy is strong and multifaceted, and it goes beyond our shared membership in NATO and other international organizations. We work together on a range of issues, from counter-terrorism to non-proliferation, and we value Italy's role as a leader in European affairs. Prime Minister?"

We're working closely with our coalition partners, the United Nations, and other international organizations to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches those in need.\n\nIn the next several days, we will be working to establish a secure environment in Kabul, which will enable us to deliver assistance to the Afghan people. We're also working with the international community to establish a conference, a meeting, to bring together the various parties, including the Northern Alliance, to discuss the future of Afghanistan.\n\nRegarding the Northern Alliance, they have played a crucial role in the fight against the Taliban and al-Qaeda. As we move forward, we're interested in seeing a government that is representative of all the people of Afghanistan, not just one group or another. The Northern Alliance, like other factions, will certainly have a seat at the table, but we will not be favoring one group over another.\n\nOur goal is to help the Afghan people build a representative government, and we're committed to making sure that the rights of all Afghans, regardless of their ethnic background or regional affiliation, are respected and protected. We will be working with the United Nations, with other countries, to ensure that a broad-based government is established, one that represents the will of the Afghan people.\n\nWe've made some progress, but there's still a lot of work to be done.

However, I also want to make it clear that our aid is not a blank check. We expect our friends to work with us towards a peaceful resolution to the conflict, and to respect the principles of peace and non-violence.\n\nAs for consequences, I want to say that we will continue to work closely with both sides to encourage them to comply with our expectations. We will also continue to hold them accountable for their actions, and we will make our views clear to the international community.\n\nNow, I'm not going to rule out any options at this point, including re-evaluating our aid packages.

I've told Chairman Arafat that in no uncertain terms, and I will continue to speak truth to power on this issue.\n\nFinally, I want to emphasize that as the President of the United States, I will not be swayed by personal attacks or inflammatory rhetoric.

The evidence that we've gathered points to the fact that Saddam Hussein is reconstituting his nuclear program. He is in violation of 17 United Nations Security Council resolutions calling upon him to disarm. He has the capacity to make biological and chemical agents.\n\nNow, I understand that I haven't made it clear enough, perhaps, to some, but I think the American people understand that Saddam Hussein has proven himself to be bad news, and that our diplomacy efforts have failed, unfortunately, over the course of the last 12 years.\n\nNow, I'd like to add, the reason I believe we have to take this course of action is because we can't have diplomacy without the threat of force behind it. And I believe that now is the time to disarm Saddam Hussein, rather than to wait until he decides to unleash a threat against the United States or against our friends and allies.\n\nI understand the doubts and the worries, but I'm resolute in my commitment to keep America secure and to disarm Saddam Hussein."

We've had a remarkable recovery from the recession, and we're growing at a good clip.\n\nHowever, I also recognize that some folks are struggling to adapt to this new economy. That's why we've been working on a comprehensive strategy to help Americans acquire the skills they need to compete in this global economy.\n\nOne of the initiatives I'm proud of is our commitment to improving education and job training. We've increased funding for programs like the Workforce Investment Act, which helps people get the skills they need to fill the jobs that are available.\n\nWe've also launched a major initiative to improve math and science education, because those are the skills that are going to be in high demand in the 21st century.\n\nAnd let me tell you, we're also working on a new program called \"TechSkills,\" which is a program to help workers upgrade their skills in technology.\n\nNow, I know that some folks are concerned that jobs are being outsourced, and I understand that concern. But the truth is, the American economy is still creating jobs. We've added 4.6 million jobs over the past three years, and many of those jobs are in sectors that didn't even exist 10 years ago.\n\nBut we can do more, and we will do more.

We want to make sure that our seniors have a safety net, a floor of protection, that they can rely on. And so, while the details are still being worked out, I am open to the idea of providing a guaranteed benefit for those who opt into personal accounts.\n\nI think it's essential to remember, however, that the personal accounts are meant to provide a measure of personal ownership and control for each individual. We want people to have a stake in our economic growth, and to benefit from the fruits of their labor. So, we're gonna work on the details to find the right balance, but I am open to considering a guaranteed benefit as part of that overall package.\n\nNow, to my fellow Republicans who are worried, I say: let's have an open and honest dialogue about this issue.

The election results send a clear message that the American people are eager for a new direction on Iraq.\n\nAs Commander-in-Chief, I have a responsibility to ensure the safety and security of our troops and the American people. The Vice President's comments were a reflection of our commitment to the mission in Iraq, but also an acknowledgment that we are always looking for ways to improve and adjust our strategy.\n\nA \"course correction\" means that we will continue to work with the Iraqis, our coalition partners, and our military leaders to find new and effective ways to achieve our goals in Iraq. It means that we will be flexible, and we will adapt to changing circumstances on the ground.\n\nIt's not about moving full speed ahead without adjusting to the realities on the ground. It's about making sure that we're doing everything we can to succeed in Iraq, and that we're using all the tools and resources at our disposal to support our troops and the Iraqi people.\n\nI appreciate the advice and the input of the Vice President, but ultimately, as the Commander-in-Chief, I make the decisions, and I will continue to do what I think is in the best interest of our country."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question. I understand the concern about the Iraqi government's ability to assume responsibility for their own security. And I understand the suggestion that a gradual withdrawal might be a way to address this concern.\n\nHowever, I must remind you that the situation on the ground is complex. Our military leaders tell me that a premature withdrawal would embolden the enemy, Al Qaida, and other extremist groups that are trying to destabilize the Iraqi government.\n\nNow, we are making progress in Iraq. We're working with the Iraqi government, with the military, to build up their capacity to provide security for their own people. And that's an important mission. The Iraqis are beginning to take more and more responsibility.\n\nBut a timed withdrawal, or a withdrawal tied to an arbitrary deadline, would signal to the enemy that we're getting ready to leave. And I'm not going to send a signal to the enemy that we're going to abandon the Iraqi government or the Iraqi people.\n\nWe have to be careful in our approach, because any signal we send will be interpreted not just by our friends, but by our enemies as well. So, while I understand the concern, I'm not convinced that a gradual withdrawal is the way to go right now.\n\nWe've got to work on building up the Iraqi capacity, we've got to work on showing the enemy that we're committed to the mission, and we've got to give the Iraqis a chance to succeed.\n\nThat's my assessment, after listening to the military leaders, that a gradual withdrawal at this point would not be a good idea."

Now, I understand that the visit to Iran may have raised some eyebrows, and I'll tell you why. We've had our differences with the Iranians, as you well know. Their development of nuclear arms is a grave concern, not just for the United States, but the entire international community.\n\nHowever, we also believe that Prime Minister Maliki's efforts to engage with the Iranians can be a positive step towards resolving the regional issues that affect Iraq. Now, our policy on Iran remains firm: we expect them to comply with the United Nations resolutions and suspend their enrichment activities.\n\nAs for the images from the visit, I think it's natural that the Prime Minister would meet with his counterparts in the region. What's important to us is that Iraq remains a key partner in the war on terror and a staunch supporter of our efforts to bring stability to the region.\n\nIn terms of a message, I believe it sends a signal that Iraq is willing to engage with its neighbors, and that's a positive development. However, we expect the Prime Minister to remain committed to the values that we've worked hard to promote in Iraq, including democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.\n\nLet me be clear, though: our relationship with Iraq is built on shared interests and shared values. And while we acknowledge the importance of engagement with Iran, our policy towards the Iranian government remains unchanged. We will continue to work with our allies in the region to see the region become more secure and more prosperous, and to counter the destabilizing actions of the Iranian regime.\n\nNow, next question, please."

But I also understand that there's more work to be done. \n\nOne issue that's still on my radar screen is the confirmation of qualified judges who will uphold the Constitution and the values that we hold dear. We've had some success in the Senate, but there's still more to be done.  Another issue is the reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act, which has provisions to support the work of faith-based organizations in helping disadvantaged children.\n\nNow, I think it's fair for the folks to expect results, and I'm committed to working with them to get those results.

The Taliban, which provided haven to Al Qaida, is no longer in power. That's a significant achievement. The borders of Afghanistan are no longer leaky now, unlike they were prior to our involvement. And there's a lot of cooperation around the world.\n\nNow, to answer your specific questions about Usama bin Laden, I don't have information that confirms his death, and I don't have information that confirms he's alive. We just don't know. We've made efforts to find him. We've spent a lot of manpower and resources to find him, as well as to find other Al Qaida leaders.\n\nAl Qaida is still a viable organization, but its ability to operate has been severely impaired. They don't have the same kind of haven they had prior to our operations. We've rounded up or killed a lot of the top Al Qaida leaders. The network has been severely damaged.\n\nNow, as for cells within the United States, I do know that there's a concern that there may still be people here that we don't know about yet who would kill an American if they could. But we've got a good counterterrorism team, and we're working hard to find those who would do us harm.\n\nBut let me put it to you this way: We are safer today than we were prior to 9/11. We're safer today because of the hard work of the FBI, CIA, Department of Homeland Security, and the military. But I also understand it's a complex world we live in, and that there's still threats to America.\n\nI want to reassure the American people that we're working hard, that we're making progress, and that we will continue to do everything in our power to protect this nation and our friends."

I want to assure the American people that when I made the decision to go into Iraq, I was deeply concerned about the existence of weapons of mass destruction. There's no doubt that Saddam Hussein had a history of aggression and deception. He had used chemical weapons against his own people, and we knew he had the capability to produce more.\n\nOver the past 15 months, we've had a team of inspectors from the Iraq Survey Group, led by Charles Duelfer, and they've done a good job of trying to determine what happened to those weapons. Based on their findings, we now know that while Saddam Hussein had a program in place to develop and maintain chemical and biological capabilities, the weapons themselves were not found in the quantities that we thought.\n\nIt's still unclear exactly what happened to those capabilities. David Kay, the former head of the Iraq Survey Group, has said that it's possible that some weapons were moved, but I want to assure the American people that we're doing everything we can to find out exactly what happened.\n\nNow, I've shared this information with my G-8 partners, and I believe that we all agree that we need to continue to support the Iraqi people in their efforts to build a democratic government and a free and prosperous society. The main reason I went into Iraq was to protect the American people and our allies from the threat posed by Saddam Hussein, and I believe that we've accomplished that goal.\n\nBut I want to assure you, I still have questions, and I'm not satisfied with where we are on this issue. I'm committed to getting to the bottom of it, and we will continue to work with the Iraqis, with our allies, and with the international community to find out what happened to those capabilities."

We're a nation of laws, and we need to uphold those laws.\n\nAt the same time, I also understand the concerns of many Americans who are frustrated with the current state of our immigration system. We need to work towards comprehensive immigration reform that secures our borders, provides a pathway to citizenship for those who are here, and addresses the root causes of migration.\n\nBut we can't let our desire for security and control lead us to abandon our values of compassion and justice. We're a nation of immigrants, and we need to treat all people with dignity and respect.

It's a difficult process. But I also know that leadership requires patience and persistence. We're making progress, steady progress. We've got a framework, a foundation, a set of principles that have been set forth in resolution 1559. And we're building on that with this new resolution.\n\nI think it's essential for the American people to understand that diplomacy is not just about signing a piece of paper and declaring victory. Diplomacy is about making incremental progress toward a goal, and pushing parties to move towards that goal.\n\nNow, I know some might say, \"Is it going to take another resolution, and another resolution, and another?\" And the answer is, I hope not. I hope that we can get this done quickly. But we're not going to sacrifice the goal of a sustainable peace for the sake of expediency.

First of all, I want to remind people that the reason the international community came together to support a U.N. resolution was because we were concerned about the violence in the region. And the U.N. resolution was a necessary step, in our judgment, to create a framework for a lasting peace. Now, I understand the Lebanese Prime Minister's frustrations. The Prime Minister's frustrations, I think, reflect the frustration of a lot of people who want to get on with rebuilding their country. And I share that frustration.\n\nBut the idea of this U.N. resolution was to create a framework, and then take it to the international community to support and help Lebanon and Israel deal with the problem of Hezbollah's influence in southern Lebanon. And the fact that there have been some incidents does not, in my judgment, undermine the international effort. It simply means that we've got to work harder to make sure that everybody is on the same page.\n\nNow, regarding the forces that are going to be deployed, I think it's very important for people to understand that the forces are going to be led by the international community, they're going to be made up of, primarily, European and Muslim nations, and they will be working very closely with the Lebanese army. Now, it's going to take some time to get the international force on the ground, and it's going to take some time for the Lebanese government to deploy their army throughout the country.\n\nBut I believe we're making progress. I believe that we're on the right track. I believe that we're creating a framework for peace. And I believe that, eventually, we'll have a lasting peace in the region.\n\nIt's going to be difficult, there are going to be ups and downs, but I'm committed to this. I'm committed to the international effort. And I'm committed to supporting the Lebanese government and the Israeli government as they work through the difficulties in the region.\n\nIt's not just a piece of paper. It's a framework that says to the world, we want peace. We want people to be able to live in peace. We want children to be able to go to school and play without fear of violence. And I believe that's what the U.N. resolution is all about. So I remain optimistic, but I also remain realistic. I understand that there's still a lot of work to be done."

Saddam Hussein's regime is a threat not just to the region but to the world.\n\nWe've made it clear that we're not just going into Iraq to change the regime, we're going after a threat.

In the wake of the great financial responsibility that our great nation shoulders as the leader of free market economics, the United States is always willing to lend an ear to countries in financial turmoil, not merely for their sake, but also in our own interests for promoting market stability.\n\nThat being said, Argentina presents a different scenario. The peso-dollar par and the declining value of the peso has raised concerns of market crash and floundering consumer and investor confidence. Our officials at the Department of the Treasury headed by Secretary O'Neill have been working closely with the Argentine government on a solution.\n\nAs to what action to take, we are considering multiple possible formulas to forestall a full blown credit crisis. In Mexico's case - in '95-'  a U.S. backed pursuit bond program, risk safeguards for intended International Monetary Fund (IMF) replenishment was proposed and Argentina would need to reform and rectify their financial sectors to qualify for any unguaranteed protection from Washington and the funds.\n\nFinancial vulnerability mostly drives a nation's essential strategies in all this, of this I am certain. This might not be the only available formula - include support from international bodies and ultimately - the real question is whether the caretaker  has ensued to scratch beyond the symptoms to real internal economic reform."

We've made good progress in the House, but we're facing some obstacles in the Senate. And I'm working hard, behind the scenes, to build support for this bill. I'm meeting with key lawmakers, I'm making phone calls, and I'm urging those who are hesitant to come on board.\n\nNow, I know some folks may say, \"Well, you're not out there beating the bushes, giving speeches, and mobilizing the base like you do on other issues.\" And that's a fair point. But let me tell you, this is a delicate negotiation, and it requires a certain amount of finesse. We're trying to build a coalition, we're trying to find common ground, and we're trying to get a bill that will actually make a difference.\n\nI will say this: I'm not going to give up on this issue. I'm going to keep pushing, I'm going to keep prodding, and I'm going to keep working until we get a bill that's worthy of the name \"intelligence reform.\" And if that takes a little bit longer than some folks might like, so be it. This is too important to rush.\n\nAs for my relationship with members of my own party, let me tell you, I've got a good working relationship with many of them. And I'm not afraid to challenge them when I think it's necessary. But at the end of the day, I'm also a uniter, not a divider. And I'm going to work with those folks, even when we disagree, to find common ground and get the job done. Thank you."

We have intelligence assets and dedicated personnel working around the clock to track him down and bring him to account for his heinous crimes. While I do not have specific information on his whereabouts that I can share with you today, I can tell you that we are following every lead, every tip, and every shred of evidence to bring him to justice. We are working closely with our allies and partners in the region to ensure that we leave no stone unturned in this pursuit.\n\nRegarding the detainees at Guantanamo, I understand the concerns about the status of these individuals and the delays in bringing them to trial. Let me be clear: the United States stands for the rule of law, and we are committed to treating all individuals, including detainees, with dignity and respect.\n\nHowever, we are also dealing with a unique and difficult situation, where we have individuals who have been captured on the battlefield, many of whom are hardened terrorists who would stop at nothing to harm innocent lives. We have to balance our commitment to justice with our duty to protect the American people.\n\nI want to assure you that we are working hard to establish a fair and just process for trying these detainees, one that balances our security concerns with our commitment to human rights. And I've called for the development of a system that would allow us to prosecute these individuals in a fair and expeditious manner, while also protecting the sensitive intelligence information that we gather.\n\nWe are actively engaged in discussions with the Congress on this issue, and we are committed to finding a solution that upholds the values that America represents, while also protecting the safety and security of the American people.\n\nAnd I would add that our actions have been guided by the advice of the Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense, as well as the Department of State, to ensure that we are meeting our international obligations and upholding American values.\n\nAnd I'd like to add, that, the criticisms of Guantanamo, I understand, but we've also saved lives. We've also prevented attacks, and we will continue to work hard to defend our nation and defend our values."

We've reformed our tax code, making it more fair and pro-growth. We've protected America's national security through the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, and we've worked to support the spread of freedom and democracy around the world. I believe these are all lasting legacies that we're gonna be proud of.\n\nNow, regarding your second question, (pauses) I'm not concerned about my role changing, I'm not worried about who's going to control the agenda. My focus is on continuing to lead this country for the next 16 months, and I intend to keep pushing my agenda forward, whether it's on energy, climate change, immigration, or healthcare.\n\nNow, I know there are gonna be challenges ahead, especially with Democrats in control of Congress, but I've always said that I'm a results-oriented fella. I want to get things done for the American people, so I'll be working with the Congress to try to find common ground, where we can, and I'll keep pushing for my priorities where we can't.\n\nYou know, I've always said that I'm the decider, and I'll continue to decide what's in the best interest of this great country of ours.

Let me tell you, the situation in Iraq is a complex one, and it's a tough environment. Our commander, General (Peter) Pace, and I are on the same page. We understand that the Iraqi forces are making progress, but they still need our support and training. And let me tell you, we're committed to seeing this through to victory.\n\nNow, as for passing on the fate of the war to the next President, I don't think that's the right way to put it. The American people expect us to see this mission through, to make sure that Iraq is a stable, free, and secure country. And that's exactly what we're gonna do. We're gonna continue to work with the Iraqi government, with the international community, to make sure that we achieve our objectives.\n\nAnd to the Prime Minister's question, I think we've learned some valuable lessons from our experience in Iraq. One of the biggest mistakes, I think, was underestimating the extent of the insurgent threat, and the ways in which they would exploit the situation. But I think we've made adjustments to that, we've come up with a new strategy, with the surge, and it's showing real signs of success. We're also working hard to build up the Iraqi economy, to give people alternatives to the insurgency.\n\n(The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, steps forward)\n\nTony Blair: (in a British accent) Thank you, Mr. President. I think one of the biggest mistakes was not having a proper strategy for post-conflict reconstruction. We were focused on the military effort, which was necessary, but we didn't have a clear enough plan for what came next. And that meant that the vacuum was filled by some of the extremist forces that we're now fighting.\n\nAs for what we propose to do, I think we need to redouble our efforts on the civilian side, working with the Iraqi government to build up the institutions of state, to get the economy going, to improve the humanitarian situation. We also need to continue to support the Iraqi forces, to help them to build the capability they need to take on the insurgents. And we need to work more closely with the international community, to bring in other countries, and to get their help and support for the Iraqi people.\n\nI think if we can do that, we can make real progress, we can start to see the end of the tunnel, and we can bring our troops home with a sense of pride and accomplishment."

I'm proud to say that we've made some progress on this front, and I want to thank the President and the people of Benin for their leadership on this issue.\n\nAs you know, the subsidies that the United States provides to our farmers can have a negative impact on cotton producers in countries like Benin. And I understand the importance of cotton to the Beninese economy, so we've been working to address this issue.\n\nWe've made some changes to our farm bill to reduce the impact of our subsidies on cotton producers around the world. And I'm also proud to say that we've increased our support for the Cotton Sector Improvement Program, which provides assistance to cotton producers in Benin and other West African countries.\n\nHowever, I will also be the first to say that there's still more work to be done. The issue of cotton is still a sensitive issue, and we need to continue to work together to find a solution that's fair to all parties involved.\n\nI'm committed to continuing to work on this issue, and I look forward to continuing our dialogue with the government of Benin and other interested parties to find a solution that benefits cotton producers in Benin and around the world."

We've kept the country safe, and the economy is strong.\n\nAs for the challenges, I think the next President will face some serious decisions to make on the economy. The economy is always something that's on people's minds, and I think there's concern about oil prices and the cost of living.\n\nBut I am confident the American people will continue to choose a leader who is strong on national defense and can keep our economy strong.\n\nAnd I'm also confident that come November 2008, the American people will be talking a lot about who's got the most experience, who's got the best vision for winning the war on terror, and who's got the best plan to keep America's economy strong.\n\nBut I'm not going to be on the ballot, so it's going to be up to my successor as to see who that is."

As I've said before, I believe that a rate reduction is essential to stimulating economic growth, and I'm committed to seeing it through.\n\nNow, when it comes to the quick, short-term stimulus, I understand that Congress is considering various options. While I'm open to different approaches, I do think it's essential that we link these two initiatives in some way.\n\nIdeally, I'd prefer to have a single package that includes both the rate reduction and the short-term stimulus. This would provide clarity and certainty for the American people and the business community, and it would ensure that we're taking a comprehensive approach to boosting economic growth.\n\nThat being said, I'm a pragmatic person, and I'm willing to consider alternative approaches. If Congress can provide a verifiable promise that they'll take up the rate reduction later, I'd be willing to consider that as well.\n\nBut let me be clear: the rate reduction is not optional. It's essential to our economic growth strategy, and I'll continue to push for it. I'll work with Congress to find a solution that works for everyone, but I won't compromise on our core principles.\n\nAnd let me add one more thing. I believe that we need to move quickly on this. The American people are looking for action, and they're looking for leadership. I'm committed to providing both, and I'm confident that we can find a solution that works for everyone. Thank you."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for your question.  Well, I understand there's been some concern, and I want to address that concern right off the bat. We're not talking about privatizing Social Security. We're talking about giving people a chance to invest a portion of their money in the market, just like many federal employees do. It's an option, a voluntary option.\n\nNow, in terms of the transition costs, I've asked the bipartisan commission we set up, led by Richard Parsons and James Baker, Mike Leavitt and others, to look at various proposals to address this issue. We're committed to exploring all the options to make sure that the transition is orderly and costs are manageable.\n\nNow, we're not going to raise the payroll tax to cover this transition, as some have proposed. I believe that would be unfair to the American people. We need to be mindful of the burden on the taxpayer, and we'll work closely with Congress to figure out the best way to phase this in.\n\nI also want to emphasize, though, that the current system is unsustainable in its present form. It's headed for bankruptcy, as the bipartisan commission has noted. We need to take action, or else we'll leave younger workers with a ticking time bomb of unfunded liabilities. This is a problem we can't afford to ignore.\n\nSo I'm committed to working with both parties to find a solution that will not only save and strengthen Social Security but do it in a way that's responsible, that doesn't raise taxes, and that strengthens the system for future generations. And I think we can do that, and I'm hopeful we can get there in a timely fashion."

I'll start by saying that the United States views the rise of China as a significant development, and we're approaching it with a sense of realism and pragmatism.\n\nWhile it's true that we have concerns about China's military modernization and its potential implications for regional security, we also believe that China's economic growth and integration into the global economy can have positive benefits for the region and the world.\n\nRegarding Australia's role, I have to say that I'm very pleased with the state of our alliance with Australia. We've had a long-standing relationship built on shared values of democracy, freedom, and a commitment to stability in the region.\n\nI believe Australia can play a critical role in managing the emerging relationship between the United States and China. As a respected and influential player in the region, Australia can help facilitate dialogue and cooperation between our two nations, particularly on issues such as counter-terrorism, non-proliferation, and regional security.\n\nFurthermore, as a trusted ally, Australia can help us promote a more balanced and nuanced view of China's rise, one that acknowledges both the opportunities and the challenges that come with China's growth.\n\nWe value Australia's expertise and insight on regional matters, and we look forward to continuing to work closely with your country to address the complexities of the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nI think it's also worth noting that our trilateral dialogue with Japan and Australia has been very helpful in coordinating our approaches to regional security issues, including China's emergence."

The \"stand up/stand down\" policy remains a guiding principle of our approach, but I must emphasize that the situation on the ground is dynamic and ever-changing.\n\nWhile we have made significant progress in training Iraqi security forces, the enemy is adapting and evolving as well. The numbers you mentioned, 294,000 trained Iraqi troops, are indeed impressive, but we must also consider the quality and capability of these forces, not just the quantity.\n\nFurthermore, our military commanders and experts advise me that the situation in certain regions of Iraq, particularly in the Sunni heartland and in Baghdad, requires a sustained coalition presence to ensure stability and security. The Iraqi armed forces, as capable as they are, still require our support and guidance to tackle the insurgency and sectarian violence.\n\nMake no mistake, we are committed to reducing our troop presence in Iraq as conditions permit. But we will not make decisions on troop withdrawals based solely on arbitrary benchmarks or timetables. Our decisions will be guided by the recommendations of our military leaders, the Iraqi government's readiness to assume greater responsibility, and the overall security situation on the ground.\n\nSo, I would not say that the goalpost is moving, but rather, we are continuously reassessing and adjusting our strategy to respond to the fluid situation in Iraq. And I'm confident that, with our continued support and the growing capabilities of the Iraqi forces, we will ultimately achieve our goals and bring our troops home."

We were facing some very serious threats, and I'm not going to apologize for taking the actions that I took to try to protect this country.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the program was deemed lawful by the Justice Department. Now, I understand there may be some concerns and some differing opinions on this matter, but I believe that the actions we took were necessary, and they were constitutional.\n\nIn terms of the process, I will say that we have been very transparent in terms of the overall program, in terms of advising members of Congress of its existence, and explaining the rationale behind it."

They're a threat to peace, they're a threat to our allies, they're a threat to the stability of the region.

We both understand the threat, and we both understand that we're working towards a diplomatic solution. Now, I'm not going to speculate on what Israel may or may not do, but I will tell you that we're working closely together on this issue.\n\nRegarding the mixed messages from Iran, I think it's quite clear what's going on here. They're trying to confuse the world, they're trying to delay, and they're trying to avoid confronting this issue head-on. But I'm convinced that the world will not be deterred. We will continue to work through the United Nations, we'll work with the Europeans, we'll work with our other allies to address this problem.\n\nNow, the Strait of Hormuz, that's a very serious business, and I think it's in the world's interest that this strait remain open. We'll take the necessary precautions to protect our interests, to protect our allies, and to ensure that the global economy is not disrupted.\n\nSo, we're taking a sober look at this situation.

And I believe that, in this case, the pardons that were granted were done so in accordance with the powers vested in me by the Constitution.\n\nThat being said, I also recognize that there is a sense of disappointment and disillusionment among some Americans who feel that justice was not served in this case. And I want to assure those individuals that I understand their concerns. However, I also want to reiterate that the decision to grant pardons was made after careful consideration and consultation with the relevant authorities, including the Attorney General and the Justice Department.\n\nAs for the legacy of the sixties, I believe that it's essential for leaders to take a stand and acknowledge when mistakes have been made. And I'm committed to doing just that. I've taken steps to address the excesses of the past, including the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal, and I've made it clear that we will not tolerate any form of abuse or corruption in our government.\n\nBut I also want to emphasize that we must move forward, as I said, while acknowledging the past.

The notion of nation-building, as you put it, has taken on a different context in this particular case.\n\nWe have begun to think about what kind of government would be acceptable to the Afghan people. And I think that's the key. We want a government that is going to be acceptable to the Afghan people, a government that is broad-based, that is representative of the different factions, the ethnic groups, the different points of view within Afghanistan.\n\nAs for King Zahir Shah, we've had some contact with him. We have not made any decisions about what role, if any, he might play in a future government. We are open to listening to his thoughts and his ideas, but ultimately, the decision is going to be made by the Afghan people themselves. We're not going to impose our will on them, but rather, we're going to try to facilitate a process that will allow them to choose their own leadership, their own government.\n\nNow, it's a difficult process, I understand that. Nation-building is not as easy as just walking into a country and saying, \"Here, this is the kind of government we want.\" It's much more complicated than that. But we are going to work towards a broadly based government, a government that is acceptable to the Afghan people.\n\nI also want to make it very clear that our goal is not to create a model democracy in Afghanistan. Our goal is to create a country that is no longer a haven for terrorists. And if we can achieve that goal, then we will have achieved a major victory in the war on terrorism."

However, I believe that the analysis you're referring to is incomplete, because it does not take into account the dangers posed by a Saddam Hussein who is allowed to retain his arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThis is a man who has used poison gas on his own people, who has invaded neighboring countries and who has shown a willingness to cooperate with terrorist organizations. If we allow him to continue to possess these deadly capabilities, I fear that we will be inviting a catastrophe, not just for the Iraqi people, but for our own country as well.\n\nI understand that there is always a risk of anger and resentment when the United States takes military action. But I also know that we have a duty to protect the American people and our friends and allies from the threats that Saddam Hussein poses. We will work to minimize the risks and to ensure that any military action we take is proportionate and just, but I am confident that the threat posed by Saddam Hussein is real, and that we must take action to address it.\n\nAnd let me be clear: our goal is not to create new terrorists, but to help create a new and more peaceful and democratic Iraq, where the Iraqi people can live in freedom and security, without the shadow of Saddam Hussein's regime hanging over them.

The enemy we're fighting is a radical ideology that doesn't respect the rights of women, doesn't respect the rights of minorities, and is willing to use violence to achieve its objectives.\n\nAnd so, yes, I believe we ought to be promoting the kind of dialogue and understanding that you're talking about.  And I think President Musharraf has been a valuable ally in these efforts, because he understands the importance of promoting a moderate, tolerant and inclusive form of Islam.\n\nWe, the United States, have done a lot of work to promote interfaith harmony.

These benchmarks were set by the Iraqis themselves, with our help, and they're making progress on some of them. It's not going to happen overnight, and I understand the impatience of the American people. But I also know that if we give up now, the consequences would be severe. We'd be abandoning the Iraqis to a bloodbath, and we'd be sending a signal to the region that we can't be trusted.\n\nI'd like to correct you, by the way, Senator McCain did walk in the marketplace, but I think you should also note that there have been other cooperative efforts, such as the successes in Anbar province, where the Iraqis and the coalition have made significant gains against al-Qaeda.\n\nI understand the skepticism, but I want to assure the American people that we're doing everything in our power to succeed in Iraq. We're adjusting our strategy as needed, and we're working closely with our allies and the Iraqis to find a way forward. And I'll make one promise: I will not abandon the Iraqis, and I will not abandon our mission to bring stability to that region."

We're working together to find ways to address it. \n\nNow, when it comes to the instruments to get there, we do have a difference of opinion, and that's okay. That's what dialogue is all about. The Europeans, as you said, have taken a certain approach, and we respect that. In the United States, we've taken a more technology-driven approach, focusing on ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through innovation and voluntary action.\n\nNow, I know some people might say that a voluntary approach will not work fast enough, and I understand that concern. But what I would say is that our approach has delivered some significant results. For example, our Methane to Markets initiative has led to a significant reduction in methane emissions worldwide.\n\nNow, I'm not saying we've solved this problem yet. We still have work to do. But I think it's fair to say that we're making progress. The key is to find areas of agreement and work from there. And I'm committed to working with the Europeans and with other countries around the world to address this global challenge because, ultimately, we all share the same planet."

I do want to say that this administration, like all administrations, has a strong commitment to protecting classified information, including the identities of our brave men and women who serve in the intelligence community.\n\nNow, regarding the matter at hand, I want to say that I have considered this matter very carefully. I understand that this has been a topic of concern for some time now, and I've thought about it a great deal, not just as President, but as Commander-in-Chief.\n\nWhile I understand the particular circumstances that led to the disclosure of Valerie Plame's identity, I must say that I am disappointed \u2013 yes, I am disappointed \u2013 that we were not able to protect her identity, and that seems to be the end of it.\n\nNow, with regard to the question of the behavior of senior officials, I've got to say that this issue has been looked into, and it's been looked into extensively. As for what I've said to my senior officials, I think the American people understand that I had to consider all of the options available to me to handle the problems that were put at my doorstep. I can assure you that my senior officials and I are fully committed to our obligations to our people who work in the intelligence community, and we will continue to take steps to ensure that those secrets are kept.\n\nIn terms of what I would say now in relation to different aides, I'm not going to tell everybody in public what I may have said in private. I just can't do that. But I can assure you that I've heard from the investigative agencies, and they did review, indeed, all the facts pertinent to this in reaching the conclusions they reached."

I appreciate the opportunity to clarify my administration's position on this important issue. \n\nFirst of all, let me say that I'm proud of the energy legislation we signed yesterday. It's a significant step forward in our efforts to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, increase energy efficiency, and address climate change. And I want to commend Speaker Pelosi and Senator Reid for their hard work in helping us get this bill across the finish line.\n\nNow, regarding California's request to implement its own plan to restrict tailpipe emissions, I understand the state's desire to take bold action on climate change. And I appreciate Governor Schwarzenegger's leadership on this issue. However, our decision to deny California's waiver request was based on our concern that a patchwork of different state standards would create confusion, duplication, and ultimately, undermine our ability to address this issue at the national level.\n\nAs President, I believe it's my responsibility to ensure that we're taking a comprehensive and coordinated approach to addressing climate change. And that's why we've been working to develop a federal strategy that will provide a clear and consistent framework for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nNow, regarding my conversation with Vice President Gore, I can tell you that we had a productive and respectful discussion about climate change. We agree that it's a serious issue that requires immediate attention and action. However, we also have some differences in our views on how to address it. As you know, Vice President Gore has been a vocal advocate for more aggressive action on climate change, and I respect his passion on this issue. But as President, I have to consider a wide range of perspectives and interests, and make decisions based on what I believe is in the best interest of the American people.\n\nLet me be clear: addressing climate change is a priority for my administration. And I'm committed to continuing to work with Congress, state leaders, and the international community to find solutions that will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and promote a more sustainable energy future. Thank you."

I think it's a significant moment in our relations, and I don't view it as a stunt at all. In fact, I believe it's a manifestation of our commitment to the people of Benin and to the continent of Africa.\n\nAs you mentioned, we've had a long-standing relationship, but I think this trip marks a new chapter in that relationship. We're not just looking back at the past 47 years, we're looking to the future. And I believe that our partnership can help us address some of the big challenges that we face, whether it's HIV/AIDS, or economic development, or counter-terrorism.\n\nOne of the things that I'm most excited about is the opportunity to work together to improve the economic fortunes of the people of Benin. We believe that by increasing trade and investment, we can help create jobs and opportunities for the people here, and that's going to be a key part of our agenda during this visit.\n\nBut I also want to make it clear that this trip is not just about economics. It's about strengthening our partnership, our friendship, and our shared values. We believe in democracy, and we believe in the importance of human rights, and we're committed to supporting countries that share those values.\n\nSo, I don't think this is a stunt at all.

You know, as President of the United States, I've got to make some tough decisions, and one of those decisions is how to allocate my time.\n\nFirst of all, let me tell you, our diplomacy is not limited just to my physical presence. We've got an active diplomatic corps all across the continent, working with leaders, working with civil society, working with people to advance the values of peace and prosperity.\n\nBut as the President, I do get to make some decisions on where I go, and when. And I decided to come to Benin because it's a country that is making progress. It's a country that's making a difference. And I wanted to come and not only express our support for the President, but also to encourage the people of Benin to continue on this path of reform.\n\nNow, you're right, there are other parts of the continent that are struggling, and we're paying attention to those countries as well. Kenya is one example, and we're working closely with the Kenyan government to try to help them stabilize the situation and find a peaceful resolution.\n\nIn fact, just the other day, Secretary Rice was in Kenya, helping to facilitate a dialogue between the government and the opposition. And we're also providing humanitarian assistance to those who are affected by the conflict.\n\nSo, it's a balancing act, it's a tough decision, but I believe that by coming to Benin, we're not only celebrating success, we're also sending a message to the rest of the continent that we care, that we're engaged, and that we're committed to helping those who are committed to peace and prosperity.\n\nAnd that's a message that I think resonates not just in Benin, but across the continent. And so, that's why I'm here, and that's why I'm glad to be here. Thank you."

I'm happy to address this issue, and I'll start by saying that the United States and Canada have a long-standing relationship when it comes to energy, and we're exploring ways to expand that cooperation to the rest of the hemisphere.\n\nIn terms of a hemispheric-wide energy plan, I believe we need to start by recognizing the diversity of energy resources across the Americas. We have significant oil and gas reserves in North America, and of course, there are also important energy resources in Central and South America.\n\nWhat we envision is a system where energy can flow freely across borders, where it can be transmitted and traded in a way that's transparent and efficient. We want to promote a culture of cooperation and coordination among energy producers and consumers.\n\nNow, we've already taken some important steps in this direction. Prime Minister Chretien and I have established a bilateral working group to explore ways to expand energy trade between the United States and Canada. And through the Organization of American States, we're working with other countries in the hemisphere to develop a set of principles for a hemispheric energy strategy.\n\nThat strategy will focus on a few key areas, including promoting greater transparency and stability in energy markets, encouraging investment in energy infrastructure, and supporting research and development in new energy technologies.\n\nIn terms of commitments, we're already working together with Mexico on a number of energy projects, including a planned pipeline that will transport natural gas from Mexico to the southwestern United States. And we're also exploring ways to expand cooperation with other countries in the hemisphere on energy research and development.\n\nNow, I know that for such a plan to be equitable, it needs to benefit all partners, producers and consumers alike. That means we need to ensure that we're not just talking about energy exports, but also about energy access and energy security. We want to make sure that countries across the hemisphere have access to reliable, affordable energy, which is essential for economic development and poverty reduction.\n\nPrime Minister Chretien, would you like to add anything to that?"

    "gen_response": "Thank you for that question. First, let me clarify my position on this piece of legislation. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act is a crucial step towards upholding our nation's values and protecting the sanctity of human life. This procedure is, in my view, particularly heinous and should not be tolerated in a society that prides itself on being a defender of life and dignity.\n\nRegarding the broader question of a complete ban on abortion, my position remains steadfast. I do believe that there are certain circumstances under which abortions should be permitted, such as in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is at risk.\n\nHowever, I also believe that we, as a nation, have a duty to work towards a culture that values life in all its forms, from conception to natural death. And so, I will continue to support and advocate for policies that promote this goal, such as encouraging adoption, providing support for pregnant women, and ensuring that our young people have access to quality education on the value of human life.\n\nNow, regarding the case of Terri Schiavo, I'll just say this: I do believe that my brother, Governor Jeb Bush, was right to sign legislation that helped to ensure that Terri's case received the attention it deserved. It is, in my view, our duty as public officials to protect the most vulnerable members of our society, and in this case, that meant intervening to ensure that Terri's wishes, as expressed by her husband, were respected and carried out in a humane manner.\n\nHowever, I also want to acknowledge that this was a deeply difficult and complex case, and I believe that my brother's decision was made in good faith, with the best interests of Terri Schiavo in mind.

First of all, let me make it clear that our position is that Saddam Hussein is a prisoner, a prisoner of the Iraqi people, and he will face justice. We'll let the Iraqi authorities handle his case, but the idea of negotiating with him, I think, is pretty much a moot point.\n\nHe's got one choice, and that is to cooperate with the Iraqi authorities and to face the justice that he so rightly deserves. I mean, this is a man who has been responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of people. The idea of negotiating with him, I just don't think is a realistic possibility.\n\nNow, regarding the greeting, I think it's an interesting little anecdote, but I think it's been overplayed a bit.

The Vice President, Dick Cheney, and I are in constant communication with our top commanders, including General Abizaid. We have regular briefings, and I can assure you that we receive accurate and timely information about the situation on the ground.\n\nNow, I understand that there may be some discrepancy in the characterization of the insurgency. I think what the Vice President was trying to say is that the enemy is being actively pursued and engaged by our brave men and women in uniform. The insurgents are using tactics that are desperate, and that's a sign of their frustration.\n\nOn the other hand, General Abizaid and other commanders are looking at the situation from a different perspective. They're looking at the day-to-day realities on the ground, and they're seeing that the insurgency is still a force to be reckoned with. And I agree with them on that.\n\nSo, I don't think there's a disagreement between the administration and the commanders. I think there's a nuanced understanding of the situation, and we're working together to make sure that our strategy is sound and that we're making progress.\n\nBut let me make one thing clear: we will not be deterred by the insurgents. We will not be deterred by the naysayers. We will continue to work with our allies, we will continue to work with the Iraqi government, and we will continue to pursue the enemy until we achieve our goals.\n\nAnd I'm proud to say that we're making progress, despite the difficulties. We're making progress in training the Iraqi security forces, we're making progress in rebuilding the economy, and we're making progress in bringing hope and freedom to the Iraqi people.\n\nSo, I hope that helps to clarify the situation.

    "gen_response": "Well, thank you for the question. Let me just say that I understand the concerns of the American people when it comes to high gas prices. I was concerned about the price of gasoline in 2001, too, and that's why we proposed a comprehensive energy plan that had a number of different elements to it.\n\nFirst of all, I think it's important to note that our energy policy was designed to address a number of different challenges. We were concerned about the reliability of the grid, we were concerned about the lack of refining capacity, and we were concerned about the need to diversify our energy mix.\n\nNow, I know that some people suggested that we should have pushed for higher CAFE standards. I think the CAFE standards we did put in place have been effective in encouraging the American automobile manufacturers to produce more fuel-efficient vehicles. And I'm proud of the fact that we were able to get an increase in the CAFE standards for our nation.\n\nI do think, however, that one of the most promising areas is in the area of alternative fuels, and that's why we've invested heavily in research and development of new technologies, such as cellulosic ethanol, hydrogen fuel cells, and biodiesel.\n\nNow, I don't think that higher CAFE standards alone would have cured the problem of high gasoline prices. The fact is, the price of gasoline is set on the global market, and it's influenced by a whole range of factors, including the demand for oil from rapidly growing economies like China and India.\n\nSo, I think our approach was a comprehensive one, and I think it's laid the foundation for the U.S. to become more energy independent over time."

We've made a big decision in Iraq, a tough decision, to help the Iraqi people achieve democracy and freedom. I understand that there's been criticism. I respect criticism. But I also want to remind people that the decision I made was made in the best interests of our country and the world, to say that we'll spread democracy and freedom into parts of the world that are desperate for it.\n\nAnd the fact that we're in Iraq, fighting against al-Qaeda, will make it easier for us to deal with the Iranians, not harder. And I'm looking forward to, you know, having some discussions with leaders around the world about this issue.\n\nNow, regarding Prime Minister Maliki's trip to Iran, I think it's vital to understand that the Prime Minister of Iraq's got a lot of leeway, and he needs to make decisions that are in the best interests of his country. I didn't have direct conversations with him before he went, but I do know that we have the same goal in mind - which is a stable Iraq. And I'm optimistic that we'll be able to achieve that goal, despite some ups and downs.\n\nIt's also worth noting that our message on Iran is very clear. We're not isolated; the international community shares our concerns about Iran's nuclear program. And we'll work together to achieve a collective goal - and that's a free, independent Iraq and a Iran that's not a threat to its neighbors.\n\nLet me just say this, the world has spoken clearly on this issue. The Security Council has sanctioned Iran. I'm confident that we can work through our differences to achieve our common goals. We're committed to a diplomatic effort, but we will not back down.

And I still believe that was the right call.\n\nRegarding Al Qaida, we knew that they would try to exploit the situation, and we've been working to stop them. We've got a strong partnership with the Iraqi military, and we've seen successes in Anbar Province and other areas where the enemy's been pushed back.\n\nAs for the Iraqi government, we've been working closely with Prime Minister Maliki to build up the Iraqi army and police forces, and we're seeing progress. It's not easy, I know. But I have faith in the Iraqi people's desire for freedom and democracy.\n\nNow, I know there are doubts about our strategy, but I can assure the American people that we've got a plan in place for victory.

But I firmly believe that we made the right decision to take out Saddam Hussein. We took out a ruthless dictator, and we're now helping the Iraqis build a democracy.\n\nNow, that being said, I am always a man who thinks about the lessons learned. I've had discussions with our generals, with our diplomats, and with my advisors on ways we could improve the situation. But I still believe that we did the right thing.\n\nRegarding Afghanistan, I would argue that we did concentrate our efforts on Afghanistan initially. Remember, we took out the Taliban in '01. And we took out Al-Qaeda's sanctuary. And we've continued to work diligently with NATO, with our allies, to rebuild that country.\n\nHowever, I do think that the rise of the Taliban, nearly six years later, is a serious challenge. We need to make sure we've got the right balance of efforts in Afghanistan and in the broader War on Terror.\n\nOn the Lisbon Treaty, I think it's a bit early for me to comment.

It didn't take into account developing nations that are beginning to grow and are a huge part of the problem when it comes to CO2 emissions. And it also didn't take into account the flexibility and the creativity of the American people to come up with new technologies.\n\nSo, I think the decision was based on practicality and doing what's best for the American economy. Did I get frustrated, perhaps, with some of the rhetoric coming out of Europe and other places? Yes, I did. I think there's a lot of posturing, a lot of grandstanding. I think it's not in the best interest of our relations to make grand statements without backing them up with real deeds.\n\nI've said I'm committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

We've also taken steps to increase transparency and accountability in corporate America, from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to our efforts to strengthen the SEC.\n\nNow, I don't think it's a question of one or the other - do the people rule, or do corporate organizations rule? I think it's a both-and proposition. We need to create an environment where corporate America can thrive, but also where the American people are protected from abuse.\n\nAs for my own approach, I'd say it's a straightforward one: I'll work with anyone who's willing to work with me to make America a better place for all its citizens.

I'll continue to emphasize the importance of restraint, the importance of cooperation, and the importance of moving towards a peaceful resolution that results in two states living side by side, in peace and security."

Our economy is growing strong, jobs are being created, and Americans are more confident about their future.\n\nNow, I acknowledge that we're not out of the woods yet. We've made significant progress on fiscal discipline, but we've still got more work to do. Our tax cuts have stimulated growth, and I believe they're a key part of our recipe for success.\n\nAs for my father's experience, I learned from it. He didn't get the credit he deserved for turning around the economy, and I'm determined to make sure that Americans know the facts about our economic record. We've taken steps to reduce the debt, and we're committed to keeping our promise to the American people to reduce the federal budget deficit.\n\nNow, I'm not going to get into a lot of speculation about the campaign, but I will say this: we've got a strong story to tell, and we're going to tell it. And I'm confident that when the American people take a hard look at our record, they'll see that we're on the path to prosperity, and we're not going to let anyone \u2013 including my opponent \u2013 tear us away from that path.\n\nAnd one more thing: I think it's interesting that my opponent is spending so much time criticizing our economic record. I think it's because he doesn't have a compelling vision for America's economic future himself. We do, and we're going to keep pushing forward to ensure that every American can achieve their dreams."

And I think you can have a situation where a country isn't exactly mirror-imaging American-style democracy, but is a peaceful factor in the neighborhood.\n\nAnd that's why the definition of \"success\" is not only democracy, but is a government that responds to the will of its people and is a peaceful nation. And if we have a government that's willing to make peace, and the alternative is a government that is not willing to make peace and is hostile to the neighborhood, I think the latter is unacceptable.\n\nNow, let me talk about Palestinian issues. I have said loud and clear that the Palestinians need to develop a democratic society. I also believe that Israel should have a partner in peace, and that partner must be a non-terrorist partner. We have to be careful about promoting democracy, and then having that person fail to deliver. The road map is a way to, I think, to provide some clarity of vision for both the Israelis and the Palestinians."

I think it's a call to action from people who care deeply about the suffering of millions around the world. And I believe that it's a challenge that the developed world must answer.\n\nNow, as for whether I believe it's possible to make poverty history, I do. I think we have the resources, we have the knowledge, and we have the will to make a significant impact on poverty. The question is, are we willing to use them? And I think the G8 has taken a major step forward in making those resources available through debt relief, through increases in foreign assistance, and through our efforts to promote economic growth and trade.\n\nAnd now, on climate change... (pauses) Look, I've said it before, and I'll say it again: the jury's still out on the extent to which human activities are contributing to climate change. But I do believe that we need to take action to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. We need to address the issue of climate change in a way that's science-based, that's economically sound, and that's international in scope.\n\nAs for my personal responsibility as the leader of the United States, I believe that I do have a responsibility to lead on this issue. And we are leading. We're spending more on research, we're investing in new technologies, and we're working with our international partners to address the issue of climate change. It's a tough problem, but I'm optimistic that with concerted effort, we can make progress and find solutions that work for everyone."

The violence we're seeing in Baghdad is unacceptable, and my heart goes out to the families of those brave Iraqi police officers who lost their lives.\n\nBut I want to remind Americans that we are fighting a war against terrorism, a fight for freedom and stability in a critical region of the world. It's not going to be easy, and it's not going to be quick. There will be setbacks and challenges along the way, but we cannot let the enemy dictate our strategy.\n\nWe have a plan to train and empower the Iraqi security forces to take the lead in the fight against the insurgents.

We're going to continue to work hard to achieve that goal, and I believe that we will succeed.\n\nAnd I'd like to remind Americans that, while we've been in Iraq for a while, we've made tremendous progress.

We're a nation that values human life and the dignity of every individual. We've taken action to prevent such abuses from happening in the future, implementing new policies and training to ensure our military is held to the highest standards.\n\nRegarding Haditha, we are conducting a thorough investigation into the incidents, and we will follow the evidence wherever it leads.

I understand the concerns and the opposition in Congress, but I believe that with a bi-partisan approach, we can find common ground and move forward.\n\nWe're making good progress on a bill, and I'm optimistic about the prospects of passing legislation that will strengthen our borders, improve interior enforcement, and deal with the 12 million undocumented immigrants in the country.\n\nNow, I know there are different views on how to approach this issue. Some people want to focus solely on border security, and I agree that's essential. We need to secure our borders, and we're working on that. We're increasing the number of border patrol agents, improving surveillance, and enhancing infrastructure.\n\nHowever, I also believe that we need to address the issue of the undocumented immigrants who are here and have been here for years. We need to provide a pathway to citizenship that's fair, and it's earned. People ought to learn English, pay a fine, pay their taxes, and get in line behind those who have been waiting patiently to become citizens.\n\nWhat's holding up the process right now is negotiating with members of Congress on the specifics of that pathway and making sure we've got the right balance between security and compassion. My staff and I are working closely with Senators, as you mentioned, from both parties to address their concerns and find a solution that can pass.\n\nI'm confident that with a little bit of goodwill and a willingness to compromise, we can get a bill that the American people will support. It won't be a perfect bill, but it'll be a bill that makes our country more secure and our communities more just.\n\nI want to assure the American people that I'm committed to getting this done. We're working diligently, and I believe we can get a bill on my desk this year."

We've also implemented measures to improve teacher quality and ensure that resources are allocated effectively.\n\nIn the area of national security, we've taken steps to reform our intelligence agencies to prevent the kind of intelligence failures we saw prior to 9/11. And we've also implemented reforms within the Department of Defense to improve our ability to respond to threats and protect our country.\n\nRegarding the Libby case, I made the decision to commute his sentence after careful consideration and consultation with my team. While I understand the concerns about the decision, I believe it was a just one given the circumstances.\n\nAs for the Iraqi leaders, we're working closely with them to ensure they're taking steps towards democracy and responsible governance. We're also providing training and support to help them build their institutions and security forces.\n\nIn terms of holding people accountable, we've taken action against those who've failed to serve the American people well. For example, we've taken disciplinary action against officials at the Department of Justice who mishandled the US attorneys' dismissals.\n\nAccountability is an ongoing commitment, and we're continually working to ensure that our federal agencies, programs, and policies are serving the American people effectively."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you. Well, I appreciate the opportunity to address these important questions.\n\nFirst, on the issue of the war on terror in Afghanistan, I want to start by saying that this is not a partisan issue. The safety and security of the United States, and indeed the world, is a bipartisan concern. As President-elect Obama takes over, I expect that we will have a productive and cooperative relationship in addressing the shared interests of our nation.\n\nNow, I do believe that our strategy in Afghanistan, one that has been sustained over time, has been a successful strategy. We've made progress, but I also recognize that there's more work to be done. And I expect that President-elect Obama will bring his own perspective to this issue, and that's entirely appropriate.\n\nAs for whether Republicans will support his planning, I can tell you that we will always put the security of the United States first. And if the President-elect has ideas and proposals that we think will help achieve that goal, then we will certainly consider them, and we will be open to working with him to achieve our shared objectives.\n\nNow, with respect to Pakistan, this is a critical relationship for the United States. Pakistan is a key partner in the war on terror, and we've had a long-standing relationship with them. I think it's very important that we work with the Pakistani government to address the issue of terrorist networks and sanctuaries within Pakistan.\n\nI think it's essential that we use a combination of both diplomacy and military pressure to deal with this problem. I believe that our military forces have been working very effectively with the Pakistani military to address the issue of terrorism in the region.\n\nBut I also believe that we need to be mindful of the fact that Pakistan is a sovereign nation, and we need to work with their government to address these issues in a way that is respectful of their sovereignty.\n\nTo President-elect Obama, I would say that I think it's essential that we continue to work closely with the Pakistani government to address the issue of terrorism. I think we need to be firm, but we also need to be respectful.\n\nAnd finally, I think it's essential that we continue to support the Pakistani people, who are struggling with many challenges, including poverty and extremism. We need to work with them to address these issues, and to help build a more stable and prosperous Pakistan, which is in the interests of all of us.\n\nThank you."

That simply is not the case. We've had our differences with the Cuban government for many years, and I'm not surprised that there would be tensions, but I can assure you that we played no role in President Castro's decision to leave the summit early.\n\nAs for your second question, I think it's quite clear that a President of the United States, such as myself, would not have a meeting or encounter with Fidel Castro in the context of this summit.

We're making good progress in training and equipping the Iraqi security forces, and they're increasingly taking on more responsibility for their own security.\n\nThat being said, we do recognize that additional support will be needed in the short term to ensure the security of the electoral process. The Pentagon is working on contingency plans to surge additional troops into Iraq, if necessary, to support the elections.\n\nI'll tell you that we're looking at a number of options, but I don't want to speculate on specific numbers just yet. Our commanders on the ground are assessing the situation, and we'll make decisions based on their recommendations.\n\nIt's worth noting that the 6,500 troops you mentioned are currently serving in Iraq, and their extended tours will help ensure continuity and stability during this critical period.

The recent experience with Katrina and Rita has highlighted the need for improved response capabilities and better coordination between federal, state, and local authorities.\n\nWe took a hard look at our preparedness, and I was not satisfied with what I found. Our public health infrastructure is not where it needs to be, particularly when it comes to distributing and administering vaccines, antivirals, and other medical countermeasures in a timely manner.\n\nThat's why I've directed Secretary Leavitt to develop a comprehensive national strategy to deal with a pandemic flu. We need to make sure our first responders, hospitals, and healthcare systems are equipped to handle a surge of patients.\n\nNow, regarding the use of defense assets, I think it's a good idea. We need to be prepared to respond quickly and flexibly in the event of a pandemic. That may involve using military assets to support state and local responders, such as airlifting supplies, people, and medical equipment. We can draw on the expertise and resources of the Department of Defense to augment the civilian response efforts.\n\nBut let me be clear: our first priority is to support the states and local governments, not to supplant them. We want to work closely with them to build their capacity, share intelligence, and ensure that we're coordinating our efforts effectively.\n\nSo, we're working hard to get our act together, but I must say that there's still much to be done.

The Iraqi people, we've seen, have shown remarkable resilience, and we are working intensely, side by side with our allies and with the Iraqi government to quell the violence, to train up the Iraqi forces to take on that responsibility.\n\nWe will not abandon Iraq to a sectarian conflict. I mean, what that says to me is, it says to the terrorists, you've won, and to the Iraqi people, you're on your own. We can't live with that.\n\nNow, I've always said that we'll continue to adapt our strategy to the conditions on the ground. If things worsen, we'll reassess and make necessary adjustments. That's the hard work that Secretary Rumsfeld and the Joint Chiefs have been doing, along with Ambassador Khalilzad and others.\n\nBut we've got to stay true to our principles here: a secure, democratic Iraq is in our national security interest.

Our goal is to support the Iraqi government and security forces in their efforts to take control of their country, defeat the extremist elements, and build a stable democracy.\n\nWe are making good progress on that front, despite the challenges that remain.

However, when it comes to the security challenges in Iraq, our allies, including France, have a role to play in supporting the Iraqi government and the international efforts to bring stability to the region.\n\nBut I want to make it clear that the United States will not be rushed into making decisions that would undermine the progress we've made.

We must be able to verify that these missiles are indeed being destroyed, and that Saddam Hussein is serious about disarming.\n\nAs for an ultimatum or a deadline, I think it's fair to say that we are running out of time.

And I think it's a testament to the strength of our democracy that they have this option available to them.\n\nBut I want to make it very clear that my role as President is to stay out of this election and to work on the issues that face our nation. And I'm not going to get involved in the internal affairs of the state of California."

    "gen_response": "Well, thank you for your question. I appreciate it. First of all, let me just say that I'm committed to changing the tone in Washington. And I think that tone can be changed by working together to get things done. Now, regarding my statement in Texas, I was trying to draw a clear distinction between our approach to Iraq and that of the Democrats.\n\nI firmly believe that our strategy in Iraq, while difficult and complex, is one that is based on a vision for a stable and democratic Iraq that is a key to a stable Middle East. The Democratic position, as I understand it, is one that can be interpreted as a pullback, which would embolden the terrorists and result in a region that is less free and less stable.\n\nThat being said, I think we can have good and respectful debates about the strategy in Iraq without resorting to name-calling or heated rhetoric. And that's exactly what I'm committed to doing during the next two years.\n\nRegarding oversight and investigations, I believe that our administration has been and will continue to be fully cooperative and forthcoming with all the appropriate congressional committees and investigations. We have an obligation to the American people to be accountable for the decisions that we make and the policies that we implement.\n\nBut I will say this: we will work with the Congress to ensure that our national security efforts are not compromised, and that our administration and agencies can function effectively in carrying out their responsibilities. We're looking forward to working in a bipartisan way to get things done for the American people."

It's a benchmark, a way to measure success. I believe that General Petraeus and the Iraqi government will be able to make a clear assessment of the progress we're making.\n\nNow, I understand what you're saying about giving the enemy a date to focus on, but I believe that the Iraqi security forces, along with our troops, are up to the task of handling whatever challenges the enemy throws our way. We'll continue to work with the Iraqis to improve their capacity to deal with the insurgency.\n\nRegarding the phrase \"a different configuration,\" I'm not sure I'd call it a \"Plan B.\" What I am saying is that, as we assess progress, we'll be looking for ways to adjust our strategy to best achieve our objectives. We're constantly evaluating, adjusting, and refining our approach, and that's what I mean by \"a different configuration.\" We're not going to be rigid, we're going to be flexible and adapt to the situation on the ground.\n\nAnd I'd say that one of the things that's important for the American people to understand is that we're not just in a war against the insurgency; we're also in a battle of ideas. We're trying to help the Iraqi people build a stable, free society that's an ally in the war on terror, and we'll continue to adjust and adapt our approach to achieve that objective."

Well, I think it's fair to say that Dmitry Medvedev is a bit of an unknown quantity, and I think it's too early to make any definitive judgments about his leadership style or how much power he truly wields, especially with President Putin still influencing from behind the scenes. But I do believe that Russia remains a significant player on the world stage, and our next president is going to have to take that into account.\n\nNow, I know some folks have criticized my decision to look into Vladimir Putin's soul, and I'll admit that I was mistaken in thinking that he and I could build a strong personal relationship and trust each other. That didn't exactly pan out, did it? But I will say that I've always believed in engaging with leaders, even when we disagree, and trying to find common ground.\n\nMy advice to my successor would be to approach Russia with a clear-eyed view of their interests and our own. We've got to be realistic about the areas where we're going to compete, and we've also got to be willing to cooperate where our interests align. We need to be strong, but we also need to be smart.\n\nAnd I think it's also worth noting that Russia's a country that's still in transition, still figuring out its place in the world. They've got a lot of challenges at home, from demographics to energy to terrorism. And so, I think it's in our interest to engage with them, to try to understand their perspectives, and to find ways that we can work together on issues of mutual interest.\n\nBut make no mistake, we also need to be clear and strong in our resistance to any kind of aggressive behavior or attempts to undermine our allies or our interests. We've got to be firm, we've got to be consistent, and we've got to be united, as a country, in our approach to Russia.\n\nSo, that's my two cents on this. I hope it's helpful."

We are, indeed, reviewing our options in regards to Iraq and considering a range of possibilities. However, I will not speculate on what those options might include at this time.\n\nAs for our goals, the United States' top priority is to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein has failed to comply with numerous UN resolutions, and it's our firm belief that his regime poses a significant threat to the stability and security of the region, and potentially to the world.\n\nWe are also committed to promoting freedom and democracy in the region, and to seeing that the Iraqi people are able to live in a safer, more prosperous future. It's our hope that Iraq will become a partner in the region, and a member of the international community that respects the rule of law.\n\nRegarding Germany's contribution to the fight against terrorism, I want to express my deepest gratitude to the Chancellor and the German people for their efforts. Germany has indeed shouldered a significant burden, and their support has been invaluable. The United States values our partnership with Germany, and we appreciate the cooperation we've received on a range of fronts, from intelligence sharing to military operations.\n\nI'm satisfied with the progress we've made so far, but as you know, the fight against terrorism is ongoing. We'll continue to work closely with our German allies to ensure that we're doing everything we can to prevent terrorist organizations from plotting, planning, and carrying out further attacks."

But let me tell you, our message to Israel has been consistent: we want to see progress on the ground, and that includes addressing the issue of settlements.\n\nRegarding Chairman Arafat, we've made it clear that we have concerns about his leadership. We believe that he's got to take more steps to fight terrorism, to reform the Palestinian Authority, and to be a partner for peace. But that doesn't mean that we're telling the Israelis to stay in the settlements. We want to see a peaceful resolution to this conflict, and that means taking steps on all sides to get there.\n\nSo, I wouldn't take my silence as an indication of a change in policy. Our policies are clear, and we're working hard to get the parties back to the negotiating table. We're working with all parties, including our friends in Israel, to make progress on the ground. And I'm hopeful that in the days and weeks ahead, we can see some positive developments.\n\nAnd let me just say, we're not going to let the lack of progress in the peace process be dictated by the actions of one person.

If we were to fail in Iraq, it would embolden our enemies. It would hurt our reputation around the world. It would make it harder for us to work diplomatically on other issues.\n\nThis reconstruction aid package is not just about helping the Iraqis, it's also about helping ourselves. We're trying to create a stable and secure Iraq, which will allow us to reduce our military presence there and bring our troops home. We're talking about the chance to succeed, a chance to create a region that is peaceful and prosperous.\n\nAnd I think the American taxpayer is willing to shoulder the burden, the financial burden, of this because they understand the consequences of failure. We're talking about a total of $87 billion for this fiscal year for the global war on terror, including this $20 billion aid package. That's less than one day's worth of the U.S. GDP per day.\n\nThis is an essential and necessary investment in our national security. And I believe the American people understand that."

The beheadings are a grim reminder of the nature of the enemy we're facing, and the evil they represent.\n\nRegarding Al Zarqawi, I want to assure the American people that we are aggressively going after him, and our forces are working closely with Iraqi security forces to bring him to justice. It's a very difficult task, but I have every confidence that our military will ultimately succeed in apprehending or neutralizing him.\n\nConcerning General Abizaid's comment, I appreciate his assessment, and I have great respect for the General. However, I want to emphasize that we are constantly reviewing and assessing our troop levels in Iraq to ensure that our forces have what they need to complete their mission. At the same time, our strategy is not solely based on numbers; it's based on a comprehensive approach that includes building the capacity of the Iraqi security forces, training them, and supporting their efforts to take control of their own country.\n\nI believe our current strategy is working. It's a tough fight, but I have every confidence that our troops, our coalition partners, and the Iraqi forces will ultimately succeed in securing Iraq and bringing democracy to the Iraqi people.\n\nThank you.

I'm saying that the mixed messages he's sending right now are having an impact on our efforts in Iraq.\n\nWhen American politicians talk about pulling out of Iraq, when they talk about abandoning our mission, it emboldens the enemy. It gives them hope that they can wait us out, that they can outlast us. And that's not good for our troops, it's not good for the mission, and it's not good for the Iraqi people.\n\nMake no mistake, the enemy is listening. They're watching our television, they're reading our press, and they're hearing the mixed messages that are being sent. And that's why it's so important for us to stay united, to stay focused, and to stay committed to our mission.\n\nAs for the campaign, I believe that debating the war in Iraq is a legitimate part of the process. But I also believe that we have to be mindful of the impact that our words can have on the men and women who are serving overseas. We have to be careful not to embolden the enemy, not to undermine our troops' confidence in their mission.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I do believe that the mixed messages being sent by Senator Kerry are having a negative effect on our efforts in Iraq, right now.

Now, regarding the issue you raised, I'm not surprised that some of our troops may be expressing concerns or questioning the mission. We're in a tough fight, and we've faced challenges we didn't anticipate.\n\nMy commanders in the field, including General Petraeus, are constantly assessing the mood of our troops, and they tell me that while there may be frustrations and fatigue, the overwhelming majority of our troops believe in the importance of our mission. They're proud to be serving, and they know their service is making a difference.\n\nAs for the concern, I'd say it's a minority opinion. We have over 150,000 troops in Iraq, and a vast majority of them are doing their duty with honor and distinction. That being said, I do take these concerns seriously, because our troops deserve our support and our understanding.\n\nWe're doing everything we can to support our troops, to improve their quality of life, to provide them with the resources they need, and to make sure they're equipped to succeed in their mission. I've also made it clear to my commanders that we'll be rotating troops in and out of Iraq in a way that minimizes the impact on individual soldiers.\n\nBut let me be clear: we cannot let the enemy dictate our strategy. We're fighting a global war on terror, and Iraq is a critical front in that war. We're making progress, and we will not be swayed by the critics or the terrorists. Our mission is to bring stability to Iraq, to help the Iraqis build a free and secure nation, and to protect our own national security. And we will see it through."

    "gen_response": "(determined tone) Well, thank you for the question. I understand the skepticism, and I understand the frustration. But I want to remind the American people and the press that we are dealing with a very complex situation in Iraq. It's not going to be easy, and it's not going to be solved overnight.\n\nFirst, let me say that I do believe the surge is working. The military progress we've made has been substantial. The sectarian violence has decreased, al-Qaeda in Iraq is on the defensive, and we are seeing some of the Sunni tribes turn against the terrorists. That's a positive development.\n\nNow, regarding the benchmarks, I think it's essential that the Iraqi Government must demonstrate that they are capable of governing this country. They need to demonstrate that they can make tough decisions, that they can work together, and that they can take ownership of their own future.\n\nOne of the benchmarks that I've talked about is the passing of the hydrocarbon law, which will help to bring some sense of economic stability to the country. Another benchmark is the provincial elections, which I believe will give the Iraqi people a voice in their own government. And, of course, the amnesty law, which would help to bring some closure to those who have suffered.\n\nBut, let me tell you, I also understand that this is not just a matter of checking the box. We need to see real progress on the ground. We need to see real reconciliation among the Iraqis. And, we need to see the Iraqis taking steps to secure their own country.\n\nIt's also essential that, we, the international community, continue to support the Iraqis in this effort. We need to continue to provide them with economic assistance, with diplomatic support, and with military help, as needed.\n\nSo, it's gonna take time, it's gonna take patience, but I am confident that we can make progress. And I am committed to seeing this mission through to its completion.\n\n(pausing)\n\nAnd to the Iraqi Government, I say: \"We believe in you. We want you to succeed. We're committed to helping you succeed. But, we need you to take the lead, to take ownership of your own future, to make tough decisions, and to work together to build a democracy that's worthy of the great nation of Iraq.\""

We are looking at all options, but I want to assure the American people that any decision we make will be based on recommendations from our military leaders on the ground, and we will choose the course of action that we believe best achieves our objectives.\n\nRegarding the comparison to Iraq, I would say that each situation is unique, and we must approach them differently. In Iraq, we had to adjust our strategy because of the changing circumstances on the ground, and we did. The surge has been successful, and we're beginning to see progress.\n\nNow, regarding Afghanistan, I agree with some analysts that the Taliban and al-Qaeda are resilient, and they continue to pose a threat to the people of Afghanistan and to regional stability. We're working closely with our NATO allies to address these challenges, and I appreciate the contributions they're making.\n\nHowever, I also agree that more can and should be done by our allies. We need a shared commitment to success in Afghanistan, and we're expecting our partners to step up and do their part. We're not going to tolerate an uneven distribution of responsibilities in the fight against terrorism.\n\nNow, as for the troop levels in Afghanistan, we're studying all options and taking into consideration our military leaders' advice. No decision has been made on troop levels, but any increase in troop levels would be because we believe it would enhance our ability to achieve our objectives, not as a substitute for our allies' commitments.\n\nI hope that answers your question.

We've seen this kind of behavior from the North Koreans before.\n\nBut we're going to keep the pressure on. We're going to continue to negotiate, and we're going to continue to push for that disclosure. And if we don't get it, we're going to have to consider other options.

And we understand now that it's not just a matter of our own security, but also about promoting liberty and democracy around the world.\n\nAs I said in my second inaugural address, it's a time of great change in the world, and we can be changed by it, or we can lead it. The choice is that stark. I believe that freedom is the alternative to ideology of hatred, and we must nurture it. And that's what changed since 2000. My views as a president since taking office have been shaped by the attacks, by the oath that I took to protect the American people, and by the realization that our own nation's security is linked to the spread of liberty around the world.\n\nAnd let me just add that it's not a Democracy 'project,' but it's about helping people realize their own aspirations for freedom and the chance to build a better life for themselves and their children.

Now, I know some folks might say, \"Well, you haven't gotten the results you wanted.\" But I'd say, we've had some significant accomplishments, and we're building a foundation for future reform.\n\nLet me tell you, the fact that the Democrats control Congress doesn't change my approach. I'm still going to use this microphone to promote my vision for America. I'm still going to push for the values and principles that I believe in.\n\nNow, I will say, I'll be adapting my strategy. I'll be working to build more bipartisan support, reaching out to Democrats and Republicans to find common ground. I'll be using my executive authority to get things done, where I can. And I'll be using this microphone to explain to the American people why these reforms are important.\n\nLook, the American people are looking for results, and I'm committed to delivering them. I'm a optimistic person, I'm a patient person, but I'm also a persistent person. And I'm going to keep using this microphone, and all the tools at my disposal, to push for the reforms that I believe in.\n\nAnd let me tell you, I'm not naive. I know that it's going to be a challenge, but I'm up for it. I'm ready to work with the Democrats, to find common ground, and to get things done. And I'm confident that, ultimately, we'll make progress, and we'll get the results that the American people are looking for."

First, let me just say that the Taliban has become a more brutal organization since the days when we first liberated Afghanistan. They're more brutal, and they're more extreme.\n\nAs for who supports them, I think it's well-documented that these are the people who were quite busy prior to the War in Iraq and my presidency. Our intelligence and information supports the fact that unless girls are educated, communities are not empowered."

And I've reached out to Democrats on numerous occasions to try to find areas where we can work together. I've had some successes, and I've had some disappointments.\n\nNow, I think it's fair to say that the Democratic leadership in Congress has been more interested in obstructing our agenda than in finding common ground. I mean, take the issue of the war on terror, for example. I've had to veto a number of bills that I thought were detrimental to our national security, because Democrats insisted on trying to put conditions on our troops that I thought would undermine our ability to win the war.\n\nBut despite those challenges, we have had some successes. We've worked together on issues like expanding funding for children's health care, and on passing a comprehensive energy bill. And I've worked hard to build personal relationships with Democrats, like Senator Dianne Feinstein and Senator Joe Lieberman.\n\nBut I think it's also fair to say that I could've done a better job in finding common ground. I mean, I'm a strong leader, and I'm not afraid to take a stand on principle. But I know that tone and rhetoric can sometimes get in the way of building relationships. So, I've been trying to do a better job of listening to Democrats, and finding areas where we can work together.\n\nUltimately, my goal is to get results for the American people. And if that means working with Democrats to find common ground, then that's what I'll do. But I'm not going to compromise on my core principles, and I'm not going to back down from fights that I think are important to the future of our country."

This is a significant moment for Venezuela, and it's a testament to the strength of democracy in the region.\n\nI think it's also a rejection of the kind of authoritarianism that President Ch\u00e1vez has been promoting. The Venezuelan people have made it clear that they want a more democratic, more participatory government, and that's something that the United States supports.\n\nAs for President Ch\u00e1vez's comments, I'm not surprised. He's made similar comments about me and the United States before. But I think it's worth noting that this election was not about me or the United States; it was about the Venezuelan people and their desire for a more democratic government.\n\nI'm heartened by the fact that the Venezuelan people have rejected the notion that they need a strongman in power, and instead are looking for a more democratic, more participatory form of government. And I think that's something that we can all support.\n\nSo, we'll continue to watch the situation in Venezuela closely, and we'll continue to support the Venezuelan people as they work towards a more democratic future."

I want to make it very clear that the intelligence information that was provided to me and to Prime Minister Blair was credible and was based on a high level of confidence. We believed, and we still believe, that Saddam Hussein was a threat to the security of the United States and to the world, and that he was actively seeking to acquire nuclear capabilities.\n\nNow, it has come to our attention that some of the specific information regarding the purchase of uranium in Africa may not have been as solid as we thought. But let me tell you, the broader threat posed by Saddam Hussein and his regime was very real, and we had to take action to address it.\n\nRegarding the second part of your question, I want to make it clear that we are committed to helping the people of Zimbabwe and supporting their aspirations for democracy and human rights. We have concerns about the ongoing situation in Zimbabwe, and we are working with Prime Minister Mbeki and other partners in the region to try to resolve the crisis.\n\nRegarding a meeting with a representative of the opposition leader, I would say that we are open to meeting with representatives of all parties who are committed to peaceful and democratic solutions to the crisis in Zimbabwe. We want to see a resolution to the crisis that reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people, and we will work with all parties who share that goal.\n\nI want to emphasize, however, that we do believe that President Mbeki can play a constructive role in facilitating a resolution to the crisis. He has been actively engaged in efforts to promote dialogue and reconciliation, and we support his efforts. We believe that a comprehensive, African-led solution to the crisis is the most likely means of achieving a durable peace in Zimbabwe."

We're in the process of reviewing his proposal, and I'd say it's too early to give a definitive answer on whether we agree or disagree with every aspect of it.\n\nBut I will say that we share the same goal, and that's to make sure our intelligence community is better equipped to deal with the 21st-century threats. We need to be more agile, more accountable, and more focused on the threats that face our nation.\n\nNow, as for the restructuring, we're going to take a close look at it. I think the idea of strengthening the NID, I think that's a good idea. The National Intelligence Director should have the authority to direct, should have the authority to make sure that our intelligence efforts are focused on the threats.\n\nHowever, we're also going to carefully examine the funding and personnel authorities. We need to make sure that whatever changes we make, they're done in a way that enhances our national security, and doesn't inadvertently create new problems.\n\nOur National Security Adviser, Condoleezza Rice, and other officials here in the White House, are closely working with Chairman Roberts and other members of Congress to make sure that we get this right. We want to make sure that we don't just reform for reform's sake, but that we create a more effective and efficient intelligence community.\n\nSo, we'll take our time, we'll work closely with Congress, and we'll make sure that whatever changes we make, they're in the best interest of our national security."

Well, I think it's fair to say that the security situation in Baghdad is a challenging one, and we're working closely with the Iraqi government and our coalition partners to improve it.\n\nOne of the changes that we're considering is a new strategy that focuses on having more Iraqi security forces on the ground, working side by side with our coalition forces. We believe that by increasing the Iraqi presence and ownership, we can better address the sectarian violence that's been plaguing the city.\n\nNow, I want to caution that this is a complex issue, and there's no easy solution. We've got to continue to work closely with the Iraqi government to build up their capacity, their ability to secure their own country. But I'm confident that with the right strategy and the right partnership with the Iraqis, we can make progress.\n\nWe're also exploring ways to... (pausing for a brief moment) ...to increase the visibility of security in Baghdad. You know, it's a big city, and it's tough to secure every single neighborhood. But by having a more effective police force, a more effective Iraqi security force, I think we can... (pausing once more) ...make a difference.\n\nThat's a long answer to your question, but I hope it gives you a sense of the kind of changes we're considering. Next question, please!"

Now, regarding the issue at hand, I think it's fair to say that when it comes to terrorism, we both view it as a serious threat that necessitates a comprehensive strategy.\n\nNow, in the past, I have been critical of those who view terrorism purely as a law enforcement issue, because I believe that it's more than that \u2013 it's a war. And I still believe that. However, I also recognize that law enforcement plays a critical role in the global war on terror, and we must use all tools at our disposal to track down and bring to justice those who seek to harm innocent people.\n\nNow, I think there might be some nuance in our interpretations, but I think we're more in agreement than we are in disagreement on this issue. And I'll tell you why \u2013 the Prime Minister and I have spoken at length about this, and I know he shares my commitment to winning the war on terror.\n\nTo the Prime Minister's question, I think it's up to him to describe how his approach will differ from that of his predecessor. But I will say that I'm heartened by the fact that he has already expressed his commitment to our strong bilateral relationship and his recognition of the importance of our cooperation on issues like counter-terrorism and the spread of democracy.\n\n(Pauses for the Prime Minister to address the question)"

    "gen_response": "Thank you for your question. I'm glad to address the situation on the financial markets. First of all, I believe that housing prices are going to correct themselves, but at the same time, we need to recognize that the market is going through a bit of a rough patch. And the good news is that we've had strong economic growth over the past year, but we need to find ways to keep that growth going.\n\nNow, regarding the ability to borrow money, we've had some volatility in the credit markets recently, and it's had an impact on people's ability to get loans, to buy homes, et cetera. I believe that the Fed, the Federal Reserve, has taken some steps to help, by lowering interest rates and providing more liquidity to the market. But we're also working with the regulators and the financial institutions to find ways to stabilize the market and get more lending going.\n\nNow, as for a bailout for people who are losing their homes, I don't think that's the right term. What we want to do is help those people who are struggling to stay in their homes. We've got a number of programs in place already, such as the HOPE NOW initiative, that's helping families who are in trouble with their mortgages, to refinance and restructure their loans.\n\nBut I think it's also important to note that we've got to be careful not to oversubsidize the market. We don't want to put the government in the business of bailing out people who made bad investments. But we do need to help those who are struggling. So, we're working with the organizations that are providing assistance to people, to see if there's more we can do, within reason. We can't save every house, every mortgage, but we can provide support and help to those who are struggling.\n\nNow, we're also looking at other ways to restore confidence in the market. For example, we're exploring some additional legislative steps that could be taken to stabilize the market and prevent the kind of reckless lending that got us into this mess in the first place."

The United States values its partnership with Canada, particularly in the efforts to stabilize and secure Afghanistan. The Canadian military has indeed played a crucial role in the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan, and I want to express my deepest gratitude to the government and people of Canada for their contributions.\n\nAs for whether Canada has done its job and fulfilled its duties, I'll say that their efforts have been vital to the overall mission, particularly in Kandahar province. However, I'm not sure that I would agree with the notion that their job is done.\n\nWe must recognize that the security situation in Afghanistan remains challenging, and the fight against terrorism is far from over. The contributions of all coalition partners, including Canada, are essential to preventing Taliban and al-Qaeda elements from regrouping and extending their destabilizing influence.\n\nThat being said, I also understand the importance of burden-sharing and the need for partners to reassess their commitments from time to time. I have no doubt that the Canadian government will carefully consider its role in Afghanistan and make informed decisions that align with its national interests.\n\nUltimately, I'd like to emphasize the importance of continued international cooperation in Afghanistan, including the vital role that Canada has played. I look forward to continued collaboration with Prime Minister Harper and the Canadian government on this and other pressing global challenges."

We've made real progress. Iraq is a functioning democracy, thanks to the efforts of the United States and our coalition partners.\n\nThe Iraqi security forces are taking more and more responsibility for their own security. And as they do, we'll continue to reduce our military presence. And when we're done, we'll have succeeded.\n\nNow, I know there's a lot of critics out there who don't think that's possible. They believe that Iraq is a war that drags on forever. I strongly disagree. I firmly reject that notion. We've got a plan in place. We're making progress on that plan. And when we're done, there will be a stable Iraq that will be a ally in the War on Terror.\n\nNow, with regard to the question regarding the Prime Minister's meeting with the candidates \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 I think that's up to the Prime Minister to respond. Tony?\n\nAnd Prime Minister Blair says,:\n\nThank you, George. (laughter) Well, I'm not going to fall into the trap of expressing a preference. (laughter) That's not for me to do. I mean, they're all very nice people, I'm sure. (laughter) No, seriously, I did meet with all three candidates, and I thought it was a very useful meeting. The questions we face, of course, are the same for whoever is President of the United States in terms of the transatlantic relationship.\n\nI think that relationship is strong. It's deep. It's historic. And I think it will endure, whoever is President of the United States. We have common interests, common values that we share as nations, and I think that will continue to take us forward, whatever the outcome of the presidential elections.\n\nAnd as for a special kinship with any one of the candidates, I think, diplomatically speaking, I'm not going to go there.

We believe that peace in the Middle East is essential for the stability of the region and for the security of all the nations involved, including the United States.\n\nRegarding President Arafat's participation in such a conference, I am looking forward to seeing Chairman Arafat at the conference table, provided that he renounces violence and commits to a peaceful process. We believe that he is an important player, but we also believe that the Palestinian people need to know that their leaders are committed to peace.\n\nWith regard to the timeline for this conference, I've instructed Secretary Powell to accelerate our efforts to bring this conference about as quickly as possible. We're working closely with all parties, including the Israelis and the Palestinians, to resolve the necessary steps for this conference to take place in the near future.\n\nNow, regarding the question on the Iraqi regime. Saddam Hussein is a threat to his own people, and to his neighbors, and to the global village. We need to take the threat of Saddam Hussein seriously, and we are making it clear that there will be consequences for his actions. We have a range of options available to us, from diplomatic efforts to economic sanctions, to other options, to make it clear to Saddam Hussein that his regime must change its behavior.\n\nNow, let me be clear: I have said as clearly as I can there's one thing certain: Saddam Hussein will disarm, or we'll disarm him. And that is a decision that I make with moral clarity, working closely with our coalition partners and friends.\n\nWe are working with our allies to take the necessary steps to bring pressure on Saddam Hussein, and we will continue to explore all options to bring about a new government in Iraq, one that is more representative of its people, and one that will give hope to the Iraqi people for a better future.\n\nAnd, I want to emphasize, that our policy is to liberate the Iraqi people, not occupy Iraq, or to dominate Iraq, but to liberate the Iraqi people, and to help them achieve a better future."

But I will say this: I'm committed to doing what it takes to protect the American people, and if that means reforming our intelligence agencies, then we'll do it. We'll do it in a way that's smart, that's effective, and that makes sense.\n\nOne thing's for certain: we need to make sure that our intelligence agencies are working together seamlessly, sharing information and coordinating their efforts. We can't afford to have duplicated efforts or overlapping responsibilities. We need to streamline our operations and make sure that our people have the tools and the resources they need to get the job done.\n\nAnd let me be clear: I will take an active role in leading this effort.

When I first met with President Putin, I did believe that we had found some common ground and a shared desire to move our countries forward in a positive way.\n\nHowever, his recent comments and actions have caused me to reevaluate that assessment. I'm deeply concerned about the potential for destabilization in the Middle East and the implications of providing advanced weaponry to nations that don't necessarily share our values.\n\nAs the leader of the free world, it's my duty to express my concern and to ensure that we're taking steps to protect our allies and to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. I plan to have a candid conversation with President Putin about these issues when we meet, and I'll be looking for a clear demonstration of his commitment to responsible international behavior.\n\nLet me be clear: the United States will not stand idly by while nations that sponsor terrorism or pursue nuclear ambitions are armed with advanced weaponry.

    "gen_response": "I think that's a fair question. Let me try to answer it. First of all, I want to assure the American people that the training of Iraqi security forces is going very well. We have made significant progress, and I'm proud of what the Iraqi people are doing. They're taking control of their own country, and that's what the strategy is all about.\n\nNow, as for the numbers, I think it's a little misleading to look at just one number, which is the total number of Iraqi forces trained. What's important is the effectiveness of those forces on the ground. And I would argue, and our commanders on the ground would argue, that we do have Iraqi units that are performing very well.\n\nNow, you're right, during the same period, we haven't decreased our forces. But that's because our commanders have told me that, in order to fully train these Iraqi units, to make sure they're effective, they need the support of coalition forces. And that's what we're doing.\n\nNow, I believe, as the Iraqi forces become more effective, as they take on more responsibilities, we will be able to adjust our troop levels. And I've said that publicly. But I'm not going to get into a position where I'm making decisions based on polls or based on politics. I'm going to make decisions based on the conditions on the ground, and what our commanders tell me.\n\nSo, while the numbers may not be decreasing at the rate that some might expect, I believe we're making progress, and we will be able to make adjustments as the Iraqi forces become more effective. But it's a complex situation, and we've got to be patient and focus on the ultimate goal, which is a free and democratic Iraq."

However, I must respectfully disagree with his assessment of this deal. This agreement represents a major step forward in our efforts to address the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear program. It's a carefully negotiated agreement that takes into account the twin goals of verifiable denuclearization and strict economic and security measures.\n\nWhile it's true that the financial pressure we applied played a significant role in bringing North Korea back to the negotiating table, our strategy was always aimed at achieving a comprehensive agreement that addresses the core of the problem. We're not simply rewarding North Korea for showing up; we're requiring them to take meaningful steps towards disarmament and transparency.\n\nMake no mistake, this agreement isn't a free lunch. It comes with significant measures, including intrusive inspections and strict accounting for their nuclear programs. The financial benefits they'll receive are conditional on their compliance with the terms of the agreement. And if they were to cheat or renege on their commitments, the consequences would be severe.\n\nNow, I understand that some people may have concerns about this deal, and I respect their skepticism. But I believe this agreement represents the best available option for achieving our objectives in this challenging region.

Mike Mullen, who will take General Pace's place, is a man of great experience, great expertise, and great qualifications. I've worked with Admiral Mullen, and I'm confident that he'll do a fantastic job as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.\n\nNow, I know there's been some speculation about the fact that this might have been, you know, influenced by the politics on Capitol Hill.

And I think, in the end, we made a decision that was in the best interests of all parties concerned. But let me be clear: the decision to move forward with Admiral Mullen was not driven by politics; it was driven by a desire to do what's best for the country.\n\nSo, I'm confident that Admiral Mullen will do a fine job.

While Ray Hunt is a respected businessman and a long-time friend, that doesn't change our support for a national hydrocarbon law that would govern oil exploration and development in Iraq.\n\nIt's also important to note that the United States is committed to respecting Iraqi sovereignty and territorial integrity. We encourage companies to recognize those principles as they operate in Iraq. I do think this deal with the Kurdish regional government has the potential to complicate the discussions regarding oil legislation, which we believe is crucial for Iraq's future.\n\nAs a result, we have made it clear to all parties involved that we are encouraging them to work closely with the Baghdad government to find a solution that takes into consideration the interests of all Iraqis, rather than pursuing these kinds of agreements in isolation. Our goal is a stable and prosperous Iraq, and we believe a national hydrocarbon law will be a crucial part of achieving that."

But I believe it's essential to contextualize this issue. The Australian troops are being repositioned in Afghanistan, which is a critical front in the fight against al-Qaeda.\n\nI've spoken to Prime Minister Rudd, and I appreciate his commitment to continuing the fight against terror.

I understand that the recent developments in the region, including the challenges facing Prime Minister Olmert, have made the process more difficult. However, I believe that these obstacles, while significant, do not necessarily mean that peace is far away.\n\nNow, I want to be realistic \u2013 the construction of settlements in eastern Jerusalem and the occupied territories is a problem. It's a significant issue, and it needs to be addressed. The Israelis have a right to security and a right to express their concerns, and at the same time, the Palestinians have a right to their legitimate aspirations for a state. And the settlements, in my judgment, are not conducive to the peace process.\n\nThat being said, I still believe that there is a window of opportunity for peace. The prime minister and I have been in close consultation on this issue, and I'm convinced that he is committed to the process. And I urge the Palestinian leadership, as well as the Israeli people, to continue to work towards a peaceful resolution.\n\nIt's going to be a challenging journey, and we'll hit bumps along the road. But I've always believed that the door to peace is still open, and I'm committed to pushing that door open as wide as I can.\n\nNow, I'm not naive \u2013 I know that my \u2013 quote, unquote \u2013 \"deadline\" for peace by the end of the year is certainly ambitious. But I believe that by setting ambitious goals, we can make progress. And I'm not going to take my eye off the ball. We're going to continue to push forward with a sense of urgency and purpose, because I believe that the prize of peace is worth fighting for.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, I still believe that peace is achievable this year. And I'm committed to working with our partners in the region, with our allies and with the international community to make it happen. Thank you."

As you know, we've been working very closely with the international community, including our partners in the Six-Party Talks, to bring about a more peaceful and stable Korean Peninsula.\n\nRemoving North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism is a serious matter, and it's not something we take lightly. However, I'm pleased to say that we're making progress in our discussions with the North Koreans, and we're getting close to achieving several important milestones.\n\nAs for the specific timing, I'd say we're on track to take a decision on November 11th is not the correct date. I expect, assuming the North Koreans follow through on their commitments, that we can remove North Korea from the state sponsor of terrorism list shortly after we verify the disablement of their nuclear facilities, which is part of the agreement they made with the international community.\n\nNow, I want to emphasize that there are several preconditions that must be met before we take this step. First and foremost, the North Koreans must follow through on their commitments to disable their nuclear facilities, and we need to verify that they've done so. They must also provide a complete and accurate declaration of their nuclear programs, including any nuclear activities they've conducted in the past. And finally, they must also commit to not proliferating nuclear technology to other countries.\n\nIf these conditions are met, and we're confident that they're committed to denuclearization, then I believe it would be appropriate to remove North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism. But let me be clear: this is a step forward, not a final destination. There's still much work to be done to achieve our goal of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, and we'll continue to work with the international community to achieve that goal."

Let me start by saying that our missile defense is a vital part of our national security, and I'm committed to deploying a system that will protect the American people from the threats of the 21st century.\n\nNow, regarding the testing of the system, we're making great progress. We're on schedule, and we'll continue to do the necessary tests to make sure the system works. Now, I'll tell you, we're not going to wait for all the testing to be done before we start deploying the system. We'll start deploying the system, and then continue to test it.\n\nAs for the ABM Treaty, I think it's an outdated treaty, one that prevents the United States from exploring new defensive technologies. And I believe that's a problem. The treaty was signed during the Cold War, and it doesn't reflect the threats that we face today.\n\nNow, we'll work with our allies, we'll work with Congress, to figure out the best way to move forward. But I'm committed to building a missile defense system that will protect our country. And if the ABM Treaty gets in the way of that, we'll have to take a hard look at it.\n\nBut let me be clear: our goal is not to abrogate the treaty, but to adapt it to the new security landscape. We want to find a way to move forward in a manner that's consistent with our obligations and also allows us to defend ourselves."

As you noted, previous administrations have held this view as well. I agree with that assessment.\n\nIn my vision of a two-state solution, Israel and Palestine can coexist in peace, with both sides enjoying secure borders. However, settlement activity, especially the expansion of settlements, undermines trust and makes it harder to achieve that goal.\n\nI've had discussions with Prime Minister Sharon, and I've made it clear that our Administration's view on settlements remains unchanged. We encourage Israel to be mindful of its settlement activities, particularly in areas that could be \u2013 and I believe should be \u2013 part of a Palestinian state in the future.\n\nNow, I want to emphasize that we understand the complex issues at play here, including Israel's security concerns. But we must balance those concerns with the imperative of moving toward a peaceful resolution of the conflict.\n\nMy message to the Israeli Government is this: we value our relationship with Israel and we will always stand by our ally, but we also believe that it's time to take steps to get the peace process moving forward. That means taking a close look at settlement activity and working with the Palestinians to build a just and lasting peace. We're committed to helping both sides achieve that goal."

We appreciate the Italian contribution to the effort thus far. They've made a significant contribution, and we're grateful for that. We did talk about the possibility of Italian troops taking on more responsibilities, particularly in the southern part of Iraq, where the Italian troops are deployed. We think that's a very good idea. Our goal is to have a multinational division in Iraq, and we think the Italian contribution can be a significant part of that division.\n\nIn terms of reconstruction, we had a very good discussion about the needs of the Iraqi people. The Prime Minister and I are committed to helping the Iraqi people. We believe that the Iraqi people want to be free and live in peace, and we're committed to helping them achieve those objectives. We talked about, of course, the role of other countries that may not have been part of the coalition but are interested in participating in the reconstruction of Iraq. We're interested in countries participating, and we'd like to see other countries contribute to the efforts to help the Iraqi people. It's in the world's interest that Iraq become a free and peaceful country, and we're committed to working with others to achieve those objectives.\n\nIt's also worth noting that we discussed the role of the United Nations. The UN has got a significant role to play in helping the Iraqi people. We're committed to working closely with the UN, and I believe the UN can play a significant role in helping the Iraqis write a constitution and in helping with the reconstruction efforts.\n\nSo, all in all, it was a very good conversation. The Prime Minister and I see eye to eye on these issues, and we're committed to working together to achieve our objectives."

We believe the FARC, ELN, and the AUC are terrorist organizations that threat stability not only in Colombia but in our own hemisphere. We're working closely with President Uribe and his government to provide assistance, training, and support to help them combat these terrorist organizations.\n\nRegarding the peace process, I believe that President Uribe's government is taking the right steps to try to bring some of these groups to the negotiating table, but we must be cautious. We've got to make sure that any peace process is fair, transparent, and leads to a result that doesn't allow these terrorist organizations to continue to wreak havoc on the Colombian people.\n\nNow, regarding the conversation I had with President Uribe, we talked about our commitment to support Colombia in its fight against terrorism and our desire to move forward on a Free Trade Agreement. We believe that this FTA will be beneficial not only to the United States but also to Colombia, and we're committed to working with the Colombian people and the Colombian government to make sure that this agreement is fair and equitable.\n\nNow, regarding the issue of flexibility, I will tell you that we're open to listening to the concerns of the Colombian farmers and the Colombian people, and we're committed to making sure that this agreement is one that benefits both our countries. But we've also got to make sure that we're not sacrificing the principles of free and fair trade.\n\nAnd let me say something, I think it's very important for the American people and for the Colombian people to understand that this is a two-way street. There's going to be benefits for both countries. There's going to be more opportunities for trade, more opportunities for economic growth, and more opportunities for the Colombian people to realize their potential.\n\nNow, I know there are concerns, and we'll listen to those concerns, but I firmly believe that this agreement is in the best interest of both our countries, and we'll work hard to make sure that it's something that benefits both our countries.\n\nAnd, President Uribe, would you like to add something?"

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question. Well, let me start by saying that I am disappointed, but not surprised, by the actions of the Democratic leadership in the Senate. Their obstructionist tactics are becoming all too familiar. The American people did not elect me to nominate judges only to have them held up indefinitely by a minority of senators. I believe that every judicial nominee deserves an up or down vote on the floor of the Senate.\n\nNow, I understand that the Democrats are threatening to halt our agenda, but I say to them, what's the agenda? The agenda is to make America safer, to make America more prosperous, and to make America more just. And if they're willing to hold up good judges, the people who can help make that agenda a reality, then I say to them, that's not good for the country.\n\nThe fact is, my judicial nominees are highly qualified, well-respected individuals who will interpret the law and uphold the Constitution. They deserve a fair shake. And if the Democrats are going to continue to filibuster these nominees, then we will have to consider other options. One of those options is a change to the filibuster rule. I believe that's a extreme measure, but it's one that we're considering because the American people expect us to get things done.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I think both judges and our agenda are important. But if I had to choose, I'd say the agenda is more important because it's about the big picture. It's about creating a better America for all Americans. But I don't think we have to choose between the two. I think we can have both. I think we can have good judges and we can make progress on our agenda. But we need the Democrats to be willing to work with us to get that done."

We work together on a lot of issues, and I'm interested in seeing who the Mexican people choose as their leaders. As you know, democracy is democracy, and we're not in the business of picking leaders for other countries.\n\nNow, as for the issue of left-leaning leaders, I think it's interesting that many countries in our hemisphere are experimenting with different forms of government. Some are choosing a more traditional, I guess you'd say, social democratic approach, and others are choosing a more market-oriented approach. And that's what democracy is all about: choosing the leaders you want.\n\nBut let me just say that we are interested in working with whoever leads Mexico, to ensure that our two countries can work together on the issues that matter most: security, trade, and migration. We've got a lot of common interests, and I think we can work well with a leader from any part of the political spectrum.\n\nNow, regarding national security, let me just say that we've got a significant challenge on our southern border. We're working closely with the Mexican government to control and secure that border, to make sure that we're not allowing terrorists or other types of smugglers to cross into the United States.\n\nIt's a challenging task, but we're working hard to build up our own border security apparatus, and we're working closely with the Mexican government to make sure that we're sharing intelligence, sharing best practices, and making sure that we're doing everything we can to secure that border.\n\nAs for the issue of illegal crossings, I'll just say that we take these issues very seriously. We believe in the rule of law, and we believe in the importance of securing our own borders. We're working hard to make sure that we're able to protect our own citizens, while also respecting the rights of people who want to come to the United States and work.\n\nAnd I might add that it's also in our interest to make sure that the economies of Mexico and Central America are growing, so that people can find jobs in their own countries and not feel the need to come to the United States. So we're working on a comprehensive approach that addresses all these issues.\n\nBut we're committed to securing our borders, and we're committed to working with whoever leads Mexico to ensure that we're able to do so in a way that's respectful of our own laws and our own values."

I mean, that's the nature of democracy. But I am confident that on big issues, we can find common ground. I'm working very hard, as are my team members, to reach out to Democrats to find out where we can agree.\n\nYou know, I think one of the things that's sometimes misunderstood about my style is that I'm not a guy who tries to be confrontational for the sake of being confrontational. I try to be straightforward and honest. Sometimes that gets to voices raised. But I'm still very optimistic about getting a lot done. Do I wish things would go smoothly and easy? of course I do. But I'm a realist. And I understand that politics can be tough sometimes, and heated, and I can handle it. It's okay to disagree, that's the way the system is set up.\n\nBut you know, we may have disagreements, but on big issues, I think we can make progress. Social Security reform is a big issue, I know the Democrats have raised some concerns and I appreciate and respect their concerns. But I'm looking forward to listening to their ideas, taking a step back and finding that piece of common ground. That's what I'm committed to doing, and I think we can make progress.\n\nI'm not worried about getting enough done, I really am not. I'm an optimistic guy, I think we can get a lot done this year.

But in times of extraordinary crisis, and I believe we're in an extraordinary period, the Government has got to take action to provide liquidity and to provide some confidence.\n\nNow, the auto industry is very different from the financial industry.

We've got to be aware of the fact that there's still an enemy out there that wants to harm America and our values.\n\nIn terms of sacrifices, I think Americans will have to be patient with travel, for example. There's going to be more security checks, for example, at airports, and we're going to have to be mindful of our public gatherings, large gatherings, so that we can make sure that Americans are safe.\n\nBut I don't expect Americans to sacrifice their rights, their freedoms, or the way we live.

As the President of the United States, I can tell you that we do share some differences with our European allies in our approaches to combating terrorism. While we agree that economic and political factors can contribute to the root causes of terrorism, we also believe that a strong military response is necessary to disrupt and dismantle terrorist networks.\n\nI don't think it's accurate to say that we're solely focused on a military solution, though. We're working hard to build international cooperation on counter-terrorism efforts, including sharing intelligence, cracking down on terrorist financing, and promoting economic development in regions vulnerable to extremist ideologies.\n\nRegarding trade issues, we do have some differences with the European Union, particularly on agricultural subsidies and trade in services.

We have a very strong and close relationship with Poland, and we don't see their membership in the EU as complicating our bilateral relations.\n\nIn fact, we believe that Poland's membership in the EU will enhance our cooperation on a range of issues, including counter-terrorism, non-proliferation, and regional security.

We have worked closely together to tackle the threat posed by al-Qaeda and its affiliates, and I believe that our cooperation has been vital in making the world a safer place.\n\nRegarding the demonstrations, I am not surprised that there are differing opinions on the issue of the war on terror. As a nation, we welcome debate and dissent, and I respect the right of people to express their views peacefully. However, I must also emphasize that we cannot let the voices of a few dictate the course of our actions.\n\n(looking at the ITV News reporter) As for the people who hate or fear me, I can only say that as President, I have made decisions that are in the best interests of the United States and our allies.

But we also recognize that the European Union is an emerging player on the world stage, and we welcome its growing role in global affairs.\n\nOur talks today have indeed laid the groundwork for a new era of cooperation between the United States and the European Union, but I wouldn't necessarily call it a new track.

President Chavez is the leader of a country that is an important neighbor of ours, and we're concerned about some of the policies he's implemented.\n\nWe're concerned about the undermining of democratic institutions in Venezuela. We're concerned about the closing down of opposition voices. We're concerned about the jamming of the signals of television stations that aren't sympathetic to his government. And I think it's very important for leaders to stand up for democratic principles and the freedom to express themselves.\n\nNow, threat? I think President Chavez has made some decisions that are not in the best interest of the Venezuelan people, and that's our concern. We want to make sure that we're working with our friends in the hemisphere to promote free trade, to promote democratic institutions, and to make sure that these familiar tactics don't undermine the progress we're making.\n\nAnd, President Vazquez, I'd be happy to have you address your part of the question.

I've had a good relationship with President Putin, and I've worked hard to establish a dialogue with him on a lot of issues.\n\nRegarding proliferation, I'm concerned about Russia's behavior when it comes to sharing sensitive technologies with nations that could potentially use them for not so peaceful purposes. Iran, in particular, is a concern, as you mentioned. We've had numerous discussions with the Russians about this, and we've asked them to be more mindful of the consequences of their actions. I believe President Putin understands our concerns, but we need to see more tangible progress on this front.\n\nOn the question of democracy, I'm a strong believer in the potential for Russia to become a full partner in the community of democracies. President Putin has said that he wants Russia to be a democratic country, but we've seen some worrying signs, particularly with regards to the media and civil society. The Russian government's actions in Chechnya have also raised concerns.\n\nNow, I want to emphasize that I think it's essential to maintain an open dialogue with Russia, even when we disagree. I've told President Putin that we'll be watching closely to see how Russia handles these issues, and we'll be working with them to try to address our concerns.

Our commitment to free trade is unwavering, and we believe that the measures we're taking are essential to ensuring that American industries remain competitive in a rapidly changing global economy.\n\nNow, on the question of China, our decision to impose quotas on certain imports from China is a matter of fairness.  We've long argued that China's accession to the WTO requires it to adhere to the same rules as everyone else.  Unfortunately, persistent imbalances in our bilateral trade relationship necessitate decisive action.\n\nRegarding our disagreement with the WTO on steel, I believe this is a matter of national sovereignty and vital American industries.  The massive surge in steel imports has decimated our domestic producers.  While I value the WTO process for resolving disputes, I will not tolerate reckless practices that threaten critical U.S. industries.\n\nThe dollar's fluctuations are primarily driven by the markets, of course.  It's been my administration's policy to let markets instead of governments determine currency exchange rates, which helps the currency reflect true economic fundamentals and global conditions.\n\nFinally, let me state our commitment to worldwide commerce and fair trade remains strong.  President Blair shares our enthusiasm, and we've long agreed that our respective nations will work together, internationally and within the WTO framework, to contribute to mutually beneficial arrangements across the globe.\n\nI believe America benefits from the free market system and fair trade, which most helps those who earn their incomes through labor and are businesses that strive for competitive success and cultivate status all while benchmarking for the globalized market here and abroad in the U.S."

Iraq's sovereignty will be full as of June 30th, as we've been saying all along.  The Iraqi interim government and that country will be a sovereign nation.\n\nI'm not going to -- I'll let the Prime Minister speak for himself, but we are comfortable with the understanding that the Iraqis, the Iraqi government, will have full sovereignty over their country, and we will be there to help them, of course.

And we're going to do it in a way that is humane, in a way that conforms to our values, and in a way that is, within the law. I've got great confidence in our justice system, which is the envy of the world, and I've got great confidence in our military. We will find a way to transmit to the value that we hold dear, of respect for human life, to make sure people are treated in a humane manner.\n\nBut let me be clear, we will not use torture as an interrogation technique.

The Iranian regime's nuclear ambitions pose a threat not only to the region, but to the entire world.\n\nRegarding the possibility of military action, I want to emphasize that we are committed to diplomacy and dialogue as the preferred course of action. We are working closely with the international community, including our European partners, to address the Iranian nuclear issue through the UN Security Council.\n\nAs for the notion of needing a UN Security Council mandate for any potential action, I want to be clear that we will exhaust all diplomatic efforts before considering any military options. We will work with our allies and partners to ensure that any actions taken are necessary and proportionate.\n\nBut I must also make clear that as president, I will not rule out any options when it comes to protecting the security of the American people, our allies, and the international community. We will take the necessary steps to address the threat posed by Iran, and we will do so in close consultation with our European partners and the international community.\n\nLet me be clear: we will work together to address this challenge, but we will not be limited in our ability to take action when necessary."

And we've made some decisions that, in hindsight, we might have done differently. But I'm the president, and I'm the one who's going to take the responsibility for those decisions.\n\nI don't want to play the blame game, but I will say that we've had some successes in Iraq, and we've had some setbacks. And we're working hard to have more successes. But the war in Iraq is a tough war, it's a difficult war. It's a war that we've got to continue to fight, because if we don't, the consequences would be dire.\n\nSo, I think Don Rumsfeld is doing a fine job, and I'm not going to make a change."

We've got a lot at stake - stability, security, and the spread of freedom. And we're going to stay engaged, but we're going to do it in a smart way.\n\nRegarding the Secretary of State, I would not rule out a trip to the region in the near future. Secretary Rice has been doing a fantastic job in working with our allies, working with the parties involved, to bring about a lasting peace. And if her going to the region can help achieve that goal, then I wouldn't hesitate to send her.\n\nAs for me going to the region, I'd love to go. I think it's essential for the President of the United States to be seen as a partner in the peace process. I believe my presence could help to solidify the gains that we've made, and to give encouragement to those who are working towards peace.\n\nNow, what it would take for me to go? Well, it would take a situation where I believe my presence could make a significant difference. Where the parties are ready to make concessions, where we've got a clear path forward, and where my being there could help to accelerate the process.\n\nBut make no mistake, one of my main priorities is to support the efforts of the parties involved, to support the efforts of our allies, and to make sure that we're not getting too far ahead of what the parties themselves are willing to do. We're not going to impose peace on the region. We're going to support those who are working towards peace, and we're going to be a partner in the process.\n\nThank you for your question."

Let me clarify that the United States has always supported the right of Israel to defend itself, and the separation barrier can be a legitimate means to achieve that goal.\n\nHowever, we do have concerns about the route of the fence, particularly when it deviates from the Green Line and goes into the West Bank. I've expressed these concerns directly with Prime Minister Sharon and other Israeli leaders.\n\nWhat we're worried about is making sure that the fence doesn't, in its current configuration, harm the prospect of a two-state solution and make it more difficult for the Palestinian people to live in their own land.\n\nOur opposition, therefore, is not to the concept of a separation fence per se, but to the particular route that's been chosen by the Israeli government, which we believe could be a barrier to peace and a barrier to the hopes of the Palestinian people.\n\nWe're working closely with both the Israelis and the Palestinians to find a solution that will allow the fence to be a security measure that doesn't in any way infringe upon the Palestinian people's aspirations for a peaceful and secure future.\n\nSo, to summarize, we support the right of Israel to protect itself, but we want to make sure that this security measure doesn't become a permanent obstacle to peace."

I think it's a very important work that he's done.\n\nI was not surprised that David Kay's preliminary report did not find the stockpiles of chemical or biological weapons that some of our intelligence suggested were there. As I said in the State of the Union, intelligence is not perfect. We had evidence, based on intelligence reports, that there was a weapons program, a weapons program that was a threat to our security. And I used that evidence to make a very difficult decision.\n\nNow, I want to remind people that Saddam Hussein was a very cunning and secretive leader. And as time goes on, and as our inspectors continue to look, I'm confident that the evidence of his attempt to acquire and develop these terrible weapons will be found. I also want to remind people that he's a man who had a lot to hide, and that's why we went in, because he wouldn't disclose that which we knew.\n\nAnd as for credibility, I think our credibility is still very strong. I think the American people understand that our decision to go in and protect the United States and the world from a threat was a reasonable decision based on the best intelligence available. And I'm confident that as more evidence comes out, that our credibility will be shown to be intact.\n\nBut, as I said, I take these questions very seriously. And I want to assure the American people that we're going to get to the bottom of this, and we'll find out what's in that country.

I did direct the Attorney General and other agencies to review the PDB and see if we needed to take any additional steps. I was briefed by CIA Director Tenet and FBI Director Mueller on the threat, and we began to work on disrupting the al-Qaeda's ability to plan and carry out these attacks.\n\nHowever, like I said, we didn't have the exact information on the 9/11 attacks, and our main focus was disrupting the al-Qaeda's operations in Afghanistan.

Our drawdown will be determined by conditions on the ground, and the readiness of Iraqi forces to take over security responsibilities from coalition forces. We've made significant progress on that front, and I'm proud of the work that our military has done with the Iraqi security forces to give them the training and support they need.\n\nAs I said, the seating of the Iraqi Parliament is a significant milestone, and I'm encouraged by the progress they're making.

And the idea of withdrawing from Iraq before the job is done would be, in my opinion, a serious mistake.\n\nIf we prematurely withdraw, it will allow the enemy to focus on their primary objective, which is to make the United States flinch, and then retreat, and then take advantage of our leaving the battlefield. And I am concerned that would increase the risk of another attack on our soil.\n\nNow, regarding Senator Obama's statement, it sounds like he is thinking along the same lines as I am, which is to say that if al-Qaeda is creating a safe haven in Iraq, we must take action. The key, however, is to make sure that we don't create a self-fulfilling prophecy by allowing our enemies to have the upper hand.\n\nWe've got to stay the course. We've got to continue to work towards our objectives in Iraq. We've made progress. We must continue to make progress.

And you're right, we have, in fact, estimated the costs of our military campaign in Iraq. But let me tell you, these estimates are rough, and they're subject to change.\n\nWe've got a Department of Defense that's working hard to refine those estimates, and we'll be glad to share them with the American people once they're more concrete. I don't want to speculate or guess at this point. I think it's responsible to have a more solid number before we start throwing numbers out there.\n\nThat being said, I will tell you that we're committed to making sure our troops have the resources they need to complete the mission. We're committed to rebuilding Iraq, and we're committed to securing our country. And we'll do that with a fiscally responsible approach, but also with a commitment to getting the job done.\n\nAnd I think it's also worth noting that, you know, we're talking about the cost of freedom. And freedom's not free. It's not cheap. And we've got to make decisions based on what's best for this country, not just based on short-term costs. But we'll continue to work hard to make sure the American people know what they're getting into, and we'll work hard to be good stewards of their tax dollars."

    "gen_response": "Well, I appreciate that question. Let me start by saying that the attacks that took place yesterday, were indeed a heinous act of terrorism. The killing of innocent civilians, and the attempt to intimidate those who are trying to help the people of Iraq, is a clear indication that these terrorists are the enemies of humanity.\n\nAs for who's behind these attacks, I can tell you that our intelligence suggests that these are still remnants of Saddam's regime, as well as some external terrorists, including some from Al-Qaeda, who are trying to disrupt the progress that's being made in Iraq.\n\nRegarding the origin of these attacks, we believe that some of these terrorists are coming from outside the country, but many are also homegrown, taking advantage of safe havens and sympathetic networks within Iraq.\n\nTo stop these attacks, we're working closely with the Iraqi authorities to share intelligence and coordinate our efforts. We're also increasing our support for the Iraqi security forces, helping them to build their capabilities and equipment, so that they can take on a greater role in providing security for their own country.\n\nBut let me be clear, these terrorists will not succeed in their efforts to derail the progress of a free and democratic Iraq. We will continue to work towards the goals that we have set out, which is to establish a democratic government in Iraq, which will be a beacon of hope and stability in the region.\n\nAnd to those who are trying to intimidate the Iraqis and others who are working to rebuild the country, I have this message: we will not be deterred. We will continue to work towards a brighter future for the Iraqi people, and we will not be swayed by these heinous acts of terrorism."

    "gen_response": "Well, I'd like to clarify the context of that event, and I think it's essential to understand what we were trying to communicate at the time. When I stood on the USS Lincoln, I was acknowledging the end of major combat operations, and by that, I meant the major military operations to topple Saddam Hussein's regime had been successful. And I'm proud of what our military accomplished in terms of liberating the Iraqi people from that brutal regime.\n\nNow, regarding the insurgency that has followed, we have always known that there would be a period of stabilization and reconstruction. The attack on Iraq's sovereignty was led by Saddam's forces. When those were removed, I believed we had reached an important milestone.\n\nHowever, we have indeed faced a more complex and intense insurgency than we anticipated. And that has resulted in tragic loss and sacrifice for American troops. My message to the families of those who have lost loved ones or have been wounded is that their sacrifice will not be forgotten, and their service to the cause of freedom will not be in vain.\n\nTo answer your specific question, I do think that we are making progress in stabilizing the country, though there have been setbacks. But I do think we've made significant progress. And while we knew that the aftermath of the fall of Saddam's regime would be challenging, I do not regret communicating our initial optimism that the end of the regime was an important step forward."

It's a testament to the enthusiasm and support that we're seeing out there across the country.\n\nNow, regarding the issue of raising questions and dismissing them as politics, I think it's fair to say that, as a candidate, we're constantly being asked about a wide range of issues, and we've got to prioritize the ones that we think are most important to the American people.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that we're dismissing those questions out of hand. What I am saying is that there's a time and a place for everything. And when it comes to addressing the issues that are facing our country, we've got to be careful not to get caught up in the back-and-forth of the campaign trail.\n\nAs for when the season will start, I think it's fair to say that the season's already underway. But I think what I was trying to say earlier is that there's a certain mindset that comes with the politics of the campaign trail, and we've got to be careful not to let that dominate our thinking.\n\nWe've got to stay focused on the issues that matter to the American people, and we've got to be willing to take the tough questions and answer them in a straightforward and honest way. And I'm committed to doing just that.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I think the public can differentiate between reality and politics by looking at the record, by looking at the plans and the policies that we're putting forward, and by evaluating the leadership that we're showing. And I'm confident that when the American people do that, they'll see that we're a team that's committed to getting the job done for the country."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss our domestic priorities in my second term. As I outlined in my State of the Union address, we've got a lot of work to do to keep this economy growing and to make sure our citizens are equipped to succeed in the 21st century.\n\nFirst, let me say that our number one priority is to strengthen our economy, and that's why we've got to keep taxes low. The tax relief we passed in 2001 and 2003 is set to expire at the end of 2010, and I've made it clear that I will not let those tax cuts expire. We need to make the tax code more rational, more simplified, and more fair. That's why we're going to focus on tax reform.\n\nOur tax system should be fair, progressive, and easy to understand. Americans should spend more time with their families and less time trying to figure out their tax returns. We've got a bipartisan advisory panel that's been working on this issue, and I'm expecting some good recommendations from them soon.\n\nAs for the principles guiding our tax reform proposal, I believe we should strive for a revenue-neutral approach. We should not raise taxes on the American people. We should make sure that we're not shifting the tax burden around, but rather making sure that our tax system is fair and that everyone contributes their fair share.\n\nIn terms of specific principles, we want to simplify the tax code. We want to reduce the complexity and the number of tax brackets. We want to make sure that we're encouraging savings, investment, and job creation. We'll work with Congress to achieve these goals, but I'm optimistic that we can achieve a simple, fair, and pro-growth tax code.\n\nNow, beyond tax reform, we're also committed to improving education. We passed the No Child Left Behind Act in my first term, and we're committed to reauthorizing that bill this year. We'll work with Congress to ensure that every child has access to a quality education and that we're holding schools accountable for results.\n\nIn terms of the sequence of action, I think we'll tackle Social Security reform first. Once we've addressed that issue, we can turn our attention to tax reform and other domestic priorities, including education reform. But make no mistake, all these issues are interrelated. A strong economy, a fair tax system, and a quality education system all contribute to our national prosperity."

I believe that our proposal makes a lot of sense. It's a comprehensive plan that addresses the very real issue of immigration in the United States.\n\nNow, I just had a great meeting with President Fox, and I'm proud to say that our two countries are working closely together to address this issue. We understand that this is a complex problem that requires a comprehensive solution.\n\nTo answer your question directly, I'm willing to expend some political capital on this issue. This is important to me. I believe that this is a vital issue for the future of our country. I believe that having a temporary-worker program will make our borders more secure, and it will provide a careful and wise way for workers to be able to come and go from Mexico in a way that respects our laws.\n\nAs for how to sell it, we're going to do what we always do: we're going to be steady, we're going to be consistent, we're going to be persistent, and we're going to work with members of Congress to address their concerns. We understand that people have concerns, and they should \u2013 this is a complex issue. But I believe that if we present the facts, present our arguments, I think we'll be able to build a coalition of support for this plan.\n\nNow, I'm not one who's shy with my political capital, by the way. I'm willing to spend it. But I'm also willing to listen and try to take as many ideas as I can from members of Congress to make sure that the proposal we're putting forth is the best possible proposal we can do.\n\nSo, we'll continue to work it. We'll continue to explain it. We'll continue to provide the rationale for why this makes sense. And I'm confident that if we put forth a compelling argument, we'll be able to get the necessary support."

The Uzbekistan government has been cooperative with us, and we've had a good relationship.\n\nHowever, we also want to see freedom of the press, and we want to see the treatment of pro-democracy groups treated with respect. And we've made that clear to the Uzbekistan government. We're watching the situation closely, and we'll continue to work with them to make sure that human rights are protected.\n\nNow, on the Egyptian election process, we have been very clear about the importance of having fair and transparent elections. The Egyptian government has taken some steps in the right direction, and we're continuing to encourage them to move forward on democracy and human rights.\n\nNow, we also believe that Egypt is an important partner in the war on terror, and we've worked closely with them on a number of security issues. But our support for Egypt's strategic relationship is not a blank check. And we've made clear to them our expectations about moving forward on democracy.\n\nWe've called upon the Egyptian government to lift the Emergency Law, we've encouraged them to have more freedom for opposition parties, and we've encouraged them to continue to improve the Egyptian election process.\n\nSo, we're working the issue, we're working on the diplomatic channels, and we're going to continue to encourage Egypt to move forward on these important issues.\n\nFreedom is a powerful force, and we're for it, everywhere. And we'll continue to speak out when we see things not going the right way, but we also are going to work with our friends to make sure that we're moving in the right direction together."

First of all, I want to make it very clear that I'm a strong supporter of the FISA process, and we've used it, as you pointed out, many times since we've been in office. In fact, we've used it over 700 times. The FISA process is an important tool in our war on terror.\n\nHowever, in the aftermath of 9/11, we recognized that we were in a unique situation, where we had to move quickly to protect the American people. And so, we took steps to, uh, gather intelligence in a way that would allow us to stop further attacks. And it's these steps that have been, uh, widely reported on.\n\nNow, the National Security Agency, under the authorization of the President - that's me - has been involved in a program that's designed to detect and prevent terrorist attacks. We've been using technology to gather intelligence, and that involves, uh, monitoring communications.\n\nLet me be very clear about one thing: the things we're doing are lawful. They're permitted by the Constitution. We're not predicating crimes on the behalf of the American people, but we do need to be able to gather intelligence to stop further attacks. And so, we've used a process that's, uh, allowed us to have quick action.\n\nI understand that some people might have concerns about the process. I want to assure the American people that we're doing everything we can to protect their civil liberties, while at the same time protecting their safety.\n\nNow, I know that some folks are going to try to make more out of this than there is. But I want the American people to know that we're always doing whatever it takes to protect them, and at the same time, we're working to, uh, ensure that we're achieving our goals and we're not violating the Constitution or the laws of the land.\n\nI think that's a pretty good explanation, don't you think?"

And to achieve that, we believe a sustainable ceasefire is necessary, but it's not just a matter of ending hostilities, it's about making sure that we address the root causes of the problem.\n\nNow, I think you're right that the people of Lebanon want to see houses rebuilt, but they also want to make sure that their government is fully in control of their territory, and that's why the United Nations resolution 1559, which calls for the disbandment of militias, is so important.\n\nThe Israelis have the right to defend themselves, and we support that right, but we're also urging Israel to exercise restraint and to be mindful of civilian casualties. As for the question of whether we think Israel is on the right side of the war on terror, I think it's safe to say that Israel and the United States share a common enemy in terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas.\n\nBut our goal here is not just to allow Israel to win this war. Our goal is for a comprehensive peace, and that means addressing the underlying issues that fuel the conflict. And that's why we're working towards a long-term solution, one that addresses the concerns of all parties involved."

First, regarding the economic situation in the United States, I'd like to emphasize that we're taking proactive steps to address the challenges we're facing. We're experiencing a slowdown, and we're working diligently to stimulate growth and stabilize the markets. It's difficult to predict the exact length and depth of this slowdown, but we're committed to making adjustments as needed.\n\nRegarding Mexico, we value our relationship with our neighbor to the south, and we're working closely with President Calder\u00f3n to ensure that our actions to stabilize the US economy don't negatively impact Mexico's growth. I'm encouraged by President Calder\u00f3n's efforts to reform Mexico's economy and urge Congress to take decisive action to pass meaningful reforms.\n\nNow, regarding security and trade issues: It's essential for us to maintain open lines of communication with our regional partners. Colombia, Ecuador, and other countries in the region are working through the Rio Group to resolve their differences, which we support. The United States remains committed to strengthening the US-Colombia free trade agreement and encourage our friends in Colombia to continue along the path of strengthening democratic institutions and human rights.\n\nAs for NAFTA, we're actively engaged with our partners to ensure this agreement's smooth function and grow. As you well know, this has been an incredibly successful agreement, fostering growth, creating jobs, and fueling new economic prospects across the continent."

We've worked closely with our European allies on issues like counter-terrorism, proliferation, and on the Balkans.\n\nNow, I know that there are differences, and I know that some of our European friends have concerns about our approach on certain issues.

I believe it is a necessary tool for punishing the most heinous crimes, protecting our citizens, and upholding justice.\n\nNow, as President, I have a responsibility to ensure that our justice system is fair and impartial. And that's why I mentioned in my State of the Union address the importance of DNA evidence. This technology can be a powerful tool in helping to exonerate the innocent and convict the guilty.\n\nHowever, I do not believe that the mere existence of potential inequities in the system warrants a blanket moratorium on the death penalty.

We've had some unexpected expenses, like Katrina and the war. However, I believe that we can make some adjustments to pay for those expenses.\n\nSpecifically, I would point to the line-item veto that I'm going to continue to press for, which would give me a little more flexibility to deal with the subtle increases in spending that sometimes sneak into the bills that come out of Congress.\n\nWe also need to see some real entitlement reform. I think that's an area where we can find some savings. We need to fundamentally reform the way we account for expenses in Medicare and Social Security, so that we're not leaving a huge burden on future generations.\n\nIn terms of the tax code, I continue to believe that we should not raise taxes on the American people right now. This is not the right time to take money out of people's pockets. Instead, I think we should consider tax reform that encourages entrepreneurship, and I think we should do it in a way that makes sure the code is fair, but that doesn't raise taxes.\n\nAnd finally, I will say that one thing that will help is we've had a good economy, and a good economy generates more revenue, and we're seeing that right now.

You know, one of the key aspects of our strategy in Iraq is to help the Maliki Government become more self-sufficient, more capable of handling its own affairs. And one way to measure that progress is through the benchmark process.\n\nNow, I've spoken to Prime Minister Maliki about the need for him to make tough decisions, and I believe he's committed to doing so. And we're going to measure his success, and our success, by a range of benchmarks. We're talking about security benchmarks: the ability of the Iraqi security forces to take the lead; the ability of the Iraqi police to keep the peace; the ability of the Iraqi army to extend its reach into places like Anbar Province.\n\nWe're also talking about benchmarks on the reconciliation agenda: the ability of the Iraqis to pass a piece of legislation that says we want to be a unified country, a country that respects the rights of all citizens; the ability to make progress on issues like de-Baathification.\n\nAnd let me tell you, we're also measuring benchmarks in terms of economic progress: the ability to distribute oil revenues equitably; the ability to stand up a new economy that will generate jobs and opportunity for the Iraqi people.\n\nNow, if Prime Minister Maliki fails to meet these benchmarks, the consequences are significant. First and foremost, we'll reassess our strategy and our support for the Iraqi Government. Now, I've talked to Congress about this, I've talked to our international partners about this: we're not going to have a fixed position if the Iraqis don't make progress.\n\nAnd then, of course, there are consequences for the Iraqis themselves. If the Iraqis don't make progress, the violence will likely continue. The sectarian violence will likely continue. And it will be harder and harder for the Iraqi people to achieve their dream of a peaceful, free, and democratic society.\n\nSo, the stakes are high.

We welcome his support for the Iraqi people coming together and building a democratic government.\n\nRegarding the issue of deploying more troops to Iraq, we are constantly assessing the situation on the ground, and our military leaders, General Petraeus and others, are advising us on the best course of action to take. While there are varying opinions on this issue, we are committed to doing what's necessary to help the Iraqi government succeed. The Iraqi people deserve a future of peace, freedom, and prosperity, and we will continue to work with them to achieve that goal.\n\nAs to whether more troops will exacerbate the sectarian divisions, I understand that concern. But I would argue that the sectarian divide is already being exploited by those who seek to destroy the young democracy in Iraq, like al-Qaeda. By providing additional security, particularly in Baghdad, we aim to disrupt and dismantle those who would exploit those divisions.

We've made tremendous progress in disrupting al-Qaeda's operations, dismantling their networks, and taking out their top leaders. But despite our best efforts, bin Laden has proven to be a elusive foe.\n\nHe's hiding in a region that's extremely difficult to operate in \u2013 the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region.

And I think, you know, when you make tough decisions, and I did make some tough decisions, on the war on terror, on taxes, on Social Security, there's gonna be people who are passionate about their disagreement.\n\nNow, as far as Bush Derangement Syndrome, I think it's a pretty clever term, I'll give Charles that. (laughter) I think what Charles was trying to say is that, you know, some people got beyond just disagreeing with me on policy, and it got personal. And, you know, that's just the way it is. I've always believed that, you know, if you're a leader, you got to make decisions, and you've got to be able to take the heat. And I was certainly willing to do that.\n\nNow, to those critics, I would say that, you know, I respect their right to disagree with me. I respect their passion. And I would hope that, you know, they would have a bit more, you know, understanding for the weight of the office and the pressures that come with it. But I'm not gonna change who I am; I'm not gonna change the decisions I made. I'm proud of my record, and I'm proud of what we accomplished.\n\nAnd, you know, I would also say that, you know, sometimes the passions of politics get the best of people. And I've always tried to transcend that, to rise above it. And I hope that, you know, some of those critics might take a step back and reflect on, you know, how they responded to our administration.\n\nBut, you know, all in all, I'm just glad to have had the chance to serve. And I'm glad to have had the chance to be part of a great debate, a great discussion about the future of our country."

I believe in the importance of effective oversight, and I'm committed to ensuring that all our federal agencies, including the FBI, operate with integrity and accountability.\n\nRegarding the issues you mentioned, including the McVeigh matter, the FBI lab issues, and the Hanssen case, I take these incidents very seriously. The FBI, under the leadership of Director Mueller, is already taking steps to address these concerns and implement reforms.\n\nHowever, I also believe that it's essential to strike the right balance between oversight and operational effectiveness. We need to ensure that our law enforcement agencies have the necessary tools and support to do their jobs effectively, while also maintaining the trust of the American people.\n\nAs for a more sweeping look at the FBI, I'm open to exploring options that can help strengthen the agency's capabilities and accountability. I've already met with Director Mueller, and we're working closely together to address these issues.\n\nBut I want to emphasize that the FBI has a critical role in protecting our national security, and I won't let bureaucratic or politicized oversight get in the way of their mission. We'll work with the Senate and the House to ensure that oversight is constructive and focused on strengthening the agency, not undermining it.\n\nUltimately, my commitment is to the American people, and I want to ensure that our agencies are working in their best interests. So, I'm willing to work with Congress to find the right approach, but I also want to make it clear that our national security is my top priority, and I'll do what it takes to keep Americans safe."

On the issue of global warming, I want to emphasize that the United States is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and addressing the serious challenge of climate change. While we appreciate the EU's desire for action, we must take a balanced approach that protects our economy and ensures that developing countries contribute to this effort as well.\n\nRegarding our proposal, we're committed to reducing our emissions intensity by 18% by 2012. We're implementing a number of measures to promote energy efficiency, increase the use of renewable energy, and develop cleaner technologies.\n\nNow, as for going it alone, I've said from the beginning that I'm a coalition builder. I want to work with our friends and allies to address these challenges. However, I'm also not afraid to take the lead on issues where the United States has a vital interest. If necessary, we'll take action to protect our country and our people.\n\nOn the issue of missile defense, I believe that this is a vital security interest not just for the United States, but for our friends and allies in Europe as well. We're not going to back down on this issue. I truly believe that the missile defense system we're proposing is an important part of a broader transatlantic defense strategy that will help to protect us all from rogue nations.\n\nNow, I understand that there are concerns about the system. We're listening to those concerns, we're addressing them, and we're working closely with our allies to ensure that we're taking a cooperative and constructive approach. But I want to be clear: we will not back down from our commitment to defend our country and our people from this threat.\n\nThanks for the question."

It is a bold initiative that presents a hopeful vision, and I applaud the Saudi government for putting it forward.\n\nNow, regarding normalization, I understand that this issue can be complex, and we've seen some movement, some countries are a little more hesitant. I think it's going to take some time, but I am going to stay committed to the idea of full normalization. I do not want to start redefining what the ultimate goal ought to be. The ultimate goal is to have a Middle East that is peaceful, where people are able to get along, where there is a state of Palestine living side by side with the state of Israel in peace.\n\nAnd so, while I understand that we may have some difficulties along the road, I am not one who is willing to start kind of dimming down or reducing the ultimate objective. And the objective is to get normal relations, diplomatic relations, trade relations, economic relations. That what normalizes the relationship in a peaceful way.\n\nNow, the Arabs will have to make decisions based upon their own self-interest. And it's in their interest to have a region that is peaceful. It's in their interest to have a region that is hopeful for the future.\n\nSo I'm optimistic. I still am inclined to believe that we can achieve some progress, real progress in the Middle East, based upon the bold vision put forth by the Saudi Government."

And I'm committed to the process. Now, I understand that the progress toward that goal has been complicated by the... by the fence, by the... other issues, but I don't think we should give up. I think we should keep pushing forward.\n\nI had a good talk with Prime Minister Sharon, he's a man of his word, and I believe he's committed to the process, too. And I think there's a lot of progress being made. We've got a Palestinian prime minister, Abu Mazen, who is committed to peace, who recognizes that the terror must stop. He's working hard to consolidate the security forces under a unified command.\n\nNow, I know it's not going to be easy. I mean, we've seen the outcomes of what happens when there's no control over the security forces. We've seen the resurgence of violence. But I think with patience, with persistence, and with a commitment to the process, I think we can make progress.\n\nAs for the timeframe, you know, the 2005 goal is still a goal, but I... it's not just the date, it's the substance of the deal that matters. What's most important is that we've got a viable Palestinian state that's got a government that's working, that's got security forces that are working, and most importantly, economic progress that will show the Palestinian people that their lives can be improved.\n\nNow, can it be done in '05? I don't know, but I think we should keep pushing for it. I think we should keep working towards it. And I'm going to keep pushing and prodding to make sure that we make as much progress as possible."

And I appreciate their concerns. But I want to assure the American people that our strategy is working. We've got a plan in place that is making progress, and we're making gains on the ground.\n\nNow, I think the capture of Saddam Hussein is a significant milestone in this war on terror, and it deals a serious blow to those who are trying to destabilize Iraq. And I believe that his capture should give the American people confidence that we're moving in the right direction.\n\nNow, I know that there are some who are saying we should change our course. But I believe that would be a mistake. We've made a commitment to the Iraqi people, and we need to see this through. We can't allow terrorists and Baathist elements to dictate the outcome in Iraq. We've got to stay the course, and we will.\n\nAs for my concern about public opinion, I'm not discouraged by what I'm hearing. I understand that there's scepticism out there, but I believe that the American people want to see this mission succeed. They want to see Iraq become a free and stable country, and I believe that they're willing to give us the support we need to see this through.\n\nSo, no, I'm not concerned about public opinion. I'm focused on getting the job done, and I believe that we will succeed in our mission in Iraq."

It's true that some Iraqi security forces haven't performed up to the level that we would have liked, but it's also true that we've seen progress. We've got over 180,000 Iraqis that have volunteered to serve in the security forces, and they are beginning to assert themselves.\n\nNow, as we transition to a more sovereign Iraqi government, we will be working closely with them to provide support. The coalition forces will remain in country to provide a show of force, if you will, to help these Iraqis to continue to become more effective.\n\nBut I want to dispute the notion that we're alone in Iraq. There are over 20 nations that have made a commitment to help the Iraqi people. We've got the United Kingdom with a significant contribution, Italy, Spain \u2013 I mean, there's a lot of countries that are dedicated to helping this young democracy succeed.\n\nNow, we've also got NATO playing a role, and I appreciate the recent announcement of the Secretary General, that NATO will increase its training mission in Iraq. And the UN is playing a role as well. So I reject the notion that we are alone.\n\nNow, the security environment is tough, I'll give you that. But I think we've got a plan in place to make the Iraqi forces more effective. And I think with time, patience, and good leadership, we can make this happen. And we must, because the stakes are high in Iraq. We cannot afford to lose this battle. We must succeed, and I'm confident that we will."

I strongly believe that John Bolton is the right man for the job. He's got a strong record of public service, and he's a man of great integrity and principle.\n\nRegarding the current situation, I understand that we've got a bit of a hurdle in front of us right now with the filibuster. I'm still hopeful that we can persuade some of the senators to change their minds and support John Bolton's nomination.\n\nHowever, as you mentioned, the option of a recess appointment is indeed on the table. I want to emphasize that this is not our first choice, but we will consider it if it becomes necessary. We need a strong, experienced leader like John Bolton at the U.N. to help drive the kind of reforms that we believe are essential for that organization.\n\nAs for the timing, I believe that a recess appointment would give John Bolton sufficient time to make a real impact at the U.N. Even a short time frame can be productive, particularly if he's able to hit the ground running and get to work on the key issues that we've identified.\n\nBut I want to stress that I would prefer to get John Bolton confirmed through the regular process. We'll continue to work with the Senate to try and get that done, but we can't let the work of the American people be held hostage by this process. We need a strong voice for America at the United Nations, and we'll do what it takes to make that happen."

Let me take it one step at a time.\n\nRegarding mainland China's participation in the widening of the Panama Canal, we've made it clear that we expect any country that participates in this project to adhere to certain standards, including respecting the sovereignty of Panama, respecting the rights of Panamanian workers, and abiding by the rule of law. We've had some concerns about China's investment in the region and the labor practices of some Chinese companies. But if China is willing to play by these rules, we're open to their participation.\n\nNow, I want to make it clear that we will always protect the interests of the United States and ensure that our national security is not compromised. We're working closely with the Panamanian government to make sure that the canal remains a secure and important waterway for international trade.\n\nNow, regarding the FTAA summit, I'd say that the divisions that were evident are not a surprise. The countries of MERCOSUR have different visions for the future of the hemisphere, and it's natural that there would be disagreements. But I'm disappointed that the summit didn't make more progress towards creating a more cohesive vision for free trade in the hemisphere.\n\nThe ideological divisions that you referred to are largely about the extent to which the state should intervene in the economy. Some countries in South America, particularly the ones that have been supported by Hugo Chavez's Venezuela, have been advocating for a more protectionist approach, whereas we and other countries in the region believe that a more free market approach is the way to go.\n\nWe'll continue to engage in dialogue with these countries and try to find common ground. We believe that free trade is the key to prosperity in the hemisphere, and we'll keep pushing for an agreement that reflects that vision.\n\nBut make no mistake, we will not compromise our values or our interests in order to get a deal. We'll keep pushing for an agreement that is good for American workers, good for American businesses, and good for the hemisphere as a whole. Thank you."

We believe that the best way to defeat terrorism is to promote democracy, because democracies are peaceful and terrorists can't find safe haven within a democratic society.\n\nRegarding the Palestinian Authority elections, our goal is to help the Palestinian people have free and fair elections. The $2 million we've spent is to help ensure that the Palestinian elections are indeed free and fair. Now, I understand the concern about putting our thumb on the scale, and I want to assure the American people that we're not trying to influence the outcome of the elections. We're trying to help facilitate a peaceful and fair process.\n\nHowever, it's also important to acknowledge that we cannot and will not support a Palestinian government that includes terrorist organizations. We've been very clear with the Palestinian Authority that our support, both financially and in other ways, will depend on their willingness to reject terror and to govern in a peaceful manner.\n\nIt's a delicate balance, but we believe that by supporting democracy and promoting free and fair elections, we're ultimately going to achieve our goal, which is to help the Palestinian people achieve their aspirations for a peaceful and prosperous future."

I've got a bunch of fine, fine people who are serving this country diligently, and we just happen to have a disagreement.\n\nAnd as for a veto, I will veto any bill that doesn't meet the needs of this country's national security. The terrorists have proven themselves to be risk-takers and cunning, and they're always adapting. And we can't give up an important tool, like the ability to interrogate detainees in a way that will help us to save American lives."

I've said publicly, and I believe, that marriage is between a man and a woman. But, I also believe that we can have a more tolerant and compassionate society.\n\nNow, in terms of specific laws and regulations, we've taken a number of steps to ensure that all Americans have equal access to rights and benefits, regardless of their relationships. For instance, the Defense of Marriage Act, which I signed into law, contains provisions that provide certain federal benefits to domestic partners of federal employees.\n\nRegarding hospital visitation rights, I've instructed my Secretary of Health and Human Services to make sure that we're doing everything we can to ensure that visitation rights are provided to individuals, regardless of their relationship status.\n\nI agree that there are other areas where fairness and equality are important. So, I'd be open to listening to proposals that strengthen and change certain laws, to make sure that all Americans are treated with dignity and respect. But, I must reiterate, I still believe in the traditional definition of marriage.\n\nAnd let me make one more thing clear: Vice President Cheney and his wife, Lynne, and Mary Cheney are part of our family, and we love them dearly.

We believe that he has taken important steps to address this issue, including the demobilization of the AUC paramilitary group and the prosecution of those involved in human rights abuses and narco-trafficking.\n\nRegarding extradition, we've made it clear that we believe that those who are involved in narco-trafficking and terrorism should be brought to justice, either in Colombia or in the United States. The US has a longstanding policy of seeking extradition of those who have committed crimes against our citizens or have been involved in narco-trafficking.\n\nHowever, we also recognize that Colombia has made significant progress in building its justice system, and we are working closely with the Colombian government to ensure that they have the capacity to effectively prosecute and bring to justice those who are responsible for these crimes.\n\nUltimately, our goal is to support President Uribe and the Colombian government in their efforts to combat narco-trafficking and terrorism, and to ensure that those who are responsible for these crimes are held accountable. We will continue to work closely with the Colombian authorities to ensure that justice is served.\n\nAnd let me be clear: we expect any government officials who have been involved in narco-trafficking or other corrupt activities to be held accountable, and we will not hesitate to seek extradition if that is necessary."

That being said, we're watching the situation closely, and we're in constant communication with the Pakistani government.\n\nI believe that President Musharraf understands the importance of continuing to pursue the terrorists, particularly along the border with Afghanistan. We're working closely with the Pakistani military to help them increase their capabilities to root out al Qaeda and the Taliban.\n\nDeclaring a state of emergency is, of course, a decision for President Musharraf to make, but we're encouraging him to keep focused on the war on terror and to continue to work with us to ensure that we're making progress in the region.\n\nIt's a tough situation, but I'm confident that President Musharraf's got the abilities to handle it.

We've made it clear that the development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable.\n\nNow, I recognize that the situation with North Korea is a little different, but I believe that our policy of dialogue, as difficult as it may be, is the right policy. We're working with the six-party talks to bring North Korea to the table and to convince them that it's in their best interest to abandon their nuclear programs.\n\nNow, with regards to Iran, we're making it clear that the development of a nuclear program is unacceptable. And we're working with our friends at the United Nations to pass a resolution, a Chapter 7 resolution, that will impose sanctions on Iran if they do not comply with the international community.\n\nI will not say that the policy on North Korea has been exactly right. I will say that we're working hard to make sure that the Iranians don't make progress toward a nuclear weapon. And the point at which we'll draw a line is when we determine that they've made a decision to develop a nuclear weapon. Make no mistake about it, we will not be able to tolerate a nuclear Iran. It's in the interest of world security, it's in the interest of our allies in the region, and it's in the interest of the United States to prevent that from happening.\n\nAnd so we'll work with our friends, we'll work with the international community, and we'll use every tool at our disposal, including diplomatic tools and economic tools, to convince the Iranians to change their behavior.\n\nAnd I must say, I'm not sure that the Iranians are learning the right lesson from North Korea.

However, I also understand that there are concerns about the budget surpluses and the potential risks associated with them.\n\nNow, I'm not willing to negotiate with myself, but I am willing to listen to ideas from Democrats and Republicans alike. What I've proposed is a smart and thoughtful approach, one that will help grow our economy while also providing fiscal discipline.\n\nThat being said, I am open to discussing triggers or mechanisms that can be put in place to ensure that our tax cuts are fiscally responsible. I've always said that I want this tax relief to be pro-growth, fiscally responsible, and fair.\n\nToday, I'm willing to say that we can explore the idea of a trigger mechanism that would limit or slow down the tax cuts if the budget surpluses don't materialize. This would give us a safeguard to ensure that we're not putting our fiscal health at risk.\n\nBut let me be clear: I'm not going to allow the politics of gridlock to undermine our economic growth.

But I believe it's better to be safe than sorry.\n\nAnd so, as the Commander-in-Chief, I not only approved the issuance of the warning, but I think it's an important reminder that we are in a war against terror, that there are people who want to harm us, and that we've got to be vigilant in defending our country.\n\nBut I want to assure the American people, we're doing everything in our power to protect them. We're working closely with our intelligence agencies, we're working closely with our law enforcement agencies, and we're doing everything we can to make sure that America remains a safe and free country.\n\nSo, I would encourage the American people to take this warning seriously, but not to overreact. Go about your business, go about your daily lives, but be aware of the fact that there may be some further threats. And if you see anything that looks suspicious, report it. If you see anything that looks like it might be a threat, report it. We need your help in defending our country. Thank you."

First of all, let me assure the American people that we are committed to the mission in Iraq, and we are making progress. We've got a fine commander on the ground, General Casey, who is getting the job done.\n\nNow, I understand that as commander-in-chief, I've got a lot of people who advise me on various matters, including Iraq. And, yes, we're constantly assessing the situation and considering different perspectives. That's what you want your leaders to do \u2013 to think critically and to challenge assumptions.\n\nNow, as to the memo you're referring to, I think Secretary Rumsfeld has already explained it. And, frankly, I think it's been taken out of context. The memo was a draft, and it wasn't reflective of any Administration policy. But it does reflect the kind of thinking and evaluating that we do on a regular basis.\n\nSo, I want to assure the American people that we're committed to finding a way forward in Iraq that will bring stability and peace to that country, and to the region. And we will continue to do so in a way that's transparent and honest. We'll tell it like it is. We'll report to the Congress on our progress and our challenges. And we'll work with our allies and friends in the region to achieve our goals.\n\nBut make no mistake about it: we're making progress, we're making progress. We'll stay the course, we'll adapt, and we'll complete the mission."

It's a grave threat to the security of our nation and the world. And it's precisely why we've been working with the international community to pressure Iran and North Korea to abandon their nuclear ambitions.\n\nNow, regarding the lessons of Iraq, I want to make it clear that we've learned from that experience. And we're committed to ensuring that our intelligence is accurate, and that we've explored all diplomatic avenues before making any decisions. I've made it clear that our policy towards Iran and North Korea will be guided by a robust and verifiable verification process.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the situation in each country is unique. In the case of Iran, we're working with the international community through the P5+1 negotiations to try to address the concerns about their nuclear program. And in North Korea, we're working through the Six-Party Talks to try to get them to denuclearize.\n\nNow, as Commander-in-Chief, I will always reserve the right to take any action necessary to protect the security of our nation and our allies. But I want to assure the American people and the world that we will exhaust all diplomatic efforts before considering any other options.\n\nAnd finally, I want to make it clear that our goal is not regime change for the sake of regime change. Our goal is to address the threat of nuclear proliferation, and to ensure the security and stability of the region and the world. We'll work tirelessly to achieve that goal through diplomacy, and we'll use all tools at our disposal to achieve it."

The energy bill that we've sent up to Congress is a comprehensive piece of legislation that will help increase domestic production of oil and natural gas, and also promote the development of alternative energy sources like ethanol and nuclear power.\n\nNow, I know the American people are feeling the pain at the pump, and we're feeling it too. And I understand why people want immediate relief. But the fact is, this energy bill, if it were to pass today, would not have an immediate impact on prices. It would take time for some of the provisions in the bill to take effect.\n\nHowever, if we act quickly, we can begin to make progress on increasing domestic production and reducing our dependence on foreign oil, which would help to put downward pressure on prices over the long term. It's also worth noting that many experts believe that simply the prospect of this legislation becoming law can have an impact on the oil markets, and potentially help to bring prices down.\n\nNow, no one's pretending that this is a magic solution to the problem. But it's a crucial step towards reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and increasing the supplies of energy we have here at home. We've got to stay focused on the long-term picture here.\n\nAnd let me just say one other thing: The Democrat leadership in Congress has been slow to move on this bill, and I urge them to pass it. We can't afford to wait any longer. We've got a problem, and we need a solution."

Let me be clear: I do not believe, and I never have believed, that the President is above the law. That's just not how our system of government works.\n\nWhat I am sayin' is that, as Commander-in-Chief, the President has a solemn duty to protect this country and its citizens. And in times of war, that duty requires takin' certain actions that may not be appropriate in peacetime.\n\nNow, I know some folks have said that my position is similar to President Nixon's, but I think that's a misunderstanding. President Nixon's comment was about the idea that the President is essentially above the law, that he can do whatever he wants and it's automatically legal. That's not what I believe, and that's not what I've ever said.\n\nWhat I've said is that, as President, I have a responsibility to take actions that are necessary to protect this country, even if they may not be popular or may not be easy. And I've also made clear that those actions will be taken in a way that's consistent with the law and with our values as a nation.\n\nI think there's a big difference between sayin' that the President is above the law and sayin' that the President has a responsibility to take difficult actions in times of war. And I think it's a crucial distinction, one that gets at the heart of our system of government and our commitment to the rule of law.\n\nSo, I hope that helps clarify things. I'm happy to take more questions."

However, I would argue that the spending we've done has been necessary to address our national security needs, particularly in the wake of 9/11 and the ongoing War on Terror. We've had to make some tough choices to ensure the safety and security of the American people.\n\nNow, I know that the debt has increased during my time in office, but I believe that our economy has also shown remarkable resilience and growth. Tax revenues have increased, and our economy is strong. I believe we're on a path to reduce the deficit, and I'm committed to continuing to work with Congress to get our fiscal house in order.\n\nRegarding the decision not to veto bills, I've chosen to work with Congress on these issues. While I don't agree with every aspect of every bill, I've believed it's more constructive to work collaboratively to find common ground rather than resorting to vetoes. But I assure you, we're taking the debt seriously and are committed to finding a balanced approach to addressing our fiscal responsibilities.\n\nIt's worth noting that the 58-percent increase you mentioned is spread over four years, and in the context of our overall economy and growth, we believe we have the capacity to manage this debt. I'm committed to continuing to explore ways to reduce the deficit and put our country on a path towards fiscal responsibility."

And, as you've pointed out, that didn't happen, at least not as quickly as we had hoped.\n\nI think the Prime Minister was acknowledging that perhaps we were overly optimistic, that the task of building a stable, thriving democracy in Iraq would be more difficult and more time-consuming than we anticipated. I share that assessment.\n\nHowever, I want to emphasize that I still believe the decision to remove Saddam Hussein was the right one. He was a brutal dictator, a sponsor of terror, and a threat to the stability of the Middle East. And the fact that the Iraqi people now have the chance to build a free and prosperous society is a testament to the bravery and determination of our troops and to the people of Iraq themselves.\n\nWe have made progress in Iraq, despite the difficulties and despite the setbacks. We've seen the Iraqi people go to the polls three times, we've seen a constitution drafted and ratified, and we've seen the Iraqi security forces begin to take on greater responsibility for the security of the country.\n\nSo, while we may have been overly optimistic about the pace of progress, I still believe that we are on the right path, and that with continued support and commitment from the international community, including from our British allies, we can help the Iraqi people build a brighter future for themselves."

We are facing a determined enemy that is using brutal tactics to try and undermine the Iraqi government and the Iraqi people. But we are not going to be deterred. We are going to stay the course, and we are going to help the Iraqis achieve their goal of a democratic society.\n\nGeneral Casey is doing a fine job as commander of the Multinational Force in Iraq, and I have every confidence in his judgment and his leadership.

But let me tell you what I believe we've accomplished so far. We've removed a brutal dictator, Saddam Hussein, from power, and given the Iraqi people the chance to build a new, democratic future.\n\nWe've also made significant progress in the fight against terrorism. Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups have been dealt a significant blow, and we've dismantled many of their networks and operational capabilities.\n\nNow, I know that the situation in Iraq remains challenging, and we've faced setbacks and difficulties along the way. But I believe that our strategy is working, and that we're making progress towards our goal of a stable, democratic Iraq that can govern itself and defend itself.\n\nRegarding your comment that the United States has brought terrorism to Iraq, I strongly disagree. Saddam Hussein's regime was a terrorist regime, and it was a haven for terrorists. We've actually made Iraq a less hospitable place for terrorists, and we've made it more difficult for them to operate.\n\nAs for the Iraqi people being the biggest losers, I understand that the Iraqi people have suffered greatly, and that the violence and instability in their country have caused them immense hardship. But I believe that we're working towards a brighter future for the Iraqi people, one in which they can live in peace and security, and build a better life for themselves and their families.\n\nIn the next three years, I expect to see continued progress towards our goals in Iraq. I expect to see the Iraqi security forces become increasingly capable of taking the lead in securing their country, and I expect to see the Iraqi government become increasingly effective in delivering basic services and improving the lives of its citizens.\n\nI also expect that we'll continue to work to isolate and defeat the terrorist networks that are seeking to undermine Iraq's progress, and that we'll make significant strides towards a more stable and secure region.\n\nNow, I know that there will be challenges ahead, and that we'll face setbacks along the way.

I'm a strong supporter of a compassionate and humane immigration policy. And the fact that I signed the Secure Fence Act was not to send a message that Latin Americans are not welcome. No, that's not the message at all.\n\nThe message was that we want to have a humane immigration policy, that we want to have compassion, that we want to make sure that people who are employing people who are in our country are employing people who are here legally.

We believe that it's in the interest of the American people, and I've been very upfront with Vladimir about our intentions.\n\nNow, I understand there are some issues. The Russians are concerned about the positioning of the radar, and that's an issue we're willing to work on. We believe the system is not a threat to Russia. It's a system designed to protect against threats from other places in the world. And so we'll see. We'll see if we can find common ground. I'm optimistic we can.\n\nRegarding NATO, we're committed to the Membership Action Plan for Ukraine and Georgia. We think these are important countries that need to be part of the community of democracies. We're helping them to meet the requirements, to reform their militaries, to reform their governments, and we're committed to that. We're going to push for it.\n\nNow, I wouldn't rule out the idea that, you know, as you find common ground on one issue, you might be willing to listen on another.

But I've also said that this is a performance-based process. If Saddam Hussein disarms, then he can stay in power. If he chooses not to disarm, then he's got a problem, and we'll deal with him in a way that we see fit.\n\nAs for the frequency or the forcefulness of our response, I will tell you this \u2013 we will respond to threats as we see them. We will not take any options off the table. We will use our military power in a way that is commensurate with the threat that we perceive.\n\nSo, make no mistake about it \u2013 we're serious about this.

However, I've been assured by our military commanders that we're working hard to improve our targeting capabilities, and that we're learning from our experiences in the field.\n\nAs for the remaining installations that were missed, I'm told that they still pose a danger to our forces, but we're working to mitigate that threat through a combination of military action and other means. I'm not at liberty to discuss the details of our operational plans, but I can tell you that we're taking a careful and deliberate approach to this situation.\n\nIf commanders in the field were to request authorization for further airstrikes, I would certainly consider their recommendations. As Commander-in-Chief, it's my duty to provide our troops with the support they need to accomplish their mission safely and effectively.

However, let me tell you, I believe there is a connection, and it's not just a matter of a direct linkage.\n\nSaddam Hussein is a man who is a supporter of terror. He has been for a long time, and he has provided financing and support to organizations that seek to harm America, our allies, and his neighbors. The fact is, Saddam has a very long record of dangerous behavior, including the development of and possession of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nNow, I know there's debate about the exact nature of the linkage between Saddam and Al Qaida. But let me tell you, this is not just about a direct connection between Saddam and Osama bin Laden. This is about the broader danger that Saddam poses, and the threat that his regime poses to the region and to the world.\n\nAnd I would say to our European friends that we're not simply talking about a hypothetical situation here. We're talking about a regime that has consistently demonstrated its willingness to disregard the United Nations, to ignore the demands of the international community, and to place its own interests above those of its neighbors and the world at large.\n\nSo, while I understand that there may be some differences of opinion on the exact nature of the linkage between Saddam and Al Qaida, I believe that we are right to take the threat that Saddam poses very seriously, and to take action to address that threat.

I believe that we have a moral obligation to ensure that every American has access to opportunity, regardless of their background or the color of their skin.\n\nNow, I know that we've had some setbacks, particularly in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

We must confront the legacy of slavery, segregation, and racism that still haunts our nation today.\n\nRegarding the comments made by Secretary Bennett, I was troubled by them. Those comments were unacceptable, and they do not reflect the values of our party or of our country. We must strive for a level of discourse that is civil and respectful, even when we disagree.\n\nNow, on the question of how the Republican Party can earn the trust of more African American voters, I believe that it's a question of policy and of leadership. We need to demonstrate that we are committed to the values of equality, justice, and opportunity that are shared by African Americans, and that our policies reflect that commitment.\n\nWe've made some progress in this area, with initiatives such as the Faith-Based Initiative, the Education Bill, and the African American Outreach. But we have more work to do. We need to engage with African American leaders, listen to their concerns, and develop policies that address the specific challenges that they face.\n\nI believe that if we lead with integrity, compassion, and a commitment to justice, we can earn the trust of more African American voters, and build a more inclusive and diverse party that reflects the best of America.\n\nThank you."

We are working on the issue of energy independence, and I believe our proposal to accelerate the development of alternative fuels, such as ethanol, is a step in the right direction.\n\nRegarding the need for an emergency energy summit, I think we need to consider that option. I'm willing to sit down with members of Congress, with experts in the field, and with the CEOs of major energy companies to discuss this issue.\n\nHowever, I also want to emphasize that the problem of energy independence is a complex one. It's not just about symbolic actions or Summit. We need a comprehensive, long-term approach. We've already taken some steps, such as increasing funding for research and development of alternative energy sources.\n\nIn terms of making it a higher priority, I think it already is a high priority for my administration. We understand the urgency of this issue. But what I think the American people need to know is that we're working on it, and we're committed to making progress.\n\nNow, I know that the American people are impatient, and I am too. But I want to assure them that we're doing everything in our power to address this issue. We're working on increasing refining capacity, we're working on conservation efforts, and we're working on alternatives. And I'm hopeful that we can make some progress in the months ahead."

I think it's essential for our justice system to run its course and for all individuals to be held accountable for their actions.\n\nAs for my assessment of Mayor Daley, I've always believed in praising people when they do good work, and Mayor Daley has done some good work in the city of Chicago. However, I also believe that when there are allegations of wrongdoing, they ought to be thoroughly investigated, and if there's wrongdoing, people should be held accountable.\n\nSo, I still think that Mayor Daley has done some good things, but I also believe in the importance of a fair and impartial justice system, and if that system finds wrongdoing, then actions should be taken accordingly."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for that question. As I was sayin', we need to make sure our workers have the skills necessary to compete in the 21st century. And I believes strongly that we can do that through various programs, like the Workforce Investment Act, which will help train and educate our workers for the jobs of the future.\n\nNow, when it comes to small businesses, I know they're the backbone of our economy. They're the ones who create the jobs, who innovate, who take the risks. And we need to make sure we're givin' 'em the tools they need to succeed. That's why I'm proposin' targeted tax and regulatory relief, to help 'em reduce their costs, to help 'em grow and hire more workers.\n\nNow, I know some folks might say, \"How can we afford this, given the cost of the war on terrorism?\" And I understand that concern. But let me tell you, we can't afford not to do this. We need to invest in our workers, in our small businesses, because that's how we're gonna grow our economy, that's how we're gonna create jobs. And besides, we're already runnin' a deficit, but we're also seein' signs of economic growth.\n\nAnd let me tell you somethin' else. We're not talkin' about givin' out blank checks. We're talkin' about targeted relief, relief that's aimed directly at the areas that need it most. So, we're gonna be fiscally responsible, but we're also gonna be forward-lookin', makin' sure we're set up for success in the long term.\n\nAnd I gotta say, I'm optimistic about our economy. I'm optimistic about the American people. We're a resilient bunch, and we're gonna get through this tough time, and we're gonna come out stronger on the other side. Thank you."

    "gen_response": "Well, thank you for the question. I'll try to address both parts of it. \n\nFirst off, I don't feel betrayed. I mean, I think it's natural for people who've worked in the administration to have differing opinions, and I respect that. We had a team of folks who worked hard to make tough decisions, and sometimes we didn't see eye to eye. That's okay. I think it's healthy to have diverse perspectives, and if some folks have criticisms after the fact, I respect that.\n\nNow, regarding Chairman Greenspan's criticisms, I'm a little disappointed that he's spoken out. But I understand that's his right, and I respect his service to the country. As for his specific criticisms about my fiscal policies, I think it's quite simplistic to say that the problem was just too much spending or too many tax cuts.\n\nWe faced a very different economic environment when we came into office \u2013 the dot-com bubble had burst, and the economy was slowing down. We took actions that we believed were necessary to stimulate economic growth and job creation, including the tax cuts. And I think it's hard to deny that the economy did experience a period of growth and expansion after we implemented those policies.\n\nHowever, I will say that I do take some issue with Chairman Greenspan's timing. If he had concerns about the fiscal direction of the country, I wish he had spoken up more forcefully while he was still in office. Nevertheless, I appreciate the efforts he made to support our economic policies at the time, and I think his legacy on monetary policy is a distinguished one.\n\nUltimately, as President, I had to make a lot of tough decisions, and I tried to do what I thought was right for the country. I can live with the fact that not every single one of my former officials or advisors agrees with those decisions."

We've made significant progress against them, and we've taken out some of their top leaders. That being said, I would caution against saying we're close to declaring victory just yet.\n\nYou see, this is a complex and dynamic situation, and it's not just a matter of defeating Al Qaida in Iraq militarily. We're also working to build a stable and secure Iraq, where the Iraqi people can govern themselves and live in peace. And that's a long-term process.\n\nNow, I understand that some of my critics may say we can't win this war militarily. But I disagree. I believe that our military is making progress, and we're doing so in a responsible and measured way. We're working with the Iraqi security forces to train them up, to mentor them, and to help them take on a greater role in the fight against Al Qaida.\n\nWe're also working through diplomatic channels to build consensus among the Iraqi factions, to encourage reconciliation and to promote stability. And we're working with our allies, like the Iraqi government and other international partners, to address the underlying causes of the conflict.\n\nSo, while I wouldn't say we're close to declaring victory just yet, I am confident that we're making progress. And I believe that our military efforts, combined with our diplomatic efforts, are the right way forward to achieve our goals in Iraq.\n\nAnd let me be clear: our mission in Iraq is to succeed. We will not be deterred by the challenges we face, and we will not be swayed by the critics who say we can't win. We will continue to work tirelessly, to adapt to changing circumstances, and to stay focused on our goals. And I'm confident that, in the end, we will emerge victorious."

We believe it's essential to provide relief to those who need it most, while also maintaining the stability of the financial system.\n\nBeyond that, we're looking at a range of options to stimulate economic growth and address the current slowdown. We're considering proposals to boost consumer confidence, support small businesses, and encourage investment in key sectors.

Now, I'm not an expert, but I do rely on the experts, and I think we're finding more oil, and we're using technology to extract more oil, not only here at home but around the world.\n\nNow, I'm not sure I agree with the assessment that we're close to tapping out. I think we've still got a lot of capacity to find and extract oil. However, I do agree with you that we need to have a comprehensive energy strategy that includes not only fossil fuels but also alternative energy.\n\nAnd that's why I'm proud to say that we've increased our investment in renewable energy research by about 27 percent. We're working on hydrogen fuel cells, wind, solar, you name it \u2013 we're working on it.\n\nAnd I think that's important, and we'll continue to do so. It's a necessary step for our country to become less dependent on foreign oil, and we're making progress.\n\nAnd I would argue that our energy policy, which is a comprehensive policy that includes a lot of good ideas, is being implemented. And I'm proud of the work that's being done by the Energy Department and other agencies.\n\nNow, could we do more? I'm sure there are more things we could do. But I think we're making good progress, and we'll continue to do so.\n\nBut it's also important for the American people to understand that as we move forward on energy independence, we can't just rely on one source of energy. We need an all-of-the-above approach \u2013 we need to explore, we need to extract, we need to conserve, and we need to use new technologies to bring new energy sources to the table."

I think the question about climate change was meant for the Prime Minister of Finland, not me, but I'll answer the first part of the question.\n\nRegarding Iran and the debate in Israel, I've always said that the United States, and I believe the international community, wants Iran to be a part of the international system, but not at the expense of undermining the security of countries in the region. Israel is a very close friend of the United States. We've had a long-standing relationship, and we will continue to work with Israel to make sure that the security concerns are addressed.\n\nThe United States has made it clear that a nuclear Iran is unacceptable. I've made that clear. I've worked with our European friends and the United Nations to try to get Iran to understand that it's in their best interest to abandon their nuclear weapons program.\n\nAnd, of course, we'll work with Israel to make sure that they feel secure in the region. I'll stop there. I don't want to get into a hypothetical debate about what Israel's policies might or might not be. Our position on Iran's nuclear program is very clear, and we'll continue to work with the international community, including Israel, to address this issue.\n\n(pauses, turns to the Prime Minister of Finland)\n\nMr. Prime Minister, I think you've got a question coming your way."

    "gen_response": "Well, thank you for that question. First, let me say I'm glad to see some progress in Iraq, and I appreciate the efforts of our allies in North Korea to address some of the concerns that led to that designation.\n\nNow, if I were to update the axis of evil list today, I would include extremist groups who seek to harm American interests and our allies. I'm talking about al-Qaeda and its affiliates, who have shown time and time again a willingness to attack innocent civilians. I'd include countries like Syria and Iran, who continue to support these extremist groups, and who pursue nuclear programs that threaten the stability of the region.\n\nAnd let's be clear: the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs pose a serious threat to the safety of the free world.\n\nAs for the greatest and most urgent threat, I think it's clear that terrorism, in all its forms, is still the greatest threat to our national security. You've got these extremist groups who seek to attack us, and we've got to stay vigilant.\n\nBut if I had to identify a specific threat that requires immediate attention from President Obama, I'd say it's the likes of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, who have shown a willingness to attack us and our allies in the region.\n\nNow, I believe the war in Afghanistan is a key part of this fight, and we've got to continue to work with our allies to disrupt and dismantle these extremist networks. And let's not forget, we've also got to address the situation in Pakistan, where these extremist groups are seeking to destabilize the region.\n\nSo, in short, I think terrorism remains the greatest threat, and al-Qaeda and its affiliates are the ones we've got to stay most vigilant about."

The U.S. had been providing assistance to Peru in their efforts to interdict aerial trafficking of narcotics, but it's clear that there was a terrible mistake made in this case.\n\nWhile our spotter plane did identify the missionaries' aircraft, it's Peru's Air Force that took the lethal action. However, we recognize that our participation in the broader counter-narcotics effort in the region may have contributed to the circumstances that led to this tragic event.\n\nWe're committed to fully cooperating with Peru in the investigation and to determining exactly what went wrong. We'll also be conducting an internal review of our own procedures to ensure that we do everything we can to prevent such a terrible mistake from happening again in the future.\n\nMy administration takes the safety of American citizens very seriously, and we will do everything in our power to prevent such a tragedy from occurring again."

Director Freeh is a man of great integrity, and I respect his decision to retire after many years of public service."

It was tough, but you've got to remember, I'm a loyal son, and I was there for him. (pauses for a moment)\n\nAs for yesterday's conversation, I think it's fair to say we talked about the weight of the presidency, and the lessons he's learned over the years. He offered some sage advice, but I'll keep that between us, at least for now. (chuckles)\n\nRegarding the second term, I do feel a sense of freedom to tackle some tough issues that we may have been hesitant to address in the first term. Now, I don't want to suggest that we were constrained by politics in the first term, but there's no doubt that re-election considerations can influence the way you govern.\n\nOne area where I feel more free to act is on Social Security reform. It's a tough issue, and we know it's not going to be easy, but we've got to address it. I think, in a second term, we can push the politics aside and focus on finding a solution that's good for America. (leans in) Now, don't get me wrong, we're not going to try to cram through some ideological agenda, but we will be bold, and we will take some risks to address the big challenges facing this nation.\n\nAnd, of course, we're also looking to make some changes in the tax code, to make sure that it's fair and that it's promoting economic growth. We'll be looking to reform some of the entitlement programs, and make sure that we're living within our means as a nation.\n\nSo, while there's not a single issue that we're going to tackle just because we're in a second term, I do feel a sense of freedom to be more bold, and to take on some of the tougher challenges that face this nation."

But I believe it's more than that. It's about sitting down with the Democratic leadership, listening to their concerns, and finding areas where we can work together.\n\nI've made it a point to reach out to the Democratic leadership, to listen to their ideas, and to work with them on a wide range of issues. Whether it's on education reform, or Social Security reform, or tax reform, I believe that we can find common ground and work together to get things done.\n\nNow, I know we're not going to agree on everything. That's the nature of democracy. But I believe that by working together, we can find solutions that benefit the American people, regardless of party affiliation.\n\nAnd let me give you an example. On the education reform bill, we worked closely with Senator Kennedy and Congressman Miller to craft a bill that would improve our nation's schools and help our children succeed. And I'm proud to say that it was a bipartisan effort that passed with strong support from both parties.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I believe that bipartisanship is not just about picking off a few Democrats on a case-by-case basis.

    "gen_response": "Good morning to you as well. I appreciate the question. Let me start by saying that our concerns about Iran's nuclear program are rooted in the fact that we cannot trust the regime in its current form. The Iranian leadership has consistently demonstrated that it is not interested in being a responsible player on the world stage, and its pursuit of nuclear capabilities is a threat not just to the region, but to the entire world.\n\nIn terms of what we might be willing to accept, let me be clear: we will not stand idly by while Iran develops a nuclear weapons capability. We are working closely with our international partners to find a diplomatic solution that would bring Iran into compliance with its international obligations, including the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\nHowever, if Iran were to demonstrate a commitment to transparency, to cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and to abandoning its pursuit of nuclear weapons, we would be willing to consider a civilian nuclear power program that is subject to strict international safeguards. But let me be clear: this is not a concession, and it's not a guarantee. Iran must earn the trust of the international community, and it must demonstrate that it is willing to be a responsible player.\n\nRegarding the second part of your question, we have made it clear that we support the Iranian people in their aspirations for democracy and freedom. We have taken steps to support the Iranian dissident community, and we will continue to consider ways in which we can support those who are working towards democratic reform in Iran. However, let me also be clear: the United States will not be a party to any efforts that would seek to impose regime change by force or coercion. Our goal is to support the Iranian people in their peaceful efforts to bring about democratic reform, and we will continue to work with our international partners to find ways in which we can support those efforts.\n\nBut I want to be clear: our support for the Iranian people is not a euphemism for regime change. We are not in the business of picking winners and losers in Iran. Our goal is to support the democratic aspirations of the Iranian people, and we will continue to work towards that end in a responsible and measured way."

As for Scott McClellan, Scott McClellan is a fine individual, did a fine job for us, and I appreciate his service.

It's gotta be a force that's capable of making sure that the bad guys can't stir up trouble. And I think that Turkey and Italy have been very forward-leaning in their desire to help. I think it's very interesting that two of America's strong allies, or, at least, allies of the United States, in the neighborhood and in NATO, respectively, are willing to take the lead. And we're working with other nations, as well \u2013 France, to a certain extent, although we haven't pinned down France's participation yet.\n\nAs for Hizballah, I think it's very important that Hizballah be neutralized, one way or the other. And, of course, that's a subject of ongoing diplomatic discussions, and military planning. And, as the Prime Minister said, the key is to have a resolution that can bring a cessation of hostilities. And, we don't want to see people being killed needlessly, day after day in the Middle East.\n\nIn terms of an immediate cease-fire, I'm a bit skeptical, because I think that an immediate cease-fire doesn't necessarily make the situation in the region better. What I want to see is a lasting peace. I want to see a peace that's sustainable. And so, while agreeing to an immediate cease-fire might seem appealing, I'm not sure that's the right way to go, at least, from my perspective, so, it needs to be carefully thought through.\n\nIn terms of systemic solutions to this conflict, we also need to address issues that make Lebanon strong, you know, empowering its institutions and its army. We need, also, to do something, to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, here. And so, these are \u2013 we're talking about a program, a big sweep of agreement."

I fully believe that the long-term results will vindicate our strategy.\n\nWe're making progress in Iraq, despite the difficulties we face.

I've always believed in seeking advice from wise people and considering various perspectives. That's why I've asked for input from the Pentagon, the State Department, and others.

Matter of fact, I think a healthy debate will help keep us focused on the task at hand, which is to help the Iraqi government achieve victory over these terrorists and to train the Iraqi security forces to be able to defend themselves.\n\nRegarding briefing the candidates, I think that's a decent idea. I'd be more than happy to have our national security team brief the candidates on the ground situation in Iraq, as well as our strategy going forward.

The Iranian government must understand that its refusal to cooperate with the IAEA and its defiance of Security Council resolutions will only lead to increased isolation.\n\nNow, regarding sanctions, I do believe that tough UN sanctions with real teeth are necessary to get the attention of the Iranian government. The United States is working closely with our allies and partners at the UN to draft a strong resolution that holds Iran accountable for its actions.\n\nAs for Russia and China, I am confident that they will join us in supporting tough sanctions. Both countries have expressed concerns about Iran's nuclear program, and I believe they will see that it's in the best interest of regional stability and security to support a strong UN resolution.\n\nWe will continue to work with our partners to build a united international front to address this crisis, and I'm optimistic that we can find a peaceful solution that prevents Iran from developing nuclear capabilities.

    "gen_response": "I appreciate that question, and I'm happy to provide some clarification. Now, let me be clear: we know that Saddam Hussein had a long history of supporting terrorism, and we know that he had ties to terrorist organizations, including Al Qaeda.\n\nNow, with regard to the specific attacks in Iraq, we have reason to believe that Al Qaeda in Iraq, also known as Zarqawi's organization, is indeed affiliated with Usama bin Laden. We've got information that suggests they've got connections to each other, and we're continuing to work to disrupt those connections.\n\nAs for the evidence, we've had multiple reports from various sources, including interrogations of senior Al Qaeda leaders, that suggest a link between Saddam's regime and Al Qaeda. Now, I know some folks have questioned the nature of those links, but I can tell you that we take that intelligence very seriously.\n\nNow, I'm not suggesting that Saddam Hussein was directly responsible for the 9/11 attacks. But what I am saying is that Saddam's regime did have a history of supporting terrorist organizations, including Al Qaeda. And we believe that by taking him down, we've disrupted those connections and made America safer.\n\nAs for Zarqawi, we know he's a bad guy, and we know he's got connections to Al Qaeda. And we're going to keep working to bring him to justice. We're making progress in Iraq, but it's not going to be easy, and it's not going to be quick. But we're committed to seeing this through, and we're committed to protecting the American people.\n\nNow, I know there are still some who question the connection between Saddam and Al Qaeda. I understand that. But I can tell you that our intelligence community has worked hard to get to the bottom of this, and we believe that the evidence suggests a link. We're going to keep working to build on that intelligence and to root out terrorist organizations wherever they are.\n\nThat's all I can say on that for now."

In terms of the infrastructure needs of our country, we do have a significant challenge before us. However, I've always been a bit skeptical of increasing federal gasoline taxes. I believe we have a responsibility to be good stewards of the taxpayer's dollar, and I think there may be other ways to address this issue.\n\nNow, I'm not opposed to taking a fresh look at the issue, and I'm willing to work with Congress to find a solution. But I also think we need to be mindful of the impact any tax increase would have on working Americans and the overall economy. We need to make sure we're not burdening our citizens with unnecessary taxes.\n\nInstead, we should consider a more comprehensive approach that incorporates a range of funding options, perhaps including, for example, increased efficiency in government spending or leveraging the private sector. There may also be opportunities to tie infrastructure funding to reforms in the way we manage and prioritize our transportation programs."

We're making progress, but I don't want to give you a specific deadline just yet.\n\nWhat I can say is that we're committed to making it easier for Romanians to travel to the United States, and we're exploring ways to streamline our visa application process. We're working closely with the Romanian government to address these issues, and we appreciate their cooperation.\n\nI'll make a commitment to you that we'll work hard to make progress on this issue, but I'm not ready to give you a specific deadline just yet. I will, however, ask Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to continue to work closely with the Romanian government to find ways to improve travel between our two nations. We value our relationship with Romania, and we want to make it easier for our citizens to visit each other's countries.\n\nAnd I might add, we're also making progress on the issue of Romania's admission to the Visa Waiver Program. We're working closely with the Romanian government to ensure that they meet the requirements of the program, and I'm optimistic that we can make progress on this front in the near future."

You know, I've been very clear with the Congress about what we need to get the job done in Iraq, and that's what the supplemental's purpose is. Now, I've also said that I'm open to other ideas, but we've got to be mindful of the costs.\n\nRegarding extending unemployment benefits, I think that's an idea worth discussing. We want Americans who are looking for work to have the support they need during these uncertain times. However, we've also got to make sure we're not creating a new entitlement program that we can't afford.\n\nWhen it comes to our veterans, I'm a big supporter of our troops, and I want to make sure we're taking care of them when they come home. Now, I haven't seen the specific language, but I'm willing to consider additional support for our veterans, especially when it comes to education benefits. Those men and women have served our country with honor, and we've got a responsibility to help them achieve their goals.\n\nNow, I will say that I'm still committed to the $108 billion number. We can't just keep adding and adding without considering the fiscal implications. We can do some good things within that framework, and I'm willing to work with the Congress to find ways to support our veterans and those Americans looking for work. But we've got to be fiscally responsible, too.\n\nSo, I'm open to discussions, but we've got to make sure we're not just throwing money around without thinking about the consequences. That's not responsible leadership, and that's not what the American people expect from us."

As we gather here today in Genoa, I want to emphasize the importance of global cooperation in addressing the economic challenges that we're all facing. \n\nWe are committed to working closely with our G-7 partners to promote economic growth and stability around the world. We recognize that there are risks to the global economy, and we will be discussing those risks and the steps that each of our countries can take to address them. We will be urging our partners to adopt policies that promote economic growth, including reducing barriers to trade and investment, and increasing investment in education and infrastructure.\n\nRegarding the strong U.S. dollar, I will be discussing this issue with our G-7 partners here in Genoa. We believe that market forces should be allowed to determine exchange rates, but at the same time, we are monitoring the situation closely and are prepared to take action if it becomes necessary to support global economic growth.\n\nI would like to hear from Prime Minister Blair on the steps that Europe is taking to stimulate the global economy, and I am sure that he will want to address this question directly.

Let me be clear: corporate corruption is not just a matter of justice; it's also a matter of national security and economic security. As I said before, 9/11 taught us that we must confront threats before they materialize, and corporate corruption is no exception.\n\nIn response to the scandals we've seen, we're taking several steps to strengthen investor confidence and prevent future abuses. First, we've proposed and signed into law the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which enhances disclosure requirements and provides tough new penalties for corporate wrongdoers.\n\nSecond, we're working with the Securities and Exchange Commission to improve disclosure requirements and strengthen enforcement. The SEC is now more empowered to pursue wrongdoers and ensure accountability.\n\nThird, our administration is committed to improving corporate governance. We believe that boards of directors must be independent, and we're encouraging companies to adopt best practices in this regard.\n\nFourth, we're working to improve transparency and disclosure, to make sure investors have the information they need to make informed decisions.\n\nFinally, we're encouraging the culture of corporate responsibility to spread throughout our business community. Corporate America must recognize that its social compact with the American people requires a commitment to integrity, transparency, and accountability.\n\nTo the investors across the country, I say this: we're committed to creating an environment where you can trust your investments, where you can be confident that the rules are being followed, and where corporate America is working to uphold the highest standards of integrity and responsibility."

We're working with the international community to resolve this peacefully, but as I've said, I'm not optimistic that Saddam Hussein will change his ways.\n\nIf the resolution is passed, we'll be working with our allies to enforce the will of the United Nations. If it's not passed, we'll be working with our allies to enforce our own national interests. Either way, our goal is the same: to disarm Saddam Hussein and make sure he doesn't pose a threat to his neighbors or to the world.\n\n(Leaning forward slightly) Now, I don't want to speculate about the prospects of going to war. I hope that can be avoided, but I will not rule it out. The American people, the Congress, and our allies expect us to defend our national interests, and we will do just that.\n\n(Pausing, looking around the room) I think it's clear that we're at a critical moment.

As you know, the transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqi government is a significant milestone, and it's a testament to the progress we're making in Iraq. Now, regarding Saddam Hussein, we're certainly open to discussions with the Iraqi government about the transfer of custody.\n\nHowever, I want to make it clear that our primary concern is ensuring that Saddam Hussein is held accountable for his crimes, and that justice is served. We're weighing the ability of the Iraqi justice system to meet international standards of fairness and due process, as well as the potential risks and security implications of transferring custody.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Saddam Hussein is being held under a UN Security Council resolution that calls for him to be brought to justice by an Iraqi-led process. We're committed to supporting the Iraqi government in their efforts to bring Saddam Hussein to justice.\n\nRegarding Usama bin Laden and Mullah Omar, our position remains unchanged - we will pursue them and bring them to justice, wherever they may be. As for who will try them, that's a matter that's still being determined. However, I can assure you that we're working closely with our allies and partners to ensure that these individuals are held accountable for their crimes.\n\nUltimately, our goal is to see justice served, and we're exploring all available options to achieve that goal."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for that question. It's a very astute observation about the changing dynamic in the world, particularly with regards to China. I'd say, first and foremost, we need to recognize that China is a complex relationship, it's a multifaceted relationship, and it's a relationship that's changing rapidly.\n\nWe have to recognize the economic reality that we're dealing with. China is a growing economy, a rising power, and we need to welcome that, and we need to work with them economically. The fact that they are financing a large part of our trade deficit is a direct result of our engagement with them, and we need to be mindful of that. But we also need to be mindful of the implications of that relationship.\n\nRegarding their human rights record, we cannot be silent. We must be vocal in our opposition to the oppression of human rights and religious minorities. We've seen evidence of that in Tibet, and in other parts of China. We've expressed our concerns at the highest levels of government, and we'll continue to do so.\n\nNow, regarding the label you asked about \u2013 ally, rival, competitor \u2013 I'd say we need to be realistic about what our relationship with China is. We're not enemies, but we're not exactly allies either. We share certain common interests \u2013 in nuclear nonproliferation, in counter-terrorism \u2013 where we can work together. But we also have significant differences that need to be recognized.\n\nI'd say we need to think of China as a strategic competitor. A nation that's rising economically, and is making its presence known in the world. We need to be aware of the implications of that, and we need to work with our friends and allies around the world to help shape our collective response to a rising China.\n\nWe'll work with China where our interests align, and we'll work to hold them accountable where our interests diverge. And we'll do so in a peaceful and diplomatic manner, recognizing that we have a long-term interest in a stable and prosperous China."

And I'm open-minded to the idea of working with Congress to see if we can't find a way to make sure that we're giving our instruments of protection the tools they need, while at the same time, protecting the rights of our citizens.\n\nNow, I do want to emphasize that the existing program, the terrorist surveillance program, is a vital tool, and it's a necessary tool.

We've been able to gather intelligence that has helped us prevent attacks.\n\nBut I'm also mindful of the concerns that people are expressing, both about the oversight and the balance between national security and civil liberties.

We're working closely with our partners in the region, including China, to achieve this goal.\n\nRegarding the six-party talks, I believe that the format has been productive in the past, and we're willing to participate in a way that's constructive and helps to move the process forward. However, I also want to make it clear that we won't engage in talks just for the sake of talking. We need to see real progress on the key issues, and that's something we'll be discussing with the Chinese and other parties in the days ahead.\n\nRegarding the issue of ballistic missiles, it's a very serious concern for the United States, and for our friends and allies in the region. We're committed to addressing this issue, and we expect North Korea to comply with its commitments under the Non-Proliferation Treaty and other international agreements.\n\nNow, on the issue of money laundering, I believe it's an important issue, but I also agree that it's not the sole focus of our policy. We need to address the broader concerns about North Korea's behavior, including its nuclear and missile programs. But we also need to take seriously the issue of counterfeiting and other forms of illicit activity, because they can have a significant impact on our financial systems and our economy.\n\nSo, we'll continue to work with the Chinese and other parties to address the full range of issues related to North Korea, and we're committed to finding a peaceful resolution to the problems on the peninsula.

First of all, I believe that Social Security is a vital program, and we must make sure that it fulfills its promise to our seniors. The system, as it stands today, is not sustainable, and we need to make some reforms to make sure that future generations have access to Social Security.\n\nAs I said in my campaign, I believe that young workers ought to have the option of setting up a personal retirement account as part of their Social Security investment. This is not a privatization of Social Security. This is not taking away from the system; it is adding an add-on. And the reason I think this is a good idea is that it gives young workers the ability to own their assets and make better gains than the current rate of return.\n\nNow, I understand that there's a disagreement on how to reform Social Security, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to work with the Democrats and Republicans to come up with a plan that will strengthen Social Security and make sure that it fulfills its promise.\n\nBut I must also say that it's essential that we address this problem now. We cannot keep kicking the can down the road and saying, \"It's okay, it'll take care of itself.\" It won't. We need to be bold and creative in thinking about how we reform Social Security.\n\nI've made it clear: there are some principles that are not negotiable.

As for the recommendation on talking to our adversaries, I think we've got to be careful about who we're talking to and what we're talking to them about. I've got a problem with talking to people who are trying to harm our troops, and I've made that clear.\n\nWe've got a situation where the Syrians are housing Hamas, where the Iranians are providing arms to bomb our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. It's a complex situation. And I believe we can't just rush into negotiations without having a clear agenda and a clear set of goals.\n\nNow, I do think we need to be open-minded to talks, but it's got to be talks that are aimed at producing concrete results, not just talks for the sake of talks. I think I understand what Secretary Baker's getting at \u2013 that we need to be willing to engage. But we also need to be mindful of our national security interests and ensure that we're not engaging in a way that undermines our own security.\n\nSo it's a delicate balance.

We want to make sure that Afghanistan is a stable society, that it can provide its own security, and that its neighbors understand that a stable Afghanistan is in their interests as well.\n\nBut to answer your question specifically, it's not a hypothetical anymore, because I'm not going to reveal what we would or wouldn't do in that situation, because it's important to keep our operational capacity to ourself (sp), our friends and allies."

President Abbas and the Palestinian people deserve a chance to live in a peaceful, democratic society, and I believe that's possible.\n\nFirst, let me say that we fully support Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Authority in their efforts to establish a free and democratic society. But, it's got to be a two-way street. We need to see the Palestinians acknowledging Israel's right to exist, and we need to see them take control of their own territory. Gaza's a very tough case, because Hamas, which is a terrorist organization, is interfering with the ability of the Palestinian Authority to govern.\n\nNow, I've talked to Prime Abbas about this, and I've talked to other world leaders about this. We need to work together to figure out ways to help the Palestinian Authority get control of Gaza. And that means helping them to develop their security forces, their military, their law enforcement capabilities, so they can take on the terrorists who are trying to destabilize their own government.\n\nBut it's also crucial that we see compliance from the Palestinian side. We need to see the Palestinian leaders adhering to the principles of the Roadmap, and that means stopping the violence. It's also crucial that the international community stands strong in our support for the Palestinian people, giving them the opportunity to succeed.\n\nSo, I believe it's a very, very difficult situation, but I'm optimistic that, with the right strategies, the right approach, and the commitment to the cause of peace, we can achieve a two-state solution, and help the Palestinian people to live in peace."

Now, we've seen some turbulence in the markets, some contraction in growth, but we've also seen some strong fundamentals in place - low unemployment, low inflation, and a consumer that's still spending.\n\nNow, we're watching the data closely, and we're taking steps to address the challenges we face, particularly in the housing and financial sectors.

We'll continue to monitor the situation carefully and work with our economic advisors to take the necessary steps to keep our economy growing.\n\nOn Zimbabwe, the situation is unacceptable, and we're deeply concerned about the humanitarian crisis there. We're working closely with our international partners, including the African Union and the United Nations, to support a peaceful and democratic resolution to the situation.\n\nRegarding South Africa's role, we appreciate the efforts of the South African government to help resolve the crisis in Zimbabwe.

You've got to be able to make the tough decisions, even when they're not popular.\n\nI've also told him to surround himself with good people, people who will give him honest advice, people who will tell him what he needs to hear, not just what he wants to hear. And I've encouraged him to take care of himself, to make time for his family, to get out of the bubble every now and then. It's easy to get caught up in the bubble, but it's not good for your soul.\n\nYou know, I've also talked to President Clinton, and we've shared some of our own experiences with President Obama. We've all been in his shoes, and we've all felt the weight of the office. I think we've tried to pass on some of the lessons we've learned, some of the things we wish we'd known when we were in his shoes.\n\nBut at the end of the day, it's his presidency, and he's going to have to find his own way.

We will continue to work with the international community to keep pressure on Saddam Hussein to ensure that his government takes concrete actions to disarm.\n\nI must say, I'm not surprised that Saddam is making these overtures, given the increasing pressure he's facing. This is a clear sign that our efforts are having an effect. But the world won't be fooled. We'll keep the pressure on, holding Iraq to account and pursuing our diplomatic efforts to secure a peaceful resolution that will bring disarmament to the world. Thank you."

I'm joined here today with Prime Minister Blair, and I'll let him have a chance to respond as well.\n\nFirst of all, I do view the attacks today as a direct attack on our efforts to bring stability and democracy to Iraq. The enemy we're facing is a terrorist enemy that will stop at nothing to achieve their goals. And their goal is to undermine the efforts of the Iraqi people to become a free and democratic society.\n\nAs for the question of sovereignty, I'm as committed as ever to transferring sovereignty to the Iraqi people. We're working hard, along with the Iraqi Governing Council, to ensure that we have a legitimate, representative government in place by June 30th. The transfer of sovereignty will be a significant milestone in our efforts to bring stability and democracy to Iraq.\n\nNow, the attacks are certainly a challenge, and we're doing everything we can to confront the enemy and to protect our troops and the Iraqi people. But I'm confident that we'll be able to meet our goal of transferring sovereignty by June 30th.\n\nTony, would you like to add anything to that?"

    "gen_response": "Thank you for that question. I'm happy to be here with President Fox, and we've had some very productive discussions about trade and other issues.\n\nFirst of all, let me say that the United States is committed to free trade. We believe that trade is a powerful tool for economic growth, for creating jobs, and for improving the standard of living for people around the world. And we're committed to moving forward with free trade agreements in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nRegarding a free trade agreement for North America, President Fox and I have discussed this issue, and we agree that it's a goal worth pursuing. However, we also recognize that there are some complex issues that need to be worked through, such as transportation and agricultural trade. But I'm confident that with hard work and a willingness to compromise, we can make significant progress on these issues.\n\nNow, regarding a free trade agreement for the Americas, it's a more ambitious goal, but one that I think is worth striving for. We've already made significant progress through the Free Trade Area of the Americas initiative, and we're committed to continuing to work with our partners in the region to move this process forward.\n\nNow, I know that there are some countries that have expressed opposition to a free trade agreement, and that's not unexpected. But I'm confident that we can work through those concerns and find common ground. And I'm willing to work with the leaders of those countries to address their concerns and find a way forward.\n\nI think it's worth noting that a free trade agreement for the Americas could bring significant benefits to the people of this hemisphere. It could create jobs, increase economic growth, and improve the standard of living for people across the region. And so, while there are certainly challenges to be overcome, I believe that the potential benefits make it worth pursuing.\n\nThank you for that question."

But I'm confident that our allies and friends around the world will begin to step up and provide the assistance that's needed.\n\nWe've got some countries that have already committed to helping, like the South Koreans and the Poles, who have sent troops. We've got Japan and Italy who are committed to sending troops. And we've got other countries who are interested in participating as well.\n\nIn terms of debt relief, that's an important part of helping Iraq get back on its feet. The Paris Club, as you know, has worked out a deal to forgive a significant portion of Iraq's debt. And we're working with other countries to try to get more debt forgiveness.\n\nNow, I know it's a slow process, but it's a process that's underway. And I'm confident that, over time, our friends and allies will step up and help us with the security effort.\n\nBut make no mistake about it, we will do what it takes to succeed in Iraq. We're committed to the success of the Iraqi people, and we're committed to making sure that the mission is accomplished.\n\nIt's tough work, but we're making progress, and I'm confident that in time, the world will see the progress we're making."

You know, I believe that Social Security is a vital part of our safety net, and we need to make sure that it's solvent and sustainable for future generations. And that's why I'm proposing personal accounts as a part of a comprehensive reform package.\n\nNow, I understand that there are concerns among some of the Democrats, and I respect that. But I believe that personal accounts offer a way to give younger workers, in particular, a chance to build a nest egg of their own, to have a stake in the system, and to know that they're going to have a more secure retirement.\n\nNow, I know some of the Democrats are saying that this would undermine the Social Security system. But I think they're misunderstanding how personal accounts would work. Personal accounts would allow workers to take a portion of their payroll taxes and invest them in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. This would give them a chance to earn a higher rate of return than what they're currently getting from the Social Security trust fund.\n\nAnd here's the key point: the accounts would be voluntary. Nobody would be forced to participate if they don't want to. And those who choose not to participate would stay in the traditional Social Security system, just as it exists today.\n\nNow, I believe that this would help to build a more sustainable Social Security system for the future. By giving younger workers a chance to build their own wealth, we would reduce the burden on the system over time. And by allowing workers to invest a portion of their payroll taxes, we would create a more efficient and effective way to manage our retirement system.\n\nSo, I think personal accounts offer a way to strengthen and modernize Social Security, to make it more secure for future generations. And I'm willing to work with Democrats and Republicans to make sure that we get this done.\n\nAnd let me just say one more thing. This is not just about politics; this is about making sure that our Social Security system is secure for the people who depend on it. And I'm committed to working in a bipartisan way to make sure that we get this done. Thank you."

What's most important is that the Belarussian people have the right to choose their own leaders and determine their own future.\n\nAs for Russia's influence in the region, we've been clear that we're concerned about the erosion of sovereignty and the bullying of neighboring countries. We've made it clear that we stand with our friends and allies in the region who are committed to democracy and freedom.\n\nBut let me also say this: I do believe that the United States and Russia have common interests on a range of issues, including counter-terrorism, non-proliferation, and energy security. And we're going to continue to pursue those interests in a way that's consistent with our values and our principles.\n\nSo, I wouldn't say that we're prepared to \"go all the way\" in the sense of trying to impose our will on the situation, but we are going to continue to advocate for democracy, freedom, and the rule of law, and we're going to work with our partners and allies to achieve those goals.

I think it's a great opportunity to discuss this important power granted to the President.\n\nFirst of all, I believe that the power to grant pardons is a solemn responsibility, and it's not something that should be taken lightly. I've always approached this issue with a great deal of care and thoughtfulness.\n\nMy philosophy on granting pardons is that they should be awarded in cases where there's clear evidence of an individual's rehabilitation, or where the circumstances of the pardon would serve the interests of justice. I've been guided by a commitment to fairness, compassion, and the rule of law.\n\nI'm not concerned about comparisons to my predecessors. I'm concerned about doing what's right and just in each individual case. I believe that the pardon power should be used judiciously and with restraint, rather than as a way to curry favor or reward supporters.\n\nI think that my record on pardons reflects my commitment to these principles. I've taken a careful and deliberate approach, reviewing each case on its merits and consulting with my advisors to ensure that we're making the right decision.\n\nSo, I don't view myself as being stingy when it comes to pardons. I view myself as being a careful and thoughtful steward of this great power that's been entrusted to me as President."

It's tough, there's no question about that. The enemy is determined to undermine our efforts, but I believe we've got a good strategy in place.\n\nThe joint operations with the Iraqi forces, the surge that we implemented earlier this year, I believe has been effective in addressing the security concerns in Baghdad and in Anbar Province. There's still a lot of work to be done, don't get me wrong, but I believe we're making progress.\n\nNow, regarding the missing soldiers, we're doing everything we can to locate them. Our military's working hard to find those missing soldiers, and we will do everything in our power to bring them home. I'm confident that the brave men and women of our military will do everything they can to locate and rescue our missing soldiers.\n\nAs to sustaining our policy, I believe that we must stay the course. The stakes are high in Iraq, and we cannot let the terrorists and the insurgents win. If we were to leave now, I fear that the consequences would be catastrophic \u2013 for us, for our allies, and for the Iraqi people.\n\nI know that there are those who disagree with our policy, and I respect that.

You know, I've always believed that our country needs a comprehensive energy strategy, one that promotes energy security and reduces our dependence on foreign oil. Now, I know some folks might say, \"Hey, with oil prices high, we don't need those tax breaks.\" But the truth is, we need to create a stable environment for our energy producers, so they can make the investments necessary to increase supply and reduce our reliance on foreign oil.\n\nNow, I understand that some of my critics might say we're being inconsistent, but I'd argue that we're not. We're simply acknowledging that the world has changed since we first started talking about this issue, and we need to adapt to those changes. But the underlying principle remains the same: we need to promote energy production, energy conservation, and energy efficiency.\n\nThat being said, I'm open to having a constructive conversation about our energy policy, and that includes looking at tax breaks and incentives. But we need to be careful not to send the wrong signal to our energy producers. We need to make sure that we're giving them the confidence to move forward with their investments.\n\nAnd let's not forget, we've made some significant strides in this area, like the Energy Policy Act of 2005. It's a commonsense approach that promotes conservation, increases energy efficiency, and encourages the development of new technologies. So, I'm open to working with Congress to make sure we're getting our energy policy right, but I'm also committed to making sure that we're promoting energy security and reducing our dependence on foreign oil."

The Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, did express concerns about the impact of biofuels on global food prices, and I share those concerns.\n\nNow, while the development and use of biofuels have been important goals of my administration, particularly with regards to our commitment to reducing our nation's dependence on foreign oil, we also understand the unintended consequences, especially when it comes to food prices.\n\nAs for what the United States can do, I'd like to highlight a few areas of action. First, we've made significant contributions to international food relief efforts. We've committed over $2 billion to food aid programs around the world. I also announced a request for an additional $1 billion in the '09 budget to support food aid and agricultural development programs.\n\nSecond, we're also working to improve the global agricultural productivity. We've committed to support research and development initiatives, including drought-tolerant crops and other new technologies to help increase yields and reduce the pressure on global food supplies.\n\nThird, we recognize the need for market-based solutions. We'll continue to push for more open trade and market liberalization in international agricultural markets, as well as continue our efforts to address the distortions caused by subsidies and other trade barriers that artificially raise food prices.\n\nLastly, we must look at the role of biofuels more closely. I instructed the EPA Administrator, Stephen Johnson, to review the impact of our biofuels policy on global food prices. We're also engaged in talks with U.S. farmers, automakers, and other key stakeholders to make sure we're on the right path.\n\nNow, this crisis requires a coordinated global response, and I'm committed to working with international partners, including the G8, to ensure that we're doing everything possible to support global food security and alleviate the suffering of those who are most vulnerable."

Both countries present unique challenges that require our attention and action. In Afghanistan, we're making progress. The Taliban are on the ropes, and the Afghan people are increasingly turning against them.\n\nHowever, we do face a challenge in the form of increased attacks, particularly in the east and the south.

We have made progress, despite the challenges and setbacks. The insurgency is a real challenge, but we are adapting our tactics, and we will prevail.\n\nI understand that there are doubts and concerns among the American people, and I respect that.

And I've made my fair share of them. But, if I had to look back, I'd say one of the biggest mistakes I made after 9/11 was the handling of the intelligence on Iraq, specifically WMD.\n\nYou see, we were given intelligence that suggested Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, and I relied on that intelligence to make my decision to go to war in Iraq. Now, in hindsight, it's clear that the intelligence was flawed, and we didn't find those WMDs. That was a difficult lesson to learn, and it had significant consequences.\n\nOne of the lessons I learned from this experience is the importance of critically evaluating intelligence, questioning assumptions, and being more careful in articulating the justifications for going to war. I also realized that, as President, you've got to be willing to challenge your own assumptions, to question the advice you're getting from your team, and to seek diverse perspectives.\n\nAnd I'd like to think that, as a result of this experience, I became a more thoughtful and cautious leader, particularly when it comes to matters of war and peace. But, you know, as President, you've got to be willing to learn from your mistakes and move forward, and that's exactly what I've tried to do.\n\n(pauses)\n\nAnd one other thing: I've also learned that, in the aftermath of 9/11, we were all feeling the heat of the moment, and it's easy to get caught up in the immediacy of a crisis. But, as President, you've got to take a deep breath, reflect on the situation, and think carefully about the long-term consequences of your actions.\n\n(lowering his voice)\n\nThese are hard lessons to learn, but I believe they've made me a better leader, and I hope they'll serve as a reminder to future Presidents to always approach these kinds of decisions with caution and humility."

But I will tell you that the situation in Iraq is complex, and it's tough. There's no question about it. There's sectarian violence, there's ethnic violence, and there's terrorists who are trying to stop the advance of a young, fledgling democracy.\n\nNow, I've always said that Iraq is a central front in the war on terror, and I believe that's true. I believe that if we were to leave before the job is done, it would embolden the enemy, and they would be more likely to come to our shores. I mean, these people have made it clear what their intentions are. They want to harm Americans, they want to harm our allies, and they want to disrupt the economy.\n\nNow, regarding the notion of an open-ended commitment, I would say that, first of all, we're working on a specific task, and that's to help the Iraqis get to the point where they can take care of themselves. And that's a clear goal. It's a noble goal. And I believe we're making progress towards that goal.\n\nIt's also important for Americans to remember that we've had troops stationed in Japan since 1950, in South Korea since 1953. We don't consider those open-ended commitments. What we consider them is the United States being a reliable partner and helping our friends and allies to achieve their objectives. And that's exactly what were doing in Iraq.\n\nAnd as for the issue of victory, I believe that victory is important, because I believe that it's in our interest to help the Iraqis succeed, and I believe we can succeed. We've got a plan in place. It's a good plan. It's the Baghdad Security Plan, and it's making progress.\n\nAnd I understand that it's tough, but I also understand that, you know, resolve is needed in order to achieve a difficult objective. And I'm committed to seeing this through to the end."

We're working together to address this threat. And I'm optimistic that we can get a consensus on a approach that will allow us to move forward.\n\nNow, I'm not going to prejudge what we'll do if we don't get a consensus.

And if that means that we have to move forward without approval from some of our allies, I'm prepared to do so.\n\nBut I want to stress that we're not there yet. We're still in the process of consulting and working with our allies, and I'm optimistic that we can get a positive outcome. And I think, by the way, that our allies are beginning to understand the threat that we face, and I think they're beginning to understand the logic of a missile defense system.\n\nAnd I'd like to hear from the Prime Minister on his views on this.

We're committed to finding common ground, but we've got to be realistic about the impact it would have on the American economy. I believe our proposal for a flexible, market-based approach to reducing emissions is the right one. We'll continue to work with our allies to find a solution that works for everybody.\n\nRegarding North Korea, we're committed to a peaceful resolution to the situation, but we're also clear-eyed about the challenges we're facing. We're working closely with our allies, particularly South Korea, Japan, and China, to find a way forward.\n\nNow, I know the international press may be critical at times, but I'm focused on doing what's right for the United States. We'll keep working with our allies, we'll keep talking, and we'll find a way to resolve these differences.\n\nI remember during the campaign, I talked about a new era of U.S. diplomacy, and that's exactly what we're trying to achieve. We're not going to just accept the status quo; we're going to challenge our friends and our foes alike to join us in finding new solutions to the world's problems.\n\nSo, I assure our allies that we value our relationships, we're committed to working with them, and we'll continue to do what's right for the United States and for the world.

It's crucial that we allow them the time to do so.\n\nNow, on the issue of energy policy, I've made it clear that we need to address our nation's energy needs in a comprehensive manner. We cannot afford to be held hostage by fluctuations in global energy markets. I support a broad approach that includes increased exploration, research into alternative fuels, and conservation.\n\nRegarding the Republican bill in the House, I'm willing to consider measures that could help ease the burden on our energy consumers, including those in California. However, we must also ensure that any steps we take are environmentally responsible and consider the long-term implications.\n\nI understand that there are concerns about my background, and I want to assure the American people that my policies are driven solely by what's in the best interest of this great nation. As a nation, we need to come together to find solutions to our energy challenges, rather than resorting to partisan blame. We must take a comprehensive approach that balances the needs of our economy, our environment, and our energy security.\n\nAnd let me be clear: we will do what's right for America, not just what's convenient for the oil industry. We'll make decisions based on the facts, not on speculation or special interests."

And I'm committed to working with Congress to get the resources necessary to do that.\n\nWe're going to have to do some cost estimates, but I'm not going to estimate the cost of a battle, and that's what this is \u2013 a battle to protect America against terrorism. One of the things we're going to have to do is to find new technologies, to find new ways to do our business, and to make sure that we allocate our resources wisely.\n\nI think it's going to take a sustained effort, and I think it's going to take a commitment from all levels of government. Now, I know the federal government's going to have to take a lead role, but I also expect the state and local governments to step up and to be creative in the way they work, just like the federal government will be creative in the way we work.\n\nAnd the private sector, of course, is going to play a significant role, too. I mean, one of the things that we're going to have to do is to work with our INS to make sure that we can create a system that helps us track in and out, and the private sector's going to be involved with that.\n\nNow, I know we've got to be careful. We can't break the bank, but on the other hand, we can't just shortchange at a time of war. And I'm going to work with our budget team to figure out the best way to allocate these resources. I'm not going to give you a specific dollar estimate, but I can tell you that we'll continue to work to make sure we get it right."

It was a fantastic election, and I think our message resonated with the American people.\n\nNow, regarding my own election, I think it's clear that the outcome was confirmed by the Supreme Court, and I accepted that decision. I think the American people, when given a choice, can make good decisions. And I think they made a decision to give me a second chance to serve, and I'm grateful for that.\n\nAs for whether this election validates my presidency, I think what validates my presidency is the hard work that we've done over the past four years to make America safer, more prosperous, and more compassionate. I mean, we've worked tirelessly to defend our country against terrorism and responded to natural disasters like Katrina. We've also pursued a foreign policy that's based on American values, such as freedom and human rights. So, the validation comes from the work that we've done, not just one election or another.\n\nBut, I must say, the midterm elections were a powerful reminder that the American people are responding to our message. They believe that we're on the right path, and I'm proud of the results."

We'll take our time, make sure we get the right person, 'cause this is a critical position. It's a big job, and we want to make sure we get it right.\n\nNow, regarding the question of should the new Chairman get a chance to pick their own person, I think that's a mighty fine idea. When I named Alan Greenspan to the Fed, he had his own team, and that was important to him. And I think that's important to the new Chairman. They've got to have their own folks in place, people they trust, people they believe in, in order to make informed decisions.\n\nSo, the answer is, I'll certainly take that into consideration, but ultimately, the decision is gonna be based on who's the best person to fill that job.

But I must remind you that this is a ongoing investigation, and I'm not going to jeopardize the opportunity for the Justice Department to pursue this investigation.\n\nNow, I think it's a little premature for me to step in and ask for affidavits. We've just begun this process, and I don't want to interfere with the Department of Justice's ability to conduct this investigation. The attorney general, John Ashcroft, is a highly capable man, and I have every confidence in his ability to conduct a thorough and fair investigation.\n\nWe're going to let the Justice Department do its job, and if they determine that there's a need to take further action, we'll take that action.

And I appreciate Senator Harkin's comments, but I make the decisions.\n\nRegarding the Abu Ghraib prison situation, I can tell you that it's unacceptable, it's shocking, and it's disturbing. It's a sad day for our country and for the military, because the actions of a few have tarnished the good name of the United States and the fine men and women who serve in our military.\n\nAs for the images, I think it's safe to say that they've caused significant damage, not just in our country, but around the world. The images of abuse and mistreatment are terrible, and they do not reflect the values of the United States of America or the values of the men and women who serve in our military. We value human rights, we value human dignity, and we will get to the bottom of this, I promise you that.\n\nBut I want to remind everyone that we are a nation of laws, and we will conduct a thorough investigation, and we will take the necessary action to address this situation and prevent it from happening again."

The actions we took after 9/11, in my view, were necessary to protect our national security and to spread freedom and democracy in a part of the world that had been plagued by tyranny and terrorism.\n\nNow, I understand that those actions may have created tensions and concerns among some people, particularly in the Muslim world. And I want to assure you that we're actively working to address those concerns and to build stronger relations with our allies and friends.\n\nFirst, we're working to promote a positive vision of America, one that emphasizes our values of freedom, tolerance, and opportunity. We're also working to engage with the Muslim world through efforts like the Middle East Partnership Initiative, which is designed to promote economic and educational opportunities, particularly for young people.\n\nWe're also working to strengthen our alliances with our traditional friends and allies, like the UK, Germany, and Japan, and to build new partnerships with countries like India and Indonesia.\n\nAnd most importantly, we're working to help create a new generation of leaders in the Muslim world who share our commitment to freedom, tolerance, and human rights. We're providing support for moderate voices within the Muslim world who are working to build a more tolerant and inclusive society.\n\nIn terms of concrete steps, we plan to increase our public diplomacy efforts, to engage in more dialogue and outreach with Muslim communities around the world. We'll also work to provide more support for programs that promote tolerance, education, and economic development.\n\nBut I also want to emphasize that America's image is not just about how we're perceived by others; it's also about who we are as a people. And so, we're also working to promote a more positive image of America by living up to our values of compassion, generosity, and hope.\n\nAnd let me just say one more thing. I'm proud of the way America has come together after 9/11 to support those in need, whether it's in Afghanistan, or in the tsunami in Asia, or in the hurricane ravaged parts of our own country. America's generosity and compassion are values that I think are worthy of our image and that will ultimately help us build stronger relationships around the world."

On the issue of combining tax reform and Social Security reform, I believe it's essential to approach these two critical matters separately and in a methodical manner.\n\nWhile I acknowledge that there are some who believe that a comprehensive overhaul of the tax code could provide alternative revenue streams for Social Security, I remain focused on addressing the pressing issue of Social Security's solvency first.\n\nMake no mistake, I'm committed to tax reform, and we're making progress in that area. However, addressing the fiscal challenges facing Social Security is a top priority for this administration. I'm concerned that combining the two efforts might divert attention and resources away from our goal of ensuring the long-term solvency of Social Security.\n\nThat being said, I am open to exploring alternative financing mechanisms for Social Security, and we're considering various options. However, any proposal must meet several key criteria, including not raising taxes, not increasing the burden on low- and moderate-income Americans, and ensuring the solvency of the Trust Fund for generations to come.\n\nSo while I appreciate the suggestions, I believe it's essential to pursue Social Security reform and tax reform in a separate, yet complementary, manner."

I believe that the Major League Baseball needs to be more proactive in ensuring the integrity of the game, and I've been encouraged by the steps they've recently taken.\n\nNow, I also understand, however, that Congress has a legitimate interest in this issue, particularly when it comes to the impact on public health. So, I wouldn't call the subpoenas an abuse of power per se, but I would caution that Congress should approach this issue with a measured hand, ensuring that their actions are well-intentioned and informed.\n\nUltimately, my goal is to see a fair and level playing field for all athletes, and to protect the integrity of the game.

We should support adoption and other alternatives that would allow them to be given a chance at life.

Well, I believe that if Republicans retain control of Congress, we'll be able to continue on the path of economic growth, job creation, and fiscal responsibility. We've made significant progress in the past few years, with tax cuts and regulatory reforms that have unleashed the energy of the American people.\n\nIf Democrats take control of Congress, I worry that they'll try to raise taxes and increase government spending, which could stifle economic growth and put a damper on job creation. We've seen this before - every time the Democrats get the keys to the car, they tend to drive it right back into the ditch. My opponent's tax plan, for example, would increase the tax burden on American families and small businesses, which would hurt our economy, not help it.\n\nNow, I know some folks might say that's just partisan talk, but the facts are clear. Our economic growth has been robust under Republican leadership, and our policies have created a climate of opportunity and entrepreneurship that has allowed Americans to thrive.\n\nI believe that by keeping taxes low, regulations reasonable, and the economy growing, we'll continue to see the best job market in a generation, with higher-paying jobs, and increased economic growth. That's the difference between our two approaches. And I firmly believe that the American people will see that, if Congress stays in Republican hands, the economy will continue to grow and prosper."

Now, hindsight is always 20/20, and I think that Secretary Gates was simply saying that, you know, we've learned a lot since the decision was made. And I think it's fair to say that, you know, we've had some successes and some setbacks in Iraq.\n\nBut I still firmly believe, based on the intelligence that was presented to me at the time, and to the American people, and to the Congress, that the decision to take out Saddam Hussein was the right decision. And I think that the world is a better place because of it.\n\nNow, I understand that there are plenty of folks who disagree with me on that, and that's okay. We're a democracy, and people are entitled to their opinions. But I think, you know, Secretary Gates was just reflecting the fact that, you know, we've learned a lot about the situation in Iraq since the decision was made, and that's just the way it is.\n\nBut I want to assure the American people, I have confidence in Secretary Gates, and I think he's doing a great job. We've talked about this issue, and I don't see any daylight between us. We're on the same page when it comes to our commitment to winning this war, and to defending this country, and I'm glad to have him as my Secretary of Defense."

We've made some progress in the past, for example, we worked with both Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill on nuclear energy.\n\nNow, that being said, today's vote on ANWR, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, was a key part of our comprehensive energy plan, and I strongly believe that it's an important part of addressing our energy needs. And I'm disappointed that it was, was rejected.\n\nBut I'm not going to give up. I understand the Congress is a co-equal branch of government and you 've got to work with the Congress to make progress on issues.\n\nNow, I can tell you this: we will continue to push forward on our energy policy, we will work with Congress to try to find areas of agreement and do what is right for this country, to try and address the energy crisis that we face. And I'm confident that we'll be able to make some progress.\n\nWe've also got to make it clear to the American people that there 's bipartisan support in Congress for the rest of our energy policy, for example, on nuclear power, on conservation, on expanding refining capacity. There's broad bipartisan support for clean technologies. There's bipartisan agreement on doubling this nation's commitment to hydrogen fuel cells and to renewable energy and wind and solar energy.\n\nWe'll continue to push forward. It's the President's job to lead, it's the President's job to push the issue, to make sure that the American people understand what's at stake here. And I'm committed to doing that."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for that question. You know, as Commander-in-Chief, it's my duty to inform the American people about the threats that we face, and I appreciate your willingness to help spread the word.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to emphasize that the vast majority of Americans are safe, and the chances of being a victim of a terrorist attack are extremely low. But, as we've seen, there are those who seek to do us harm, and it's our responsibility to be vigilant.\n\nAs for what people should be on the lookout for, I'd say the following: any suspicious activity, such as people loitering around critical infrastructure like power plants, bridges, or government buildings, should be reported immediately. If someone sees a strange vehicle or a person behaving in a suspicious manner, they should not approach them, but rather contact the authorities right away.\n\nAlso, we're asking Americans to be aware of any unusual patterns of behavior, such as people who seem to be surveilling a particular location, or who are taking pictures of sensitive areas. If someone receives a suspicious package or letter, they should not touch it, but rather contact the authorities.\n\nNow, I want to stress that we're not asking Americans to be paranoid or to treat every stranger as a potential terrorist. But rather, we're asking for their help in being vigilant and reporting anything that seems out of the ordinary.\n\nThe FBI and local law enforcement are working tirelessly to investigate any leads and to disrupt potential terrorist plots. And I'm proud to say that, thanks to the hard work of our intelligence agencies and law enforcement, we've been able to prevent numerous attacks and bring many terrorists to justice.\n\nSo, I urge all Americans to remain vigilant, but not to let fear dictate their lives. We will not let the terrorists win. We will continue to work tirelessly to protect our great nation, and we'll do so with the help of the American people.\n\nAnd, as I always say, \"If you see something, say something.\""

I will say that we do have a strong relationship with Pakistan, and we're working closely with President Musharraf on a range of issues.\n\nNow, regarding the idea of granting legal status to a small number of illegal Pakistanis, I want to emphasize that we need to have a comprehensive approach to immigration reform. We need to make sure our borders are secure, and that we've got a system that's fair and humane for those who are trying to enter our country.\n\nThat being said, I'm open to exploring options for those who are here, who are law-abiding, who are paying taxes, and who are contributing to our economy.

First of all, I think it's ambitious to think that we can get an agreement by May, but it's worth striving for. I believe that the relationship between the United States and Russia is a very important one, and we're committed to working hard to make sure that we can reduce the nuclear arsenal.\n\nAs for the second part of your question, I believe that we're making progress on the issue of treating this as a treaty. I think it's essential that we make it clear that we're committed to reducing our nuclear arsenals, and we want to do it in a way that is verifiable and reliable.\n\nAnd on the third part of your question, I think we're making good progress on the issue of destruction versus storage. I have made it clear to the Russians that I want to see a commitment to irreversibly dismantling these nuclear warheads, and not just storing them. I think that's essential.\n\nNow, I know that there's a lot of technical work to be done, and there's a lot of negotiating to be done, but I'm optimistic that we can get something done. I've had some good conversations with President Putin about this issue, and I think we're on the right track.\n\nBut let me make one thing clear: my commitment to reducing nuclear arsenals is not just about the size of the arsenals; it's about making sure that we're not creating a situation where these nuclear arms start to proliferate to other countries. That's a great concern of mine, and I think it's a concern of the Russian government as well.\n\nSo, we'll keep working hard, and we'll see what we can accomplish. But I think it's too early to say for sure whether we'll have an agreement by May or not. We'll just have to keep working at it."

The situation with Iran is different than it was with Iraq, and we're approaching it in a different way.\n\nWe're working with the international community, through the United Nations, to put pressure on Iran to comply with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, and to demonstrate that their nuclear program is indeed peaceful.\n\nNow, we are prepared to deal with the Iranian regime, but we must take a firm stance. We cannot stand idly by while they continue on a path of developing nuclear technology that could threaten not only the region but also the entire world.\n\nRegarding the comparison to North Korea, it's a different situation, as you know. The six-party talks have been ongoing for some time now, and we're working to bring North Korea back to the table. But let me be clear: our goal is not to march to war with Iran. Our goal is to see that the Iranian people are able to live in peace, and that the regime in Tehran understands that they cannot pursue nuclear technology that will lead to threatening their neighbors.\n\nOur diplomatic efforts will continue in full force, but make no mistake: we're strong and resolute, and we will do what is necessary to protect our country, our interests, and the world from the threat of proliferation."

But let me be clear: our policy is not about retaliation or blackmail. It's about recognizing the immense sacrifice that our coalition partners have made alongside us in this war.\n\nThese countries have put their troops in harm's way, just like we have. They've lost brave men and women in the fight against terrorism and tyranny. And they've done it without hesitation, because they share our values and our commitment to spreading freedom and democracy.\n\nNow, when it comes to rebuilding Iraq, we believe it's only fair that our coalition partners have a role to play in the process. They've earned it. And we're not just talking about big contracts, we're talking about small and medium-sized enterprises, too. We want to create opportunities for those nations that have stood by us in this fight.\n\nAs for international support, I believe this approach will actually help generate more of it. We're not just looking for one-time contributions to the reconstruction effort; we're looking for long-term commitments from our partners. And by involving them in the contracting process, we're creating a sense of ownership and investment that will last well beyond the initial phases of reconstruction.\n\nNow, I know some folks might see this as a form of favoritism or preferential treatment. I understand that perspective, and I'm willing to have an open and honest discussion about it. But I firmly believe that our allies have earned our gratitude and our respect. And if recognizing that sacrifice through this policy helps to build stronger relationships and more cooperation in the future, then it's a small price to pay.\n\nMake no mistake, we're committed to transparency and fairness in the contracting process. We'll make sure that all bidders, whether they're from coalition nations or not, have a fair shot at securing these contracts. But we will also take into account the contributions and sacrifices of our coalition partners as we move forward. Thank you."

We'll work with our partners in the region to advance our shared interests in democracy, economic growth, and security. We're going to make sure that the United States remains a reliable and trustworthy partner for the people of Latin America.\n\nRegarding the fiscal deficit, I want to assure the American people that we're committed to restoring fiscal discipline. We've taken steps in our first term to reduce the deficit, and we're going to continue to work towards a balanced budget. We'll do it in a way that's responsible and sustainable, without raising taxes or harming the economy. We're going to make tough choices and set priorities, and we're going to work with Congress to get it done. We'll make sure that our economy remains strong and competitive, and that we're preparing for the future, not just for today.\n\nNow, I want to emphasize that addressing the deficit is a top priority for my Administration. We're going to work with Republicans and Democrats alike to get a budget that makes sense, that reduces the deficit, and that meets the needs of the American people.

The summits that we've held, including the one just last month, have shown that we can work together effectively and find common ground.\n\nNow, I know that we're not always going to agree on every issue, and we shouldn't expect to. But I do think that our shared values of democracy, freedom, and human rights create a foundation for a strong and enduring friendship.\n\nAs for the Luxembourg Presidency, I think Prime Minister Juncker and his government have done a fine job of helping to promote this partnership, and we appreciate their leadership. They've been good partners in our efforts to strengthen the transatlantic alliance, and we look forward to continuing to work with them in the months and years ahead.\n\nI think it's also worth noting that our partnership is not just about governments; it's also about the connections between our peoples. And I'm heartened to see the growing exchanges and collaborations between our universities, our businesses, and our civil societies.\n\nSo, all in all, I think the prospects for our friendship and partnership are bright, and I look forward to continuing to work with our European friends to build an even stronger relationship in the years to come.

I mean, we've made it clear that we want to see North Korea dismantle its nuclear program, and we want to see them comply with international law.\n\nNow, that being said, I'm a reasonable man, and I'm willing to listen to ideas. If our partners, including South Korea, believe that suspending or easing some of these sanctions would be a way to get them back to the table, I'm willing to consider it. But let me be clear: we're not going to unilaterally disarm, if you will, and give up our leverage without getting something in return.\n\nSo, we'll continue to work with our allies, continue to work with our partners, and see if we can find a way to get North Korea back to the table.

We've got a strong record on national security. We've been successful working with our allies to take down a brutal, terrorist regime in Afghanistan. We're working to promote democracy around the world, and we've advanced America's interests through diplomatic channels.\n\nWe've also had a positive impact on our economy, through tax cuts, as you know. We put millions of dollars back into the hands of the American people, and that helped us come out of a recession.\n\nNow, I know we're in a tough period - gas prices are high, and people are feeling the pinch, and so am I. But I've got faith in this country's resilience. Americans are strong and resolute.\n\nNow, do I worry about the elections? Yes. As the leader of the party, I want our people - our candidates - to win.  But we've just got to put it in perspective here. This is still a presidential election issue: people are looking for leadership from the person at the top.

We're working closely with our partners in the region, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan, to help find a solution to this conflict.\n\nAs for Secretary Rice's mission, she will continue to engage with the parties involved to encourage a cease-fire and a return to diplomacy. Her instructions will be to speak with anyone who can help us achieve that goal, and that includes the Lebanese government, of course. As for meeting with the Syrians, we've made it clear that Syria can play a constructive role in this conflict by exerting its influence over Hizballah and encouraging them to halt their aggression.\n\nBut let me be clear: we will not engage with Syria until they meet certain conditions, including the release of the Israeli soldiers who were kidnapped, and a demonstration that they're serious about moving forward on a peaceful resolution to this conflict.\n\nWe're committed to finding a lasting solution to this conflict, one that protects Israel's security, and respects Lebanon's sovereignty, and helps the people of Lebanon rebuild their lives.\n\nWe believe that a United Nations resolution that includes a robust international force is the key to a sustainable solution.

Of course, knowing how to enrich uranium is one thing, but actually having a program to enrich uranium is another. And the reason I'm concerned about Iran is because I believe they're hiding a nuclear program. They've been murky about their intentions, and I believe they've got a nuclear weapons program hidden from the international community.\n\nNow, when it comes to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, it's true that countries that sign onto that treaty are allowed to have peaceful nuclear programs, and we support that. But I think the international community has got to be careful not to be naive about countries that are developing nuclear capabilities that could be used in a way that's not consistent with the principles of the treaty.\n\nSo, what I'm trying to do is to work with the international community to say, \"Look, we've got to draw a line here. We've got to make sure that countries that sign onto this treaty are indeed being transparent and indeed have pure intentions.\" And I believe that's a standard that the international community should be able to agree on.\n\nIn terms of pressure at the United Nations, I believe the Security Council has an important role to play here. We've been working with our allies to bring pressure to bear on Iran to be more transparent, to stop the nuclear program, and we're hopeful that that pressure can be effective.\n\nBut let me make one thing clear: we will not accept a nuclear-armed Iran.

That's why this work with the Security Council needs to represent all nations which interact with the region and have a stake in building as much peace stability and global resilience to that numerous terror threats."

I know that he, like me, wants to make sure that we approach this issue of Social Security reform in a responsible and thoughtful way.\n\nRegarding the issue of transition costs, I understand that this is a legitimate concern. However, I do not believe that it is an insurmountable one. We have been working on this issue for some time now, and we believe that there are ways to phase in private accounts over time that would help to mitigate the financial costs of implementing this plan.\n\nIt's also important to remember that the transition costs, while significant, are a one-time expense. Once we make this transition, we will not only be adding a new layer of security for our citizens but also addressing the long term fiscal problems that threaten the very solvency of our Social Security system.\n\nRegarding the issue of rushing into print, I can assure Chairman Greenspan that we are moving forward on this issue in a careful and deliberate manner. We are taking the time to listen to all perspectives on this issue, to work with the Congress to build support and to make sure that we are getting this right. I believe that we will have time to have a thorough and thoughtful debate on this issue and we will timing it with a deliberation that is proper.\n\nAnd let me just add, that the status quo on Social Security is not acceptable, we have a problem that's been kicked down the road for decades and I'm committed to solving the problem. I agree with Chairman Greenspan that we should take our time to get it right, but I don't believe we should delay."

The United States is committed to supporting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia, and we strongly believe that the conflict in the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia must be resolved peacefully.\n\nIn terms of the kind of help we can offer, we are working closely with the Georgian Government to support their efforts to resolve this conflict through diplomatic means. We are providing economic assistance and humanitarian aid to help those affected by the conflict.\n\nBut I want to emphasize that our involvement is not just about providing aid, it's also about using our diplomatic influence to encourage all parties to come together and find a peaceful solution. We are working with the United Nations, the European Union, and other international organizations to support this process.\n\nRegarding the position of the Georgian Government, I think it's commendable that they are committed to a peaceful resolution of this conflict. And I agree with them that the main problem is indeed the presence of outside forces - or third forces, if you will - that are interfering in this conflict.\n\nIt's clear that the conflict in Georgia is being fueled by external factors, and it's our assessment that Russia's support for separatist groups is a contributing factor to this conflict. We urge all parties to exercise restraint and to work towards a peaceful solution.\n\nThe United States is committed to supporting the people of Georgia in their efforts to build a stable, democratic, and prosperous future, and we will continue to work with them to find a peaceful resolution to this conflict.

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question. I understand the concerns that many Americans have about the situation in Iraq, and I share those concerns. But I must respectfully disagree with the notion that our actions in Iraq have enhanced Al Qaeda.\n\nFirst of all, our actions in Iraq were not just about Iraq. We were part of a broader global strategy to prevent terrorists from finding safe havens and sponsoring states. Saddam Hussein's regime, with its proven track record of aggression and animosity towards the United States and its neighbors, posed a real threat to regional stability and to our national security.\n\nNow, I will acknowledge that Al Qaeda has indeed taken advantage of the situation in Iraq to try to foment violence and to try to, as you said, use it as a recruiting tool. But the key is that now, they're public enemy number one in Iraq. We've got a new government in Iraq that is committed to the advance of democracy and the rule of law, and we're working with them to defeat these killers.\n\nWe must remember, the terrorists were in a position to attack us before we went into Iraq. They were a threat before we began this war on terror, and they will remain a threat unless we continue to take decisive action to stay ahead of them.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that our work in Iraq has been easy or that we haven't encountered challenges along the way. We have, and it's tough. But I will say this: we're making progress in Iraq, we're making progress against Al Qaeda, and we will not allow the terrorists to dictate the course of history.\n\nWe will not retreat. We will not surrender. We will not be intimidated by the tactics of these cold-blooded killers, and we will continue to take the fight to them, wherever they try to hide and wherever they try to operate.\n\nMake no mistake, we are determined to win the war on terror, and we will succeed in our mission to make America safer and the world a more secure and a more peaceful place."

That means we've got to set priorities and make some tough decisions. But I'm confident that we can do that without resorting to raising taxes.\n\nLet's be clear: raising taxes would be a bad idea, especially during a time when our economy is still growing. We need to keep our tax relief in place to continue to stimulate economic growth.\n\nNow, with regard to Iraq, we're committed to supporting our troops and the mission to bring stability and security to the Iraqi people. We're working closely with the Iraqi government to help them build their own security forces, and we're making progress.\n\nIn terms of the overall budget, we'll continue to work with Congress to find ways to cut unnecessary spending, streamline government, and eliminate waste and abuse. That's the way we'll be able to meet our priorities, including supporting our troops and investing in our nation's infrastructure.\n\nBut let me be clear: we will not raise taxes.

Now, in hindsight, of course, we know there were no WMDs found in Iraq, but at the time, I, along with my national security team, felt it was essential to protect the American people from the threat that we believed was real.\n\nRegarding the rhetoric, yes, I do recall that there were increased tensions and strong language being used, particularly with the phrase 'world war III'. However, I think it's essential to remember the broader context: this was in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, and we were taking a hard stance against terrorism and proliferation of WMDs. While perhaps it could be seen as intense, I believe the seriousness of the situation warranted decisive language and decisive action."

I believe that there are areas where we can cooperate, such as counter-terrorism and non-proliferation.\n\nHowever, I also want to be clear that we'll be discussing our differences in a straightforward and candid manner. We cannot compromise on issues that involve the security of our allies, and we cannot ignore Russia's actions in certain regions, including their involvement in Georgia. We will work towards finding a diplomatic solution, but we'll also be firm on our principles.\n\nSo, to answer your question, we're working diligently to avoid a diplomatic train wreck, but we won't shy away from tough conversations.

Our goal is to emerge with a more constructive and positive relationship with Russia, one that benefits both our nations and the international community."

I asked him why he did it and he said he was just telling the truth, and I said, well, it would have been a whole lot easier for me to have heard it face-to-face. But, you know, Scott was a good man, a good public servant. And you know, I've made my peace with it.\n\nNow, on Senator Obama's trip to Iraq, I hope he'll give the surge the time it needs to succeed. I think it's very important for him, if he wants to have a better understanding of the situation on the ground, that he meet with General Petraeus, who's doing a fantastic job, and more importantly, talk to the troops. I would tell him to go out there, in harm's way, and see what's going on. See the rebuilding going on, see the governance going on. I'm confident if Senator Obama does that, he'll come away with a much more positive view of the situation on the ground in Iraq.\n\nAnd also, I'd advise him to remember what the consequences of defeat would be. I think it's very important to remember the history of the region. The terrorists will become more emboldened, the violence will spread, there will be more instability in the region. And I believe that's not in the interest of the American people.\n\nBut I think it's great that Senator Obama is going. It's good to go and see for yourself what's going on in the region, it's good to get out and talk to people.

Personal relationships and direct communication can go a long way in building support.\n\nFurthermore, we need to work together to address the concerns of those who may be skeptical of trade agreements. We need to make the case that trade can benefit workers, farmers, and small businesses in our countries, and that the benefits of trade are not just limited to large corporations.\n\nI'm optimistic that with the help of our Latin American friends, we can overcome the obstacles and achieve our goal of a Free Trade Area of the Americas.

I'm concerned about the future, and the threat from rogue nations.\n\nNow, in terms of incentives, I think what we're going to be doing is looking at ways in which we can work together to address the concerns that Russia has \u2014 for example, on the NATO-Russia Council, where we're going to be sitting down and talking about ways in which we can share information and coordinate our activities.\n\nNow, I don't get ahead of the discussions that need to take place. I think that we can work out a mutual agreement. But let me just say, I think it's a grand opportunity for us to work and move beyond the Cold War mentality, and to treat Russia as a friend, rather than, as you said, an adversary.\n\nAs for what I want Russia to become, I want Russia to become a trusted partner, in terms of security, and in addressing the problems that we face together. And I believe we've made some good progress in that direction. And I think that the ABM Treaty, in particular, has got to be one that is adapted to the 21st century. It's a treaty that was focused on the past, rather than the future.\n\nSo what I envision is a new responsibility between us, where we work together on global issues, like counterterrorism, and non-proliferation, and proliferation, and addressing the threats of ballistic missiles. And in that sense, I think it's a great opportunity for us to move forward."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, and thank you for having me. (pausing for a moment) Now, I'm happy to take that question and provide a little bit of clarity.\n\nFirst, let me just say that the treaty we've signed today is a historic step forward in reducing the number of nuclear arsenals that we have between our two great nations. We believe it's an important step towards reducing the nuclear threat that exists around the world.\n\nNow, I'd like to answer your first question about nuclear parity. This treaty does not, in our view, skew the balance in any particular direction. It reduces the number of nuclear warheads, but it does so in a way that maintains a rough parity between the two sides. It's a balanced treaty that reflects the concerns of both countries.\n\nRegarding the second part of your question - can the treaty be terminated? - the answer is yes. Like many treaties, this one does provide for the possibility of withdrawal under certain conditions. But let me be clear: we do not anticipate that happening. We're committed to this treaty, and we believe it's in the interests of both our countries to move forward with this reduction in nuclear arsenals.\n\nNow, I'd like to address the final part of your question: is Russia still a target for nuclear forces? The answer is, we will always maintain a strategic deterrent to protect our allies and friends. However, this treaty is not just about numbers of warheads, but a profound change in the relationship between our two nations.\n\nOver the past year, we've seen a significant shift in our relationship with Russia. We've begun a new chapter in the strategic relationship between our two countries. We're cooperating on a range of issues, from counter-terrorism to non-proliferation to economic issues.\n\nAnd I'm proud to say that, because of this shift, we're now able to talk about Russia in a much more positive way. We believe that, over time, we can, indeed, envision a future in which Russia is no longer a nuclear target. But let me be clear: that future is dependent on Russia continuing to move forward on a range of non-proliferation and counter-proliferation efforts.\n\nSo, to summarize, this treaty is a major step forward in reducing nuclear arsenals, maintaining parity, and looking towards a new future in our relationship with Russia."

The Iraqis are ready to take control of their country, and they're makin' great progress in this process.

I'm in lockstep with Prime Minister Blair's sentiment on this matter. We must foster an environment conducive to peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. The stakes are high, but I remain hopeful that a two-state solution can be achieved through diplomacy and dialogue. Our administration will continue to work tirelessly with our international partners, particularly the Quartet, to revive the Road Map for peace and encourage both parties to stick to their commitments.\n\nI'd like to conclude by reiterating that these daunting challenges in the Middle East require a steadfast commitment to our shared values of freedom, democracy, and human dignity.

However, we're doing it in a way that ensures the integrity of the executive branch and protects the ability of the President to get unvarnished advice from his advisers.\n\nNow, regarding Michael Brown, I think it's best that he has the opportunity to make his own decision. As a private citizen, he can choose whether or not to testify before Congress. I'm not going to pressure him one way or the other, because that's his decision to make.\n\nI do want to say that I've got confidence in our review process. We're doing a careful and thorough investigation, and we're going to find out what went wrong and what went right. And I'm confident that in the end, we'll come up with a plan that will help us better prepare for natural disasters in the future.\n\nBut again, the issue of executive privilege is a critical one, and we're going to uphold it. It's not just about this administration; it's about all future administrations, and the ability of the President to get the kind of advice that he or she needs to make tough decisions."

One of the things we're going to do is to work with the Iraqis to establish some benchmarks, some measurements that will help us determine whether or not progress is being made. And those benchmarks will be based upon measurements such as the number of people who've got electricity, for example, or the amount of oil that's being produced.\n\nAs for a specific timeframe, I think, you know, we want to make sure that we continue to have a measured and patient approach. We're not going to put a specific timeframe on it. We want to make sure that we work with the Iraqis to establish a timeframe that is realistic, so that we can measure progress.\n\nBut I'll tell you this: I'm optimistic. I'm optimistic that we'll begin to see some real progress in the coming months. And I believe that's due in part to the Iraqi government's - new Iraqi government's determination to succeed, and the fact that we've got a new strategy on the ground."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for that question. As President, it's my responsibility to ensure that America remains competitive in the global marketplace, and that our national security interests are protected.\n\nFirst, let me say that the decision to approve or reject a merger like the one between Lucent and Alcatel is made by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, which is an interagency committee that reviews these kinds of transactions for national security implications.\n\nIn general, I believe that foreign investment in the United States is a positive force. It brings in new capital, new technology, and new ideas that can help our economy grow and create jobs. However, I also believe that we have to be mindful of our national security interests and make sure that any foreign acquisition or investment does not compromise our ability to protect our country.\n\nIn the case of Lucent and Alcatel, the CFIUS reviewed the transaction and concluded that it did not pose a national security risk. The committee considered a range of factors, including the potential impact on our military and defense industries, and determined that the merger does not compromise our national security.\n\nNow, I know some of my fellow Americans may have concerns about foreign companies buying out U.S. firms with military contracts. I share those concerns, and I want to assure you that we will continue to carefully review any transaction that raises national security questions.\n\nBut we also have to be careful not to use national security as a pretext for protectionism. We need to be mindful of the global nature of the economy and make sure that we're not inadvertently cutting ourselves off from the rest of the world.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I'm confident that our process for reviewing foreign investments is robust and effective, and I'm committed to making sure that America remains open to foreign investment, while also protecting our national security interests. Next question, please?"

First of all, I appreciate the progress that's been made with the EU-3, and I appreciate the way that Chancellor Merkel, Prime Minister Blair, and President Chirac have worked together to try to achieve a diplomatic solution with Iran. The incentives package, as you describe it, is a generous offer to the Iranian people.\n\nNow, if, in fact, the Iranians do not respond positively, we will, of course, reassess our strategy. And I would say to you that all options are on the table. The G-8, by the way, is a very important meeting. It's a chance for the G-8 nations to get together and talk about a lot of important issues, including this one.\n\nAnd I would tell you that I would hope that the G-8 would be a unified voice in saying to the Iranians, \"It's time to make a decision.\" Now, I know that some countries may have different views about how to deal with Iran, and I respect those views. But I believe that it's essential that the G-8 be a united voice in saying, \"We need to work together to achieve a diplomatic solution.\"\n\nRegarding the U.N. Security Council, I would say that all options are on the table. We're working closely with our friends and allies to make sure that the U.N. Security Council is a relevant and effective body in dealing with the Iranian issue.\n\nAnd to the American people, I would say, first of all, that we're working hard to achieve a diplomatic solution. It's in our interest to do so. It's in the interest of peace and stability. But, secondly, I would say to you that we will not back away from our principles. We will not back away from our values. We will not back away from our commitment to defend our country and to defend our friends and allies.\n\nNow, regarding China and Russia, I appreciate the efforts of those countries to try to deal with the Iranian issue. I think it's essential that all nations work together to achieve a solution. But I would also say to you that we're not going to shy away from our principles. We're not going to shy away from our values. We're going to stand strong.\n\nAnd so, to those Americans who are frustrated, I understand that frustration. But I would say that we're making progress, and we're committed to achieving a solution that will bring peace and stability to the region. Thank you."

The revelation that North Korea has indeed developed a nuclear capability is a grave concern for the United States and for the world. When I said we would not tolerate a nuclear North Korea, I meant it. We cannot allow the proliferation of nuclear weapons, especially in the hands of a regime that has shown such disregard for international norms and human rights.\n\nIn response to these developments, we're engaging in intense diplomatic efforts. We're working closely with our friends and allies in the region, including Japan, South Korea, and China, to find a peaceful resolution to this crisis. We're also in consultations with the United Nations Security Council to ensure that the international community speaks with one voice in condemning North Korea's actions.\n\nMake no mistake, we will not take any options off the table, but our preference is for a diplomatic solution. We want to see North Korea abandon its nuclear program and return to the negotiating table. We're willing to work with the international community to provide North Korea with a better alternative, one that does not involve developing and proliferating nuclear arms.\n\nTo the American people, I want to assure them that we take this threat seriously, but we will not be intimidated. We will continue to work tirelessly to protect the United States and our interests abroad. We will not let North Korea's actions dictate our policy or undermine our resolve.\n\nAnd to the international community, I say that now is the time for collective action. We must stand together against the threat of nuclear proliferation, and we must demonstrate our resolve to uphold the non-proliferation treaty. We will not stand idly by while rogue regimes flout the rules and put the security of the world at risk.\n\nThank you, and I appreciate your question."

One thing that comes to mind is the disbanding of the Iraqi army. We made a decision to disband the army, and in retrospect, I think that was a mistake.\n\nWe had a plan to take the Baathist elements out of the army, and we should have done that, but we shouldn't have disbanded the whole army. There were many professional soldiers in that army that had a lot to offer, and by disbanding it, we created a lot of disillusioned, unemployed young men who became easy prey for the terrorists.\n\nAnother thing that I think we could have done differently is we could have brought in more troops earlier. When we hit the surge, and David Petraeus implemented the surge strategy, it worked. It worked, and it worked in a relatively short period of time.\n\nNow, that's not to say that we didn't make mistakes. We did make mistakes. We made tactical mistakes, we made strategic mistakes, but I think that we also, you know, we also had some successes. And when I look back on it, I think that the strategic decision to get rid of Saddam Hussein, the world is a better place without him, and the Iraqi people are better off without him.\n\nBut anyway, there's a lot of lessons learned, and I'm confident that as the future unfolds, people will take a harder look, a more nuanced look at what happened, and we can draw lessons from it to make sure we don't repeat some of the mistakes that were made."

We've got a lot of work to do in this country, and that includes the Department of Justice, and I think Alberto is the person to carry out that work.\n\nRegarding General Peter Pace, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, I did accept his offer to step down rather than go through a contentious reconfirmation process. Now, I understand that some folks may see a contradiction here, but I don't. General Pace served our country with great distinction, and it was his decision to step down, not mine.\n\nAnd as the Commander-in-Chief, I have a responsibility to consider the overall impact on the country. In this case, I didn't want to see General Pace go through a difficult confirmation process, and that's why I accepted his offer to step down.\n\nNow, in the case of the Attorney General, I believe Alberto Gonzales is doing a fine job, and I don't think the no-confidence vote should necessarily dictate his continuation.

However, suspending or rolling back the Federal gasoline tax might provide some short-term relief, but it's not a long-term solution to the problem.\n\nWe've proposed an energy policy that encourages more exploration and more production, including domestic production, which will help stabilize the price. And, as I mentioned in my opening statement, we're also investing in alternative technologies, such as ethanol and hydrogen.\n\nRegarding the gas prices, I understand it's a big burden for the American people. It's like a hidden tax. And, you know, I'm concerned about it. I don't have a magic wand to make the price go down, but we're working to create conditions in the energy market so that the price will stabilize.\n\nAnd I do think the oil companies, which are our -- are making profits, some of which are based upon the increased price of oil -- we need to make sure they're treating the consumers fairly and transparently, and we're going to implement the energy bill that encourages competition in the right way.\n\nNow, I will say that those companies have responsibilities as well.

You see, this treaty is not just a environmental agreement, it's also an economic one. And I think many of our European friends are finding it difficult to reconcile their environmental goals with their economic realities.\n\nNow, I'm not saying the EU nations don't care about the environment.

The National Intelligence Estimate did indeed express some concerns about the relationship between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. Now, I know there's been a lot of discussion about the strength of that intelligence, and I'll tell you that at the time, we were dealing with a threat that we considered very real.\n\nWhile it's true that the NIE expressed some doubts about the likelihood of Saddam providing WMD to al-Qaeda, it's also important to note that the report did suggest that Saddam had, in fact, had some interactions with al-Qaeda officials, and that there were some connections between Iraq and other terrorist groups.\n\n(firmly) Now, as Commander-in-Chief, I had to make a decision based on the information I had at the time. And I believed then, and I believe now, that Saddam Hussein was a threat to the United States, and to the stability of the region. The fact that he had used WMD in the past, the fact that he had the intent to develop more, and the fact that he was a supporter of terrorism, all contributed to my decision to take action.\n\n(smiling faintly) Now, I know there's been a lot of debate about this, and I respect that debate. But I think it's essential to remember that the decision to go to war was not based solely on the question of whether Saddam was working with al-Qaeda. It was based on a broader assessment of the threat that he posed, and our determination to protect the American people.\n\n(firmly) As for definitive evidence of a connection between Saddam and al-Qaeda, I think it's fair to say that we've had a lot of indications of contact and cooperation between the two. Now, I'm not going to get into all the specifics of that intelligence, but I will say that it's clear that Saddam was a supporter of terrorism, and that he had relationships with groups that shared al-Qaeda's ideology.\n\n(serious tone) Look, I understand that this is a complex and contentious issue, and I respect the views of those who disagree with me.

We're dealing with people who are trying to keep secrets, and it's a tough task.\n\nBut I do think it's essential for the American people to understand that the intelligence that was gathered, and the analysis of that intelligence, led the world to believe that Saddam Hussein was a threat.

Yes, I did refer to a \"Third Awakening\" in a conversation with some conservative journalists, and I'd be happy to explain what I meant by that.\n\nAs you may know, the first Great Awakening was a period of spiritual revival in America, led by folks like Jonathan Edwards in the 1740s. And then we had a Second Great Awakening in the mid-19th century, which was marked by a significant increase in church membership, missionary work, and social reform.\n\nNow, I believe we're seeing a Third Great Awakening in America today. I see it in the way people are looking for meaning and purpose in their lives. I see it in the way people are searching for a sense of community and belonging. And I see it in the way people are looking for answers to the big questions of life.\n\nI believe this awakening is being driven by a sense of discontent with the status quo, a sense that there's more to life than just material possessions or personal fulfillment. People are looking for something deeper, something more meaningful.\n\nNow, I know some might say that this is just a backlash against the excesses of modern society, or that it's just a fad. But I believe it's something more profound than that. I believe it's a genuine spiritual hunger, a desire to connect with something greater than ourselves.\n\nAs for contradictory evidence, well, I think we can all see signs of a culture that's still pretty divided and pretty materialistic. We still see people who are more focused on their own interests than on the common good. We still see a lot of conflict and division in our society.\n\nBut I believe that's always been the case in America, even during times of great spiritual awakening. We're a complex and imperfect people, and we always will be. But I believe that, despite our flaws, we're capable of greatness, and that this Third Awakening can be a moment of great renewal and rebirth for our country.\n\nSo, that's what I meant by the Third Awakening.

I am disappointed, but not surprised, that this memo found its way into the press. I believe it is a serious offense to leak classified information, and I take these matters very seriously.\n\nAs to the cause of the leak, I am not prepared to make any accusations at this time. However, I can tell you that we are looking into the matter, and we will take all necessary steps to protect sensitive information and to prevent leaks in the future.\n\nNow, as for the suggestion that someone is trying to undermine my Iraq policy, I would say that's speculation at this point. But I will tell you this: my team and I are united in our resolve to support the Iraqi government, to help them achieve their goals, and to bring stability and security to the people of Iraq.\n\nAnd as for my meeting with Prime Minister al-Maliki, it is business as usual. We had a productive conversation, and we are working together to address the challenges that we're facing in Iraq. So, to speculate about sabotage or undermining, I just don't think that's productive, and I don't think it's accurate.\n\nThank you. Next question."

I had a very enriching conversation with Pope Benedict, as I've had with many other world leaders, and I want to start off by saying that we share a deep commitment to the downtrodden, the poor, and those who are suffering. And we share a commitment to peace and to freedom.\n\nRegarding the conflict in Iraq, the Pope did express his concerns, as many have, and I respect those concerns. I listened carefully to what he had to say and explained our position and the reasoning behind it. I want to remind you all that our goal is to bring peace and security to the Iraqi people. And I truly believe that the actions we have taken have put Iraq on a path towards self-governance and democratic rule.\n\nWe did not have any deep disagreements on a matter such as whether the Iraq conflict was just or not. The Holy Father recognized my own good intentions. I am quite sure that he felt a personal concern for the security and well-being of Roman Catholics living in Iraq."

The United States is deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in Kosovo, and we believe that the international community must take action to resolve this crisis. As for a deadline, I think it's essential that we see some progress from the United Nations in the coming days, and I'd like to see a deadline set for the end of June.\n\nRegarding our relations with Russia, I understand that our position on Kosovo may not be in line with Russia's, but we cannot let that disagreement hold us back from taking a strong stance on an issue of such great humanitarian importance. We'll continue to engage with the Russians, and we hope that they'll ultimately see the wisdom in taking a firmer stand against the Milosevic regime.\n\nAs for the Russian missile defense proposal, I've been reviewing it carefully, and I appreciate the efforts of the Russian government to address concerns about national missile defense. However, our position remains that we need a robust defense system to protect our country from rogue states and terrorist organizations. We'll continue to work with the Russians and other nations to address these concerns, but our primary responsibility is to protect the American people."

Let me tell you, I've always said that when the facts change, you better change your assumptions, and that's exactly what happened here.\n\nIn the past, our intelligence community, in its assessment, indicated that Iran was pursuing a nuclear weapon, and I had high confidence in that assessment. However, in this latest National Intelligence Estimate, or NIE, our intelligence community has reviewed the available information, and it has made a judgment that we should change our assessment.\n\nI'm not angry about the new assessment, because I'm not an apologist. I'm a realist. And the reality is, our intelligence community has made a new assessment based on new information, and we should accept that.\n\nIn terms of the rest of the world, I'm confident that they understand that the United States is committed to keeping the world safe, and that we will continue to work with our partners and allies to address the serious challenges that we face.\n\nNow, I'll tell you this, the fact that the intelligence assessment has changed doesn't mean the threat from Iran has diminished. It's still a threat, still a challenge, and we're still committed to addressing that challenge.\n\nAnd so, we'll continue to work with our allies and friends, and we'll continue to advocate for a diplomatic solution to this problem. We'll also continue to work to make sure that our military remains strong and capable of defending our interests.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, I'm not concerned about whether or not the rest of the world will rally around us, because I'm confident in the approach that we've taken, and I'm confident that our friends and allies will continue to work with us to address the challenges that we face."

I've been very clear with the Saudi Arabians, as well as other oil-producing nations, that it's in their interest to increase production, not just in America's interest, but in their own interest. I mean, think about it: higher prices can reduce demand. And it's in their interest to make sure that there's a stable and secure supply of energy. And I've been having these conversations for a while now.\n\nNow, we've had some success in the past, where we've been able to get them to increase production temporarily, short-term. But we need to see more commitment across the board. I'm sending the Energy Secretary, Sam Bodman, to Saudi Arabia to continue these conversations. And I'm confident that we can make some progress.\n\nNow, on the economic stimulus package, I understand your concern, but I believe that the effect of the stimulus package will still be positive. I mean, think about it: people are going to have more money in their pockets, and that's going to stimulate economic activity. Now, I know that higher gasoline prices can partially offset that. But we've got a package that we believe will help small businesses, help individuals, and our economy."

I believe that this is a global problem that requires a global solution. The United States is working closely with other nations, such as members of the OPEC cartel, to increase production and stabilize the supply of oil. We are also encouraging Americans to conserve energy and reduce their reliance on fossil fuels. We support efforts to enhance energy efficiency, and our administration has proposed a number of measures to increase the supply of renewable energy.\n\nRegarding the U.S. dollar,  we believe that market forces should largely determine exchange rates. However, we will closely monitor the situation and work with our international partners to ensure that currency markets remain stable.\n\nAnd to answer your question, Prime Minister Harper may have some comments on this as well, the way I see it, we are not the ones lagging on climate change. We have created several initiatives,  and that is evident by my administration's action with the Energy Policy Act of 2005,  the policy includes such measures as improving the energy efficiency of federal buildings and increasing funding for the development of alternative fuels."

Now, I think the GSEs should continue to be regulated by the federal government, but the private nature of them allows for there not to be a subsidy from the federal government. In other words, we don't want the taxpayer to be at risk. We want there to be a private capital market, with the government in a regulatory role to make sure that the -shared-market and mortgage qintegritrage maintained, in such a way that there's confidence in the mortgage market.\n\nBut the idea of totally privatizing them, I think, doesn't make sense. What we need to do is to make sure that the regulatory framework is such that there's confidence within the market, that these companies are being run in a responsible way, and that there's a strong regulatory framework in place to ensure that. And that's what we're going to do."

The loss of innocent life is a tragedy, no matter where it occurs.\n\nRegarding the comments that President Karzai made about Pakistan's intelligence services, I must say that we're working closely with both the government of Pakistan and the government of Afghanistan to address the issue of terrorism. It's a complex issue, no question. I've spoken to President Musharraf, as you know; I've spoken to President Karzai. Both of them are deeply committed to working together to deal with the terrorist threat.\n\nNow, I think it's too early to make definitive conclusions about the participation or complicity of the Pakistani intelligence services. We're going to continue to work with both governments to get to the bottom of it.\n\nRegarding the strength of Al Qaida, I'm not going to speculate about their regenerated capabilities. What I will tell you is that we're spending a lot of time and effort to make sure that we stay on top of the intelligence. We're working closely with our allies, including Pakistan, to make sure that we share intelligence and have a comprehensive approach to dealing with the terrorist threat.\n\nAnd finally, I'm convinced that the new government in Pakistan is committed to fighting terrorism. They have, no question, taken some bold steps to deal with extremists along the border region. And I was touched by the new Prime Minister's comments the other day, where he recognized the threat that terrorism poses to his country and his people. So, we're going to continue to work together to make sure that we address this threat."

And I believe we can walk and chew gum at the same time.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that these hearings aren't important. If there's wrongdoing, there needs to be accountability. But I do think it's essential for Congress to focus on the people's business.

We'll just have to kind of work through it, and I'm confident that we can. I mean, we're a resilient country, and we've been through a lot of controversies over the course of our history. And I think we'll come out of this just fine.\n\nNow, you know, I'm not trying to be too cavalier about it. I realize this is serious business.

It's designed to provide broad-based tax relief for all Americans, particularly middle-class families, and to stimulate economic growth.\n\nNow, I understand that Congress may have some additional ideas, and I'm happy to work with them to achieve our shared goals. However, I must emphasize that we cannot and will not support tax cuts that would threaten our fiscal discipline or jeopardize our ability to meet our priorities.\n\nIf additional layers, such as corporate tax cuts or capital gains reductions, were to be added, I would need to carefully review the entire package to ensure that it remains fiscally responsible and aligned with our priorities.\n\nAs for signing a bill that reaches my desk at a higher level, I would have to evaluate it on its merits. I'm committed to working with Congress to pass a responsible and reasonable tax cut. But if the final product becomes too expensive or threatens our fiscal health, I would have to carefully consider whether it's in the best interests of the American people.\n\nLet me be clear: we're not just talking about cutting taxes for the sake of cutting taxes; we're talking about cutting taxes as part of a comprehensive plan to stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and meet our national priorities. And I'm committed to working with Congress to achieve that goal in a responsible and fiscally sound way."

We believe that a peaceful Colombia is not only in the best interests of the Colombian people, but also in the best interests of the region and the world.\n\nRegarding our level of involvement, I can tell you that we're already quite engaged in the peace process. We've been providing funding, we've been providing technical assistance, and we've been providing negotiating support to the Colombian government as they work through this difficult process.\n\nAs for whether we would be willing to take a more active role, I can tell you that we're open to exploring ways to increase our involvement, but we've got to be careful. We've got to make sure that our involvement is welcome by the Colombian government and that it's consistent with our own interests. We don't want to do anything that would be seen as heavy-handed or intrusive.\n\nI think, Andres, you've made some real progress in the peace process, and we want to support that progress.

This delegation will include representatives from various industries, including energy, technology, and manufacturing, and they'll be looking to explore new opportunities for cooperation and investment between our two countries.\n\nAs for the intergovernmental commission, I think that's a great idea. We're already discussing the possibility of establishing a joint commission that can focus on promoting economic cooperation and removing trade barriers between our two countries. This commission would bring together representatives from our respective governments, as well as the private sector, to identify areas for cooperation and to work on resolving any outstanding issues that may be hindering our economic ties.\n\nI'm optimistic that we can make significant progress on this front, and I'm committed to working closely with President Putin to make sure that we're doing everything we can to strengthen our economic partnership.

But I think we've made some real progress in changing the tone in this town.\n\nOne thing I'm committed to, and I've made it clear to the Congress, is that we're going to have a respectful dialogue, a civil dialogue, about our differences. And I think we've been able to do that for the most part.\n\nNow, I'm not naive. I know that when you're advocating for significant change, like tax relief or education reform, there's going to be some pushback. And that's okay. That's part of the process.\n\nBut I do believe that, in spite of some of the negative ads and in spite of some of the early signs of partisanship, that we're still on a trajectory towards a more civil and respectful dialogue in this town.

As President, I've made it clear that I believe in the goodness and decency of the American people, and I believe that we're engaged in a noble cause in the war on terror.\n\nNow, I know that there are differences of opinion about how to proceed, and that's healthy in a democracy. But I believe that our cause is just, and that we must stay the course. As I said before 9/11, \"faith and prayer\" can provide sustenance and comfort in times of uncertainty and crisis. And I encourage all Americans to pray for the safety and well-being of our troops, for the innocent victims of terror, and for the strength and unity of our nation.\n\nBut our response to this crisis must also be guided by a sense of resolve and determination. We cannot let the terrorists dictate our actions or undermine our will. We must stay vigilant, we must stay strong, and we must work together to protect our country and our values.\n\nI understand that there are those who may disagree with our approach, and I respect that. But I firmly believe that our actions are necessary to protect our nation and our way of life. And I would say to the American people that we must remain united and steadfast in the face of this threat. We must continue to work together to support our troops, to support the victims of terror, and to show the world that we will not be intimidated by the forces of evil.\n\nAnd so, I would say that prayer is an important part of our response, but it is not a substitute for action. We must also take concrete steps to address this threat, and that's exactly what we're doing. We're working with our allies, we're supporting our military, and we're taking steps to strengthen our homeland security. And I'm confident that, together, we will prevail."

It's not gonna be easy, but it's essential that we get this done to ensure the long-term solvency of these vital programs.\n\nNow, I know some folks might say, \"Mr. President, this is a tough political sell.\" And I agree, it won't be easy. But I truly believe that our next President has a responsibility to tackle this issue, to put the long-term needs of our nation's retirees ahead of short-term politics.\n\nIt's a tough job, but it's one that needs to be done. And I hope that our next President will have the courage and the leadership to tackle entitlement reform, and put our country on a path towards fiscal sustainability for the future. Thank you."

The United States will indeed be represented at the United Nations Conference on Racism, but at this point, we've made the decision that it will be at a low-level diplomatic representation. Our administration is deeply concerned, however, about some of the agenda items that have been proposed for discussion.\n\nWe have been very clear and consistent in stating our opposition to any attempts to brand Zionism as a form of racism or racial discrimination, because that's just not our view. Zionism is the belief in a homeland for the Jewish people, and we think it's a legitimate and worthy goal, one that's deeply rooted in history and a sense of identity.\n\nRegarding reparations for past injustices, we understand the strong emotions and sense of justice that drive this agenda item, but we also think that it's a very complex issue with many different perspectives and considerations. We don't believe that a conference like this is the right forum to resolve these extremely difficult questions, which are better left to bilateral negotiations between countries.\n\nNow, we'll continue to engage with the conference organizers and other participating nations to try to find common ground, but our core concerns regarding these agenda items remain unchanged. We hope to contribute to the fight against racism, but we will do so with our eyes wide open and our principles firmly in place."

I hope that nations will look at this moment and say, \"You know what? We can work together to effect a peaceful outcome.\" And I believe that's possible.\n\nBut I also understand that there are going to be nations that still won't agree with the actions we took. But I hope they can begin to see that the rationale for our action was to disarm a man who was a threat to the region, a threat to his own people, and, by the way, a threat to the world.\n\nAnd so, I'm hopeful that this moment can be a moment that people can get beyond our differences. But I also understand that we will continue to have our differences. That's the nature of international diplomacy.

As I have stated before, I do intend to close Guantanamo Bay. We're going to work through this, as we move forward with great care, ensuring that we don't compromise the security of the United States or our international obligations.\n\nDealing with the most dangerous detainees, as you've referenced, will be quite a challenge. We will work with Congress to ensure that our system is adequate to handle those individuals who are deemed too difficult to release, and at the same time be mindful of our constitutional standards. Some of the people being held at Guantanamo are enemy combatants. There are people, let's just say, like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, captured on the battlefield, and they are a threat to the security of the United States and the world, we will have to find a way to make sure that justice is meted out and make sure we protect the security of our country.\n\nThis will require cooperation with the Democrats in Congress as well as the international community.  It is time to close Guantanamo, as it's become a symbol of U.S. actions, that while necessary for national security grounds have, as I said, been mishandled.\n\nWe must make sure that even as we close a difficult chapter in our nation's history, we do so in a responsible way, mindful of our shared global responsibilities in the courts.

Now, I know there's been a lot of discussion about the timeline, but the fundamental goal hasn't changed.\n\nNow, I understand that General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker are working closely with the Iraqi government to assess the situation on the ground. And what's happening is, they're taking a province-by-province approach to hand over security to the Iraqis. It's a conditions-based approach, not a calendar-based approach. In other words, we're not going to hand over security to the Iraqis unless they're ready to take it.\n\nNow, I know there's been some slippage in the timeline, but I'm not deterred.

But I also want to make it clear that we're going to do this in a way that's going to make sure the Iraqis are prepared to take over.\n\nAnd let me just say, I'm heartened by the progress we're making in some of the provinces.

It's not in our nation's interest, or in the interests of our friends in the region, or for the world.\n\nIn terms of negotiations, we can assure the North Koreans, as well as other nations around the world, that we are a peaceful nation, that we seek peace in the region, that we want the North Koreans to make a choice: a choice of either continuing down the road of isolation and deprivation, or choosing a different path that will lead to a more prosperous future for their people.\n\nWith that in mind, I've made it clear that we'll work with the North Koreans, but they've got to do more than just talk the talk, they've got to walk the walk.

What I did ask President Putin, though, was to consider providing other forms of support to the efforts of the multinational force, such as training Iraqi security personnel or helping with reconstruction efforts.

As President, I have a solemn duty to protect this country and its citizens, and I will continue to take that responsibility seriously.\n\nThat being said, I do believe in the importance of being mindful of the limits of my authority as President. I'm a strong believer in the Constitution, and I've always sought to act within its boundaries. However, I also recognize that, in times of crisis and uncertainty, the President must be able to respond effectively and decisively to protect the nation.\n\nI'm always open to re-evaluating and refining my approach to ensure that I'm using my authority in a way that's consistent with the Constitution and the principles of our democracy. But I also expect my critics to recognize the gravity of the threats that we face and the need for strong leadership in times of crisis.\n\nUltimately, as President, I will continue to rely on my own judgment, guided by my conscience, my experience, and my commitment to upholding the Constitution and defending the American people."

    "gen_response": "Well, thank you for the question. I appreciate your persistence in asking about this issue. You know, I've been working closely with our allies, particularly Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac, and other world leaders, to bring an end to this conflict in Lebanon. And we have made significant progress.\n\nThe key was to address the concerns of all parties involved. The United States and France worked together to get a resolution adopted by the UN Security Council, and it's a good one. It addresses the concerns of the Lebanese government, of Israel, and of the international community.\n\nYou're right, I was initially opposed to a simple cessation of hostilities because I wanted to make sure that if we did that, it would just be a pause in the violence, and then it would start up again. I wanted to make sure that if we were going to have a ceasefire, it would be a durable one, one that would last.\n\nAnd so we worked hard to get a resolution that would address the root causes of the conflict, and I believe we succeeded in doing that. We got a resolution that calls for a cessation of hostilities, but also lays out a framework for a lasting peace in the region.\n\nNow, it's not going to be easy. There's still a lot of work to do. But I'm optimistic that we can make progress, and that's why I think it's a good resolution.\n\nAnd remember, the key is to make sure that the will of the international community is imposed on those who are trying to undermine the peace process. And that's exactly what we're doing. We're imposing our will, in a constructive way, to help bring peace to the region.\n\nSo, I think we're on the right track. And I think the question you asked is a fair one, but I hope this explanation helps clarify why we did what we did when we did it."

And that's okay. That's the way it works in a free society.

We do not condone torture. And we're abiding by the Geneva Conventions. And we're working to make sure that those values are maintained in a manner that respects the rule of law.\n\nNow, I understand that there's some controversy, and I'm not surprised by it.

The alternative of inaction is a scenario where financial markets become completely frozen, credit dries up, and the effects on the broader economy would be severe.\n\nNow, I've spoken to leaders on the Hill, and I'm pleased to report that we're making good progress on a bipartisan basis. I've worked closely with Secretary Paulson, and we're committed to keeping this legislation focused on the core issue at hand: stabilizing the financial system. I've been assured by Congressional leaders that they share our commitment to a clean bill, and I'm hopeful that we can get this done without adding unnecessary items.\n\nLet me be clear: this is a legislative bill, and it's gonna go through the normal process.

Now, I want to start by saying that the United States is committed to being a friend and partner to both India and Pakistan, and we recognize the importance of a peaceful resolution to this dispute.\n\nRegarding mediation, I want to be careful in our role. While we are prepared to help facilitate a dialogue, we believe that the key to a successful resolution lies with India and Pakistan themselves. We've encouraged both governments to engage in direct talks, and we support the Composite Dialogue process that they've established.\n\nNow, I know some have suggested that the U.N. resolution you mentioned provides a framework for a resolution. And while we recognize the relevance of that resolution, we also believe that the realities on the ground have changed significantly since 1948. We think a just and lasting settlement will require flexibility and a willingness to compromise from both sides.\n\nSo, we'll continue to encourage India and Pakistan to keep talking, to work through their differences, and to find a mutually acceptable solution. We'll offer our support and assistance as needed, but ultimately, the decision-makers are the leaders of India and Pakistan. We are urging them to take bold steps towards peace and to show a renewed commitment to this process.\n\nThis is a difficult issue, no doubt about it.

We're making progress. We're not there yet. But I'm committed to it, because I believe we can do a better job of defending our country without having a nuclear weapon, ultimately.\n\nAnd to answer your question about the ones in storage, they're being dismantled, they're being destroyed, and we are committed to reducing our stockpile, and we are doing so in a transparent way.

You can't be too careful when you're the President of the United States, traveling to a place that's still got a lot of violence.\n\nAnd so, the decision was made, and I think it was the right decision.

However, we've got to be mindful that any sanctions need to be effective and they need to have broad international support.\n\nAs for persuading the Russians and the Chinese, I've spoken to both President Putin and President Hu Jintao, and we've made it clear that we expect the international community to come together to address this threat. We're working diligently with our partners to build a consensus on how to approach this issue. The reality is that North Korea's actions are a threat not just to the region, but to global peace and stability.\n\nAs for the threat that North Korea poses, I believe it's a significant one. Their pursuit of nuclear capabilities, combined with their history of ballistic missile tests, is a grave concern. It's a concern not just for the United States, but for the entire international community. We're working closely with our allies in the region, including Japan and South Korea, to ensure that we're prepared to defend ourselves and our interests.

I believe we can.  You see, the war on terrorism is not just about one man; it's about a network, a worldwide network of terror, and it's about a ideology of hate.  We need to deal with the root causes of terrorism, the failed states, the poverty, the hopelessness that give rise to this ideology.\n\nAnd we're making progress.

We've made significant strides in developing a system that can protect the American people from a potentially catastrophic attack. If the missile had been headed towards the United States, we would have used our Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System, also known as GMD. This system, which we've deployed in Alaska and California, is designed to detect and destroy long-range ballistic missiles like the Taepodong-2.\n\nThe system works like this: once our early warning systems detect a launch, our radar and satellites track the missile. Then, if the missile is determined to be a threat to the United States, we would launch an interceptor, which would collide with the incoming missile in space and destroy it.\n\nNow, I want to emphasize that our ballistic missile defense system is not perfect, and there's still work to be done.

We've taken a tougher stance, and I believe it's yielding results.\n\nNow, I know that North Korea's nuclear test is a serious concern, and we're not taking it lightly. But let me remind you, the Clinton administration's policy of appeasement and engagement with North Korea did not prevent the development of their nuclear program. In fact, it emboldened them.\n\nOur policy, on the other hand, is one of confrontation and pressure. We've imposed tough sanctions, rallied the international community, and made it clear that North Korea's nuclear ambitions will not be tolerated. And while the nuclear test is a setback, I believe it's a cry for attention, a signal that our pressure is working.\n\nNow, as for the redline, I'm not going to sit here and specify exactly what our redline is. That's not how diplomacy works. But I will say this: any further escalation of North Korea's nuclear program, any move to proliferate or transfer nuclear materials, or any attack on our allies in the region will be met with swift and severe consequences.\n\nWe're not going to back down, and we're not going to be intimidated by North Korea's saber-rattling. We're committed to a diplomatic solution, but we're also committed to the security of our allies and the stability of the region.\n\n(pauses)\n\nAnd let me be clear: we will not negotiate with North Korea under duress. We will not be blackmailed into accepting a bad deal. We will stand firm, and we will work with our allies to address this threat.\n\n(looks around the room)\n\nThank you, next question."

    "gen_response": "Well, I appreciate the question. Let me make one thing very clear: as the Commander in Chief, I take my duties very seriously, and I will not let our nation's enemies have a say in how we deploy our troops. The idea of Congress trying to limit the Commander in Chief's ability to make decisions about the conduct of the war, I believe, would set a dangerous precedent and would potentially embolden our enemies.\n\nNow, as for the idea of a troop withdrawal deadline, I've been very clear about my opposition to that. I believe it's a recipe for disaster. Our troops are making progress, and we're beginning to see the fruits of that labor. But I will not tie the hands of our military commanders, and I will not put artificial timelines on the conduct of the war.\n\nAs to vetoing legislation that includes deadlines, I've been very clear about my position. I will veto any bill that contains a deadline for withdrawal. I think it's the wrong policy, and I think it's the wrong message to send to our troops and to our allies. We've got to be firm and resolute, and I will not compromise on that."

The United States has a deep commitment to the people of Africa, and we're proud to be working closely with President Kikwete and the African Union to address the many challenges facing the continent.\n\nFirst and foremost, let me say that the crisis in Darfur is of great concern to us. We've been working closely with the United Nations, the African Union, and other international partners to bring an end to the violence and suffering there. We've already provided significant humanitarian assistance to the people of Darfur, and we're committed to continuing to do so.\n\nIn the coming 12 months, we'll be working closely with President Kikwete and the African Union to support the peace process in Darfur. This includes supporting the African Union-led peacekeeping mission, and working with the Sudanese government to ensure that they're taking the necessary steps to bring an end to the violence and to hold perpetrators accountable.\n\nIn Somalia, we're deeply concerned about the ongoing violence and instability. We're supporting the Transitional Federal Government, and we're working with the African Union and other international partners to build a more stable and secure future for the Somali people.\n\nAnd in Kenya, we were deeply troubled by the recent violence and tribal clashes. We've been working closely with the Kenyan government to support their efforts to address the underlying issues that led to the violence, and to promote reconciliation and healing.\n\nIn all of these cases, we're committed to working closely with President Kikwete and the African Union to support African-led solutions to these challenges. We believe that the African Union has a critical role to play in promoting peace, stability, and prosperity across the continent, and we're committed to supporting their efforts in any way that we can.\n\nSo, to the people of Africa, I want to assure you that the United States is committed to standing with you as you work to address these challenges. We believe in the potential of the African continent, and we're proud to be working alongside you to build a brighter future for all Africans."

We're working closely with Prime Minister Maliki and his government to ensure that our presence in Iraq is aligned with their goals and objectives.\n\nRegarding the concerns about the U.S. presence, I understand that there are different perspectives on this issue. But I want to assure the American people and the Iraqi people that our commitment to a sovereign, united, and democratic Iraq remains unwavering. We're not going to abandon this mission.\n\nNow, that being said, we're also committed to reducing our forces as conditions on the ground permit. We've already begun the process of transitioning security responsibilities to Iraqi forces, and we're going to continue to do so in a way that's responsible and sustainable.\n\nI think it's premature to speculate about the specifics of the security agreement, but I can tell you that we're making good progress. We're working closely with our Iraqi partners to ensure that our presence is aligned with their needs and goals.\n\nAnd I'll just add this: we're not going to let the terrorists and the extremists dictate our course of action. We're going to stay the course, working with our Iraqi partners, to help them build a stable and secure country.\n\n( looks at German Chancellor Angela Merkel ) I'm sure the Chancellor will want to add something, but I'll let her speak for herself."

We've got a strong coalition in place, and I want to thank those nations that have dedicated troops, resources, and money to the effort to secure Iraq. While it's true that some nations have chosen to bring their troops home, we're grateful for the contributions they've made so far.\n\nRegarding the 20,000 additional U.S. troops, I am confident that this surge will be successful in achieving its objectives. The goal is to help the Iraqi security forces take control of their country and provide a safe and secure environment for the Iraqi people. It's a difficult challenge, but I have every confidence in the abilities of General Petraeus and his team to carry out the mission.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a complex and difficult endeavor, but I believe the additional troops will give us the flexibility to address the sectarian violence, to improve the security situation, and to give the Iraqi government a chance to succeed. So, I'm optimistic about our chances of success, and I want to assure the American people that our strategy is working."

The U.S. did provide significant support to Pakistan during the Afghan war against the Soviet Union in the 1980s, and I think we worked together to achieve a common goal.\n\nHowever, I understand that after the Soviet withdrawal, our engagement with Pakistan did lessen, and that's a fact that I acknowledge. But I want to assure the people of Pakistan that this time, it's different. Our relationship with Pakistan is a long-term one, it's a relationship based on mutual interest, and mutual respect.\n\nWe are committed to helping Pakistan in its efforts to modernize and to stabilize. We believe that a stable and prosperous Pakistan is in our best interest, as well as the best interest of the region.\n\nSpecifically, we are committed to helping Pakistan in several areas. First, we are providing significant economic assistance to Pakistan, to help the country to modernize its economy and to reduce poverty. We are also providing military assistance to help Pakistan to modernize its military, and to help the country to counter the threat of terrorism.\n\nWe are also working closely with Pakistan to help the country to address the issue of extremism and radicalization, and to help the country to take control of its border regions.\n\nRegarding the issue with India, I think we've made it clear that we want to see good relations between India and Pakistan, and we want to see both countries work together to address their differences peacefully. We believe that a stable and peaceful South Asia is in our best interest, and in the interest of the region.\n\nSo, I want to assure the people of Pakistan that we are committed to our partnership with Pakistan, and we are committed to helping the country to meet its challenges. Thank you."

We've had a long-standing relationship with Turkey, and we'd like to see it continue.\n\nNow, with regards to the northern front, I would not say that it makes it significantly more challenging, but it does make it more complicated. We've got a plan in place, and we're working with our allies to make sure that we achieve our objectives in Iraq. We'll adapt to the situation on the ground as necessary.\n\nRegarding Turkey's entry into the European Union, that's a separate issue, and it's up to the EU to make its decision. The United States supports Turkey's aspiration to join the EU, but that decision is up to the EU. We'll continue to work with our friends in the EU to make sure that they make a decision that's in the best interests of the region.\n\nNow, let me make one thing clear: we expect all our allies, including Turkey, to adhere to the standards of behavior that we expect from our friends. And we'll make our views clear to them, and we'll work with them to address any concerns that we may have. But as for linking the two issues, I would say that's not necessarily the case. We've got to take each issue on its own merits and deal with them accordingly."

We've just received a unanimous vote in the Security Council on the new resolution, which sends a clear signal that the international community is committed to supporting the new government in Iraq.\n\nWe're also seeing a willingness from other countries to step up and play a more prominent role in the training and equipping of Iraqi security forces. We've had conversations with NATO about a potential role for that organization, and I'm optimistic that we'll see more countries come forward in the coming weeks and months with offers of assistance.\n\nAs for major pledges of troops, I'm not necessarily expecting a dramatic increase in the number of troops from other countries. What I am expecting is a more robust and more coordinated effort to support the Iraqi government and security forces as they take on more responsibility for their own security. That may involve more trainers, more advisors, and more logistical support, but we'll see how that unfolds.\n\nNow, regarding the violence, I do expect that there will be attempts by the terrorists and the insurgents to disrupt the transfer of power and to try to intimidate the new government and the Iraqi people. We're taking all necessary steps to prepare for that possibility, and we're confident that the Iraqi security forces, with the support of the coalition, will be able to handle any security challenges that may arise.\n\nBut ultimately, the key is the Iraqi people and their commitment to their own security and their own future. We're seeing a growing sense of optimism and determination among the Iraqi people, and that's the most important thing of all."

    "gen_response": "Well, I appreciate the question. I want to make it clear that our position on Hizballah is that we view them as a terrorist organization, and we believe that their actions are causing harm to innocent people. Now, I know that they call themselves a resistance movement, but we don't see it that way. We see them as a group that is dedicated to violence and terror.\n\nThat being said, we are committed to promoting democracy and freedom in the Middle East, and that includes the people of Lebanon. We want to see a free and independent Lebanon, where all citizens have the right to participate in the democratic process.\n\nNow, as for encouraging parties like Hizballah to discontinue the use of terrorism, we are willing to work with any group that is willing to renounce violence and work towards peaceful means. But we will not negotiate with terrorist organizations. We will not provide them with legitimacy or support.\n\nIf Hizballah were to lay down their arms and work towards a peaceful resolution, we would be willing to work with them in a constructive way. But we will not compromise on our core principles, and we will not tolerate the use of terrorism as a tactic.\n\nI think it's worth noting that we have seen this model work in other parts of the world. For example, in Northern Ireland, we saw a situation where a terrorist organization, the IRA, laid down their arms and worked towards a peaceful resolution. And as a result, we were able to provide support and encouragement to that process.\n\nBut let me be clear: we will not compromise on our values, and we will not tolerate the use of terrorism as a tactic. If Hizballah is serious about becoming a legitimate player in Lebanese politics, they need to make a fundamental choice: they need to choose between the path of violence and the path of peace."

And I'll tell you, I've been dealt some tough ones. But I'm a strong leader, and I'm not afraid to take on tough issues.\n\nNow, on Social Security reform, I believe it's a vital issue that needs to be addressed. The system's got problems, and we need to fix them. But I also understand that it's a complex issue, and it takes time to build consensus. I've been working with members of both parties to try to find common ground, to find a solution that makes sense for the American people.\n\nNow, I know some folks may not agree with my approach, and that's okay. That's the democratic process. But I believe that we're making progress, and I'm committed to continuing to push for reforms that will ensure Social Security is solvent for generations to come.\n\nAnd let me tell you, I'm not just focusing on Social Security. We've made progress on other fronts, too. We've passed a massive tax cut that's helped stimulate economic growth. We've taken steps to reform our intelligence agencies to make sure we're better equipped to deal with the threat of terrorism. And we've made significant progress on education reform, with the passage of No Child Left Behind.\n\nNow, I know I haven't gotten everything done that I wanted to. But that's the nature of the beast, if you will. You've got to work with 535 other folks up here who have their own ideas, and sometimes they don't always agree with yours. But I'm a optimist, and I believe we're making progress.\n\nAnd let me tell you, I've still got a lot of capital left in the bank. I'm not cashed out. I'm still committed to pushing for the policies that I believe are right for America. And I'm gonna keep working, day in and day out, to make sure we get the job done."

But I believe our strategy is sound, and we're making progress in training Iraqi security forces and transferring responsibility to them.\n\nAs for the polls, I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I'm not going to make decisions based on polls. I'm going to make decisions based on what I think is right for the country. And I believe that our mission in Iraq is crucial to the security of the United States and the free world.\n\nNow, I'd like to hear from the Prime Minister. Blair?\n\n(break, then to Prime Minister)\n\nPrime Minister Blair: Thank you, George. Yes, the decline in public support in America for the mission in Iraq is something we take seriously. We understand the concerns that people have, not just in the United States, but in our own country as well. But I want to make it absolutely clear that we also share the same objective as the United States: to help the Iraqi people build a stable and secure democracy. We believe that's in the long-term interests of our own security and that of our citizens.\n\nSo, while we take the decline in public support seriously, it will not deter us from our commitment to this mission.

The situation in Iraq, while challenging, is not a setback to our efforts to promote democracy in the Middle East. In fact, we're seeing real progress in Iraq, and our strategy is to continue to work with the Iraqi people to build a stable, democratic government.\n\nNow, I understand that there are still many challenges ahead, and we're working hard to address them. But the fact remains that Iraq is a nation that's moving towards democracy, and that's a powerful example for the region.\n\nRegarding Syria and Iran, let me be clear: we have concerns about the behavior of those governments, particularly when it comes to their support for terrorism and their pursuit of nuclear capabilities. But we're not going to let that stop us from pushing forward with our agenda of promoting democracy and freedom in the region.\n\nWe believe that the spread of democracy is a powerful force for change, and that as more and more nations in the region adopt democratic values and institutions, the people of the Middle East will begin to see the benefits of freedom and prosperity. And we're committed to supporting that movement, even in the face of resistance from authoritarian regimes.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, I'm not concerned that the Iraq experience is going to embolden authoritarian regimes. I'm confident that our efforts to promote democracy in Iraq and elsewhere will ultimately prevail, and that we'll see a more free and peaceful Middle East as a result.\n\nNext question, please."

First, let me say that we're aware that Fidel Castro has been quite ill for some time now. We're monitoring the situation closely, and while the Cuban government hasn't released much information about his condition, we believe he's in a serious state of health.\n\nRegarding our contingency plans, we have a robust set of policies and procedures in place to address various scenarios that may unfold in the event of a transition in Cuba. Our goal is to support the Cuban people in their pursuit of democracy, freedom, and a better life. We're prepared to provide humanitarian assistance, and we're working closely with our international partners to ensure a peaceful and stable transition.\n\nNow, I understand that the Cuban-American community in this country has strong feelings about returning to their homeland and reclaiming their properties. I want to assure them that we understand and respect those feelings. As we consider any future policies, we'll be taking into account the interests and concerns of Cuban-Americans who've been forced to flee their country.\n\nLet me be clear, though: we will not stabilize a successor regime that doesn't bring about democratic changes, doesn't respect human rights, and doesn't introduce market-oriented economic reforms. Our aim is to support a transition to a free and democratic Cuba, one where the Cuban people can live without fear of persecution, and where they can freely exercise their rights and pursue their dreams.\n\nWe're also mindful that any process of transition will be complex and likely to take time. We're working closely with our friends and allies to ensure that we're prepared for any eventuality, and that we can support the Cuban people as they navigate this critical period in their history.\n\nThank you.

Now, I've been talking to leaders in both parties, and I am aware that it's going to be a challenge to pass it in a lame-duck session, but I'm not ready to give up on it yet.\n\nWe'll just have to see what happens after the elections and where the sponsors of the bill, Senators Kennedy and McCain, and the House representatives, their willingness to try to get it done. I am committed to comprehensive immigration reform, and if we can get it done this year, I'd be happy to sign it into law.\n\nNow, that being said, I believe it's also important to take a look at the broader context of national security and the importance of securing our borders, as well. We've made significant progress in securing our borders, but there's still more work to be done.

First, let me say that the reported nuclear test by North Korea is a grave threat to international security, and it's unacceptable behavior by the regime in Pyongyang. We're working closely with our international partners to address this threat and to respond to it.\n\nRegarding our policy, I strongly disagree with the notion that we took our eye off the ball in North Korea. We have consistently been paying attention to the threat posed by North Korea, and we have taken decisive action to address it.\n\nNow, it's true that we have been focused on the war in Iraq, and I believe that has been a necessary and important effort to spread democracy and freedom in the Middle East. But that didn't mean we took our eye off North Korea. We've been consistently working with our partners in the region, including China and Japan and South Korea, to address the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear program.\n\nAs for whether we could have done more, I think it's easy to second-guess with the benefit of hindsight. But I do believe that we've taken a consistent and strong approach to addressing the North Korean threat, and we're committed to continuing to work with our partners to address it.\n\nAnd let me just say, it's worth noting that the Agreed Framework that my predecessor, President Clinton, put in place, that framework has some flaws, and we've been working to replace it with a more robust agreement that addresses the concerns of all the parties involved. And I believe that we're making progress on that front.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I don't believe that our administration is to blame for letting North Korea get to this point.

They've used those talks to try to weaken our alliances and undermine the international community's efforts to address their nuclear and missile programs.\n\nNow, with regards to Secretary Baker's comments, I appreciate his insight, but I want to make it clear that I'm not going to rule anything out at this point. But I do want to make it very clear that any talks with North Korea must be a serious, credible, and verifiable process. They must be based on the principle that they will denuclearize, that they will give up their nuclear ambitions.\n\nWe cannot engage in talks for the sake of talks. We've tried that before, and it didn't work. Any engagement with North Korea must be based on a clear understanding of their willingness to abandon their nuclear programs.\n\nSo while I'm not closing the door on any possibilities, I want to make it clear that any engagement with North Korea must be grounded in reality and based on clear principles. We can't just spin our wheels and engage in talks that don't produce results. The international community is united in its desire to see a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, and any engagement with North Korea must be guided by that goal."

Now, I understand that the Department of Homeland Security has suggested that a combination of physical barriers and virtual fences can be an effective way to secure our border.\n\nAnd I agree with that assessment. The bill that's on my desk, the Secure Fence Act, provides for the construction of physical barriers, including fencing, in certain areas. But it also allows the Secretary of Homeland Security the flexibility to determine the best way to secure the border, using a combination of physical barriers, technology, and manpower.\n\nSo, while I'm committed to securing our border, I'm also committed to using the most effective tools available to us. And if that means using a combination of fencing and virtual fences, then that's what we'll do. The key is to secure our border, and that's what we're going to do.\n\nAnd I want to emphasize that this is just one part of a comprehensive immigration reform package that includes securing our borders, but also includes a path to citizenship for those who are here, and a guest worker program.

While it's true that the current situation may pose some challenges to their efforts against the Taliban and Al Qaida, I'm encouraged by General Musharraf's commitment to continuing the fight against terrorism.\n\nIt's worth noting that the United States has a strong partnership with Pakistan, and we will continue to work closely with them to address these shared challenges.

She's going to also stress the importance of respecting the rule of law and the human rights of all citizens. Now, I know it's a quick trip, but I think it's an important one, and I'm confident that Secretary Rice will make some headway.\n\nAs for the question of when it takes more active intervention by an American President in trouble spots in Africa, I'd say that each situation is unique, and we have to approach it on a case-by-case basis. In general, I believe that the United States has a responsibility to promote peace, stability, and democracy around the world, and we've been actively engaged in trying to do just that.\n\nBut there are limits to what we can do. We can't impose our will on other countries, and we have to be mindful of our own national interests and security. What we can do is use our influence, our diplomatic efforts, and our economic tools to try to nudge countries towards a more peaceful and democratic path.\n\nNow, in Kenya, I think it's clear that we're at a turning point. The government and the opposition need to come together and find a way forward that's peaceful and respectful of the democratic process. We're working closely with our international partners to support that effort, and I'm hopeful that we can make progress.\n\nBut I'll make one thing clear: the United States will not hesitate to take stronger action if we believe that's what's necessary to protect our interests, protect the interests of the international community, or to prevent humanitarian tragedy. We'll be watching the situation very closely, and we'll be working with our partners to determine the best way forward."

But I still believe that the fundamental strengths of our economy are sound. We've got a resilient workforce, innovation, and entrepreneurship that will carry us through these difficult times.\n\nThat being said, I also said we would carefully monitor the situation, and we are doing so. As for a second stimulus package, I'm not ruling anything out. I have directed the Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary Paulson, to keep reviewing the options and analyze what may be needed to ensure we keep the economy growing. However, we must also be mindful of the long-term implications of increased spending and take a prudent approach.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a time for cautious optimism. We will take the necessary steps to thrive in the global economy, but we'll do it in a way that also addresses the fiscal responsibility. We will continue to urge Congress to pass legislation that will help stimulate job creation and economic growth, like extending the tax cuts or other targeted measures.\n\nI want to emphasize that we're not at all abandoning the notion that we need to get our fiscal house in order. Our economy can't afford more big-spending habits. These are tough decisions, and we'll make them in consultation with experts, but always with the principles of a strong, free-enterprise economy guiding us."

We'll continue to work with the Iraqi government, with the international community, and with our coalition partners to bring stability and security to the region, and to help the Iraqi people build a brighter future for themselves. Next question, please."

I made it clear that our plans for missile defense are not aimed at Russia, but rather at the gathering threats of rogue states. I believe we can work together to address the security concerns of both our nations, and I offered to share some of our technology with Russia.\n\nNow, I think what's important here is that we're seeking a partnership, not a competition. We're seeking to work together to deal with the real threats that we face, and I believe that our cooperation on counter-terrorism, on proliferation, on energy, on a range of fronts can be of great benefit to both our countries.\n\nAnd Vladimir, I'll let you speak to this, your plans and such."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for that question. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify America's position. First and foremost, I believe that the United States has a responsibility to defend its citizens, and we will do what it takes to protect them from the threats of terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nNow, I understand that our European allies may not see eye to eye with us on every issue, and that's okay. But I believe that we have a shared commitment to the values of freedom, democracy, and security. And I believe that when it comes to dealing with rogue regimes that support terrorism and pursue weapons of mass destruction, we should stand together in our opposition.\n\nThat being said, if we can't get the kind of support we need from our allies, the United States will not be deterred from taking action to protect its interests and its people. We will work with whoever is willing to work with us, but we cannot be held back by a lack of support from others. We have a responsibility to our citizens, and we will act in their best interests.\n\nI want to emphasize, though, that we're not looking to go it alone. We believe that a coalition of like-minded nations is the best way to address these challenges. But we will not be deterred from our goal of protecting America and the American people, no matter what."

    "gen_response": "Well, thank you, I appreciate that question. First of all, let me make it clear that the United States is committed to a peaceful resolution in the Middle East. We've been working very closely with all parties involved, including Prime Minister Sharon and the Palestinian leadership, to try to find a way forward that brings an end to the violence and gets us back to the table for negotiations.\n\nNow, I understand that there have been some concerns about the language we used initially, but I want to assure you that we've been consistently clear with the Israeli government about our concerns regarding the incursions into Palestinian territories. As you know, I spoke to Prime Minister Sharon just recently, and I made my position very clear. And I believe that Prime Minister Sharon understands our concerns and our views on this matter.\n\nRegarding the timing of the language, I'd like to say that we've been working this issue very closely, and we've been adjusting our language as necessary to reflect the evolving situation on the ground. Our goal is to find a way to bring an end to the violence and to get the parties back to negotiations, and we're going to continue to work very closely with all parties to try to achieve that goal.\n\nAs for the situation in Lebanon, we're very concerned about the reports of Israeli attacks on southern Lebanon. We're in close contact with the Lebanese government, and we're urging all parties to exercise restraint and to avoid any further escalation.\n\nSo, I don't think it's accurate to say that we've failed to convince Prime Minister Sharon to pull back his troops. We've been working very closely with him, and we'll continue to do so. And we'll continue to speak out clearly and consistently about our concerns regarding the situation in the Middle East."

And I think it's unfair to say that there were intelligence lapses, per se. I think our intelligence agencies did the best they could with the information they had at the time.\n\nRegarding the August 6th memo, I'll tell you, as I've said before, it was a routine report that I was sent, and I think it's important to keep certain of this information, this type of information, classified. It's just that simple.\n\nNow, regarding the commission, I'm not opposed to a commission, per se. What I'm concerned about is that a commission could be used as a way to haze the agencies that are doing a very fine job for our country. I've asked the Senate to work with me to make sure that any investigation that's conducted is done in such a way that it won't compromise our national security.\n\nNow, regarding a regime change in Iraq, I've said what I've said, I mean, I've made it clear that we're interested in removing Saddam Hussein from power. He's a menace to his own people and to the region. The world would be a much more peaceful place without him, so yes, we are working towards that goal by supporting the efforts of the Iraqi opposition and working with our allies to build a coalition to pressure his regime into changing its behavior.\n\nBut I want the American people to understand that, you know, this is a step-by-step process. We're analyzing the situations and making decisions based on the best information we have, and working to safeguard American interests."

He is the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I have every confidence in his ability to do his job. He's a fine man, and a fine public servant.\n\nAs to the specific question you're asking, about whether or not he should recuse himself, I think it's very important to let the ethics guidelines speak for themselves. We've got an ethics process in place, and Harvey Pitt has followed that process.\n\nNow, I will say that Chairman Pitt and I have talked about this, and I have every confidence that he will continue to do the right thing. He's a man of high integrity. Whether or not he chooses to recuse himself, that's a decision for him to make. But I've got confidence in him, and I think he'll make the right decision.\n\nNow, let me just say one other thing, and that is, it's very important for us to stick to the facts in this matter.

The proliferation of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula is a threat not only to our friends and allies, but also to our own national security. We cannot allow North Korea to become a nuclear power.\n\nAnd let me emphasize that we're working hard to resolve this issue through diplomacy. I've instructed my Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, to continue to pursue the six-party talks and work with our partners - China, Japan, South Korea, and Russia - to resolve the issue peacefully.\n\nAs for frustration, I would say that we're engaged, but we're also patient. Diplomacy is often a slow and painstaking process. But our goal remains the same: to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, and we're committed to achieving that goal.\n\nNow, I want to emphasize that our approach is not just focused on North Korea, but also on building strong partnerships in the region. We're working with our friends and allies to strengthen our alliances, and we're continuing to position ourselves for success, should diplomacy fail.\n\nI'd just like to reiterate that our objective is clear, and we're working diligently to achieve it.

    "gen_response": "Thank you for your question. Well, first of all, I'm glad I did make that decision to put Condoleezza Rice in charge of the Iraq policy. I think she's done a fantastic job, and I think our policy's been more coherent, more streamlined, and more effective.\n\nNow, in terms of specific changes, I think one thing is that we've got a more robust interagency process, which means that we're getting better coordination between the different parts of our government. We're not just talking about the State Department, the Defense Department, and the White House; we're also talking about other agencies, like USAID and the Treasury Department. They're all working together more effectively.\n\nSecondly, I think we've got a clearer set of goals and objectives, which are centered around a strategy that trains and equips the Iraqis to take over their own security, so that we can begin to draw down our troop presence. We've also shifted our tactics and strategy to focus on a more flexible approach, which is to find these terrorists and insurgents where they live, so that we can disrupt their networks and their supply lines.\n\nNow, I know that this is still a very difficult and complex situation. We've still got long-term challenges to face. But I do think that since Dr. Rice has taken over, we've made some real progress.\n\nRegarding your second question, I can tell you that our strategy is to get more Iraqis in charge of their own security, so that we can reduce our troop presence. That's our stated goal. And I believe that we are making progress towards that goal. However, I also believe that it's premature to set a specific time or date, when I can promise you that troops will be reduced.\n\nOne thing's for sure \u2013 that we've got to be flexible. We've got to be flexible and adaptable in the face of this threat. But I do think that our strategy is working. We're having success in places like Najaf and Fallujah. We've had successes in terms of apprehending key leaders. And we're continuing to put pressure on these insurgents and terrorists.\n\nSo, I believe that we're making progress. And I believe that we will be able to reduce troop levels, but I'm not going to make a specific promise, because I don't think it's responsible to make predictions in the face of an enemy that's fluid and changing. But we will continue to work towards that goal, and I'm confident that we'll achieve it."

I'm the President, not the politician. And I'm going to keep making the tough decisions to protect this country, no matter what the polls say, no matter what the pundits say, no matter what the press says.\n\nNow, you asked if it would be worth it, even if I lost my job.

    "gen_response": "Well, thank you for that question.  The situation in Iraq is a complex one, and I believe it's got a lot of moving parts.  First and foremost, any decision on martial law would be a decision for the Iraqi government to make, not the United States.  We're there to help the Iraqis achieve their objectives, to help them secure their country, and to help them have a peaceful and prosperous future.\n\nThat being said, the security situation in Iraq is a major concern.  I've been briefed by our generals, by the Secretary of Defense, and by our commander on the ground, and I'm deeply concerned about the security situation.  The Iraqi government and the Iraqi security forces have got a major challenge in front of them.\n\nNow, martial law could be a useful tool in helping to restore order, but I don't want the American people to think that we're going to be the ones who are - we're not going to be the ones who are enforcing, imposing martial law.  That's a decision for the Iraqis to make.\n\nNow, if the Iraqis were to make that decision, it's conceivable that coalition forces would be involved in helping to implement that decision.  But I want to make it clear that we're not going to be the ones making that decision.  This is a sovereign government, and it's their decision to make.\n\nBut I will tell you this:  We're committed to helping the Iraqis achieve their objectives.  We're committed to helping them secure their country.  And we're committed to helping them have a peaceful and prosperous future.  We'll continue to work closely with them to help them make the right decisions about how to restore order and security in their country."

The city of Fallujah has become a safe haven for terrorists, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and his associates. These folks are a threat not only to Iraq's stability, but also to American citizens.\n\nOur mission is to clear the city of these terrorists, to disrupt their operations, to bring them to justice. And we believe that by doing so, we will make the city a safer place for the Iraqi people.\n\nThe stakes are high, indeed. If we allow Fallujah to become a safe haven for terrorists, it will embolden them to continue their brutal attacks on innocent civilians. And it will undermine the progress we've made in Iraq. On the other hand, if we succeed in restoring order to Fallujah, we will send a clear message to the Iraqi people that we are committed to their security and their freedom.\n\nThe elections in January are a critical milestone in Iraq's transition to democracy. And I believe that by taking care of the security situation in Fallujah, we will create a more stable environment for those elections to take place.\n\nI want to thank our men and women in uniform for their bravery and their service. I want to thank our allies for their support. And I want to assure the Iraqi people that we will do everything in our power to help them achieve their dream of a free and peaceful Iraq.\n\nThank you.

And I think it's easy to second-guess somebody's decision, and that's what you're doing here.\n\nI've spoken to Secretary Rumsfeld about this issue. He has explained to me why he made the decision he did, and I trust his judgment. And let me tell you, this man has been a great Secretary of Defense. He's helped me make some very tough decisions, and I appreciate his counsel.\n\nNow, I understand that some may be offended by the fact that he didn't sign every condolence letter. But I think you've got to look at the overall picture of what this man's done. He's a dedicated public servant, and I'm proud to have him on my team.\n\nAnd let me just say this: it's easy to take one mistake, or one decision, and make it seem like it's the only thing that matters.

As you know, I've been urging Congress to take action on this critical issue, and I believe that we can get a bill done this year. \n\nIn terms of a specific timeline, I've always said that I'd like to see significant progress by the end of the summer, and a bill on my desk by the end of the year. Now, I know that's ambitious, but I believe it's achievable. And I think it's essential that we make meaningful strides on this issue, because every year we delay, the problem gets worse.\n\nNow, regarding the issue of personal accounts, I believe that personal accounts are a crucial part of any comprehensive Social Security reform package. They're a way for workers to own a piece of their own retirement savings, to have more control over their own futures. That being said, I'm willing to discuss and debate different ideas, different approaches.\n\nBut I will not support a bill that doesn't address the long-term financial solvency of Social Security. If we don't make changes to the current system, we'll be leaving future generations with a tremendous burden. So, I'm open to talking about different ideas, but I won't support a bill that doesn't address the long-term challenges facing Social Security.\n\nI believe that personal accounts can and should be part of the overall solution, but I'm willing to listen to other ideas, to work with members of Congress, to find a way forward that we can all support.

And some of those predictions turned out to be wrong. But I've always been a firm believer that the Iraqi people had the capacity to govern themselves, and that with the right support, they could build a more democratic and more free society.\n\nI think it's premature to say that we've reached the end of the journey, but I do think that the Iraqi people have made significant progress. And as for vindication, I don't really think that's the right word. What I feel is a sense of pride in the fact that we were able to help the Iraqi people achieve this goal. And I also feel a sense of hope that the spread of democracy in the Middle East will lead to a more peaceful and more stable region.\n\nBut I'll let history judge whether or not the decisions we made were the right ones.

Hamas is a terrorist organization. And, of course, I think it's very important for President Abbas to deal with that group in a way that will show the world that he's committed to fighting terror, that he's committed to peace.\n\nAs for what the Palestinian Authority ought to do, in terms of dealing with Hamas, I think it's very important for the Palestinian Authority to dismantle the terrorist organizations. And that includes the infrastructure of Hamas, the leadership of Hamas. It's very important for them to take a strong stand against terror, and I believe they will.\n\nNow, I'm not going to dictate to the Palestinian Authority how they should do their business.

We've got a lot of talented people who are focused on the issues that matter most to the American people.\n\nI'd say the nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court is a great example of that.

They are constitutional, and they're necessary.\n\nNow, I've given these authorities a lot of thought. The reason I've given them thought is because I understand we're at war. 9/11 changed the world.

It's not just a matter of national security, it's a matter of international stability.\n\nMake no mistake, we take this threat very seriously, and we're working closely with our allies and partners to address it. If North Korea were to go ahead with a test, we would view it as a highly provocative act, and we would respond accordingly.\n\nAs for penalties, I think it's clear that the international community would need to take strong action to demonstrate our collective disapproval. This could include economic sanctions, through the United Nations or through bilateral actions, to pressure the regime in Pyongyang to change its behavior.\n\nBut let me be clear: we're not looking for confrontation.

I understand that there's been some controversy, some important questions that need to be answered.\n\nI've met with Alberto Gonzales about these issues, and I've told him to go out and find out the facts, to lay out all the facts, be as open and transparent as possible.

I've made it clear to him that he needs to be as open as possible, to be as transparent as possible, to make sure that the American people have confidence in him.\n\nNow, I know there's been some bumps along the way, but I've got confidence in Alberto's ability to make things right. And I believe that he will be able to continue to serve the American people as a fine Attorney General.\n\nLet me just add one thing: I don't think it's proper for us to jump to conclusions about Alberto's future until all the facts are known. Let's find out what the facts are, and then we'll make judgments based upon those facts."

But as we get closer to the elections, I worry that the rhetoric's going to get hotter and the politics is going to get more intense. I've been in office long enough to know that politics ain't always pretty, but I'm urging both sides to put aside their differences and focus on what's best for the country.\n\nWe can't afford to let this issue get stuck in the trenches of politics. We've got to be guided by a sense of what's right and what's fair for the American people. I'm confident that we can get this done, and I'm committed to working day and night to see it through.\n\nNow, I know some folks might say, \"Mr. President, you're a lame duck.\" But I'm here to tell you, I'm not a lame duck.

However, I must respectfully disagree with your assessment of the situation. This is not a war of my choosing; it is a war to protect the American people, and our friends and allies, from the threat of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.\n\nRegarding the role of al-Qaeda in Iraq, I agree that their presence has grown, but that is precisely because of the environment created by Saddam Hussein's regime. Saddam's support for terrorist groups and his efforts to destabilize the region created a situation that drew in extremist elements.\n\nAs for bringing in UN peacekeepers, I appreciate the idea of international participation, but it's not simply a matter of bringing in peacekeepers. The security situation on the ground requires a more comprehensive approach. We're working with the Iraqi government, our coalition partners, and the international community to establish stability, build Iraqi security forces, and facilitate economic development.\n\n(leaning forward, firmly)\n\nI will not be swayed by the prospect of negation or hesitation. We have a clear strategy to achieve our objectives, and we will see it through to its conclusion. We will work with the international community to find solutions, but we will not cow to the demands of the media or other critics. I am the Commander-in-Chief of this nation's military, and I will not accept the defeatism and lack of resolve that seems to pervade so much of the critics' thinking.\n\n(folding my arms, surveying the room)"

The EU is one of our closest allies and trading partners, and we have a deep and abiding relationship based on shared values and interests.\n\nThat being said, we do expect the EU to be a strong and responsible global partner. We will continue to engage with the EU on key issues such as trade, security, and counter-terrorism, and we will work to strengthen our bilateral relationships with individual European countries.\n\nAs for our engagement in Europe, I can assure you that we will not decrease our commitment to the region. We will continue to work closely with our European allies on a range of issues, including NATO, counter-terrorism, and non-proliferation. Our engagement in Europe is critical to our national security and economic interests, and we will continue to prioritize it.\n\nHowever, we do hope that the EU will remain committed to the principles of free and fair trade, and that it will not seek to create unnecessary barriers or protectionist policies that could harm our bilateral relationship or the global economy.\n\nOverall, I believe a stronger, more united European Union can be a positive force for global stability and prosperity, and we look forward to working with our European partners to promote our shared interests and values.

While it's true that we did consider a wide range of options in the aftermath of those attacks, our primary focus was on addressing the threat of terrorism and the organization that perpetrated those heinous acts, al-Qaeda.\n\nNow, I did assign the Secretary of Defense, Don Rumsfeld, to examine the options for dealing with Iraq, as well as other countries that could potentially harbor terrorists. But I want to assure you that our approach was not to rush to war. We spent many months gathering intelligence, building international coalitions, and pursuing diplomatic options.\n\nLet's be clear: our primary goal was to disarm Saddam Hussein's regime and bring him into compliance with the international community. We pursued a number of diplomatic avenues, including working with the United Nations, to achieve that goal.\n\nNow, I understand that Bob Woodward's book presents one interpretation of events, but I can assure you that we explored all options, including diplomatic efforts, to address the threat posed by Saddam's regime. This was not a charade, Nick. This was a serious and considered process to address a real and legitimate threat to our national security.\n\nI hope that helps clarify the record.

I've had productive discussions with President Putin, and I'm encouraged by our shared commitment to tackling global challenges, such as counter-terrorism and non-proliferation.\n\nNow, I'd like to address your second question. Our actions in Iraq have been guided by a deep commitment to freedom, security, and democracy. We'll continue to work closely with the international community, including the United Nations, to promote peace and stability in Iraq.\n\nHowever, I also believe that the United States must reserve the right to act in its own national security interests.

    "gen_response": "(clears throat) Thank you for that question. I appreciate the opportunity to address these concerns. First of all, let me say that the critics who say we allowed the 9/11 threat to mature too far are, in hindsight, correct. We did receive intelligence warnings, but we didn't have the luxury of connecting the dots in time. We had a wall of separation between law enforcement and intelligence, and it hindered our ability to share information effectively. We've since taken significant steps to address those shortcomings, and I'm proud of the progress we've made in reforming our intelligence agencies.\n\nRegarding Iraq, I understand that some folks feel we acted too hastily. However, I still firmly believe that the threat posed by Saddam Hussein was real, and the intelligence we had at the time supported that assessment. While the WMDs we feared were not found, we did discover a terror-sponsor state with a regime that was a destabilizing force in the region.\n\nAs for the appropriate threat level to justify action in the future, I believe it's essential to consider the new global landscape we're operating in. The 9/11 attacks taught us that our enemies are no longer just states but also non-state actors, like terrorists, who can wreak havoc on our nation.\n\nIn the face of such threats, we need to adopt a prudent yet proactive posture. We must be willing to take bold action when the threat is imminent and credible. However, we must also ensure that our actions are carefully calibrated and that we're working with international partners whenever possible.\n\nI'd say that the key threshold for action should be when a threat is \"gathering\" \u2013 that is, when the pieces are coming together to a point where intervention is necessary to prevent a significant loss of life, destabilization of a region, or the emergence of a rogue state. It's not just about \"gathering\" intelligence; it's about connecting those threads to our overall strategic objectives.\n\nWe'll always have to balance the imperative of protecting the American people with the imperative of upholding our values and respecting the sovereignty of other nations. These are not mutually exclusive goals; in fact, they're complimentary. We must continually calibrate and re-examine our threat tolerance to address the ever-changing landscape of the 21st century.\n\nWe will continue to work with Congress, the international community, and other stakeholders to ensure that our approach to these complex challenges is as thoughtful, effective, and proportionate as possible."

However, I must respectfully disagree with his assessment that we didn't plan properly for the postwar period in Iraq.\n\nWe did have a plan, and it was a plan that was widely debated and discussed within the administration. The State Department, led by Secretary Colin Powell, and our coalition partners, all played a role in developing that plan. The Coalition Provisional Authority, which was established by Ambassador Paul Bremer, was working to establish a stable and democratic Iraq.\n\nHowever, we did face some unexpected challenges on the ground. The insurgency was more fierce and more determined than we anticipated. We also faced some unforeseen challenges in terms of Iraq's infrastructure and its bureaucracy.\n\nBut I would argue that our commitment to Iraq has been strong, and our support for the Iraqi people has been unwavering. We've made significant progress in training and building up the Iraqi security forces, and we're going to continue to support them as they take on more responsibility for their own security.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Prime Minister's comments were not the first time we've heard concerns about our planning and execution in Iraq. We've heard them from members of Congress, from other foreign leaders, and from many of our own citizens. And we take all of these concerns seriously.\n\nBut I believe that history will show that our decision to liberate Iraq was the right one, and that our efforts to help the Iraqi people build a new and better future for themselves will be seen as a noble and necessary endeavor."

Yesterday, the Vice President was discussing the threat posed by Saddam Hussein and the fact that he's a sponsor of terror.

We don't have direct evidence of that, but I don't think that necessarily, one has to see something in order to know that there's, that there's some, that there's some very strong connections.\n\nSo, while the relationship between Saddam and Al Qaida and the degree, some sensibilities, are sensitive intelligence and I...

Let me tell you, I'm committed to making sure we have the resources we need to enforce these new standards and protect American investors.\n\nI believe that the proposals I've put forward are a good start, but I'm also a realist \u2013 I know that we may need to revisit the funding level to ensure that we're truly effective in rooting out corporate wrongdoing and holding accountable those who engage in it. So, I'm open to working with Congress to make sure we get it right. The American people deserve nothing less."

We've had some discussions with our Mexican counterparts about, you know, migration, and how to make the border more secure, but we've also talked about migration patterns, and the idea of working towards a comprehensive reform of our immigration system.\n\nAnd I appreciate President Carter's input on this matter. He's a man of great compassion and experience, and I respect his views. As for amnesty, I believe it's an idea worth considering, but it's not that simple. We have to make sure that any solution we come up with is fair, that it's humane, and that it upholds the law.\n\nI've said before that I believe we need a comprehensive immigration reform that includes tightening our borders, cracking down on employers who hire undocumented workers, and providing a pathway to citizenship for those who are already here, working hard, paying taxes, and contributing to our society.\n\nNow, I know there's a lot of different opinions on this issue, and we're going to continue to have a healthy debate about it. But I'm willing to work with Congress, with our Mexican counterparts, and with other stakeholders to find a solution that's in the best interest of America and in the best interest of our relationship with Mexico.\n\nAnd I'll tell you this: we're not just going to focus on the presence of these workers; we're also going to focus on the conditions that drive them to leave their homes in the first place. We're going to work with Mexico to strengthen their economy, to provide more opportunities for their citizens, so they don't feel like they have to come to the United States to find work.\n\nSo, that's where we are, and we'll continue to work on this issue and see where we can find common ground."

As I said earlier, Poland has been a leader in the region, and its contributions to the global war on terror and its efforts to promote democracy and stability in places like Bosnia and Kosovo are truly commendable.\n\nRegarding Poland's role in Central and Eastern Europe, I believe this nation is poised to play a vital part in this region's economic and security development. As a proud member of NATO, Poland's participation in the alliance is a testament to its commitment to peace and stability. We're also working closely with Poland to strengthen its borders, particularly with regard to issues like energy security and counter-terrorism efforts.\n\nAs we move forward in this region, Poland will continue to be a crucial partner in our efforts to promote democratic values and economic cooperation. We're exploring ways to deepen our bilateral relationship with Poland, including through the proposed U.S.-Poland free trade agreement. This agreement will not only boost economic growth but also solidify our strong alliance.\n\nSpecifically, we believe Poland's unique position between Eastern and Western Europe gives it a critical role in bridging the gaps between the United States and Russia. Poland and Russia have a long and complex history, and we understand that improving relations between the two nations will take time. However, we encourage both countries to engage in constructive dialogue and to cooperate in areas like economy, education, and counter-terrorism.\n\nWe appreciate Poland's commitment to a unified and democratic Europe, and we're confident that its continued leadership will help drive progress in the region."

Now, I understand that there's a sense of, uh, frustration and concern among the European public, and I understand that.\n\nBut let me be clear: we're makin' progress in Iraq. The Iraqi people have just held successful elections, and they're beginnin' to take control of their country. We're also makin' progress on the security front, with the Iraqi security forces gettin' stronger every day.\n\nNow, as for our role in Iraq, I believe it's essential that we continue to provide support to the Iraqi government, especially in terms of security and military training. We've got a solemn obligation to help the Iraqi people protect themselves against the terrorists and insurgents who are tryin' to undermine their democracy.\n\nBut I also understand that the Iraqis want more control over their own country, and we're workin' with 'em to transfer responsibility to them as quickly as possible. We're trainin' their military, we're helpin' 'em build up their government, and we're graduatin' responsibility to 'em as we make progress.\n\nNow, I'm open to discussin' with our European allies how we can work together to support the Iraqi government and the Iraqi people. But I'm not gonna tie the hands of our military commanders on the ground. They need to have the flexibility to respond to the changin' circumstances on the ground.\n\nSo, I'm lookin' forward to some good discussions with our European friends, but I'm also gonna make it clear that we've got a strategy for success in Iraq, and we're gonna stay the course."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question. I appreciate your interest in this matter. First, let me just say that I'm disappointed that we weren't able to get the intelligence reform bill through. I think it's a crucial piece of legislation, and I think it's essential for the safety and security of the American people.\n\nRegarding Secretary Rumsfeld's involvement, I think it's unfair to say that he's partly responsible for the bill's failure. The Secretary has been a strong supporter of intelligence reform, and he's worked hard to help us pass this bill. Now, I know there were some disagreements, particularly with regard to new intelligence oversight mechanisms and the Pentagon's role, but that's just the way the legislative process works.\n\nAs for me, personally, I think I did everything I could to help pass this bill. I met with Congressional leaders, I spoke to members of both parties, and I made it clear how important this legislation was to me and to the country. Now, I'm the first to admit that I'm not a legislator, I'm the President, and sometimes that means you've got to rely on other people to get the job done.\n\nAnd as for my ability to achieve my legislative agenda over the next two years, I'm not worried. I've got a strong track record of getting things done, and I'm confident that we'll be able to work with Congress to pass other important legislation, whether it's on Social Security reform, or tort reform, or any of the other issues that are important to the American people.\n\nBut I will say this: I'm not going to give up on intelligence reform. We're going to keep pushing, we're going to keep working, and we're going to get this done. Because I believe it's essential for the security of our country, and I believe it's essential for the confidence of the American people. Thank you."

As you know, our coalition, including the Australians, has made significant progress in both Iraq and Afghanistan. However, the fight against terrorism and the establishment of stable democracies in these countries will undoubtedly take time. \n\nI must give credit to the bravery and dedication of the Australian troops, who have worked tirelessly alongside our forces to put pressure on the insurgency. While it's difficult to predict an exact timeline, I do believe that our continued cooperation will lead to a more secure environment in the region.\n\nIn terms of a timeline, I'm not willing to give the enemy a specific date for withdrawal. That would only play into their hands. What I can say, however, is that our commitment to the people of Iraq and Afghanistan will continue until we've accomplished our goals.\n\nWe'll continue to work closely with the Iraqi government to build their capacity to secure their own country, and with the government of Afghanistan to bring stability to their nation. It's also worth noting that Australia has been a vital partner in our efforts to train Iraqi security forces, and their efforts have been invaluable.\n\nPrime Minister Howard and I will continue to work together to adjust our strategy as necessary, and we will also be guided by the conditions on the ground. We're making progress, and I believe that one day, we'll be able to stand down our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, knowing that we've left behind countries that are more stable and more secure. But for now, I think it's fair to say that we'll be committed to this effort for some time to come."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for that question. I understand the concerns about the cost of this recovery effort, and I appreciate the vigilance of the American people when it comes to the nation's finances.\n\nLet me be clear: the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina is a national emergency, and it requires a national response. We're not just talking about rebuilding homes and infrastructure; we're talking about saving lives, supporting our fellow citizens, and ensuring the economic stability of our nation.\n\nNow, as for the cost, I believe it's a necessary investment in the future of our country. We're not going to nickel and dime our response to this disaster. We're going to do what it takes to get the job done, and then we'll work together with Congress to figure out how to pay for it.\n\nAs for the national debt, I understand that it's a concern. But let me remind you that during times of war and national emergency, it's not uncommon for the country to take on additional debt. What's important is that we're transparency and accountability in our spending, and that we work towards a balanced budget over the long term.\n\nWe'll work with Congress to pass a supplemental appropriations bill to provide the necessary funds for this relief effort. And we'll work to identify cost-savings and budget adjustments to offset the costs of this effort. We'll also be looking at proposals to reform the tax code and make it more efficient, as well as supporting the growth of the economy, which will help to generate revenue to cover some of these costs.\n\nSo, to answer your question, it's going to take a collective effort \u2013 both from the federal government, the states, and the private sector \u2013 to pay for this recovery. And we'll work together to ensure that it's done in a responsible and fiscally sound manner."

And that's why I'm working closely with the international community to apply diplomatic pressure on Syria, who's a main sponsor of Hizballah, and to press the Lebanese government to assert its authority and control over its own borders and its own territory.\n\nI also believe that we need to support the people of Lebanon, who are being held hostage by Hizballah's actions. We need to support their efforts to rebuild their country, and we need to help them strengthen their government so they can deal with the internal security threats. \n\nAnd I also believe that we need to make it clear to the leaders of Hizballah, as well as to their sponsors in Iran and Syria, that they will be held accountable for their actions. We'll be working with the international community to further isolate Hizballah and its sponsors, and to ensure that they're held accountable for their actions.\n\nThis is a difficult situation, but I am confident that with a concerted effort, with a clear and consistent message, and with support from the international community, we can get Hizballah to accept a ceasefire, to release the Israeli prisoners, and to disarm, as demanded by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559.\n\nIsrael has the right to defend itself, and it is going to exercise that right. But our strategy is not just to support Israel, it's also to bring peace to the region. We're working to create a situation in which all countries, all parties, can feel secure, and where the people can live in peace."

The anniversary of Hurricane Katrina is a somber reminder of the devastating impact that storm had on the people of Louisiana, particularly in New Orleans. We've made a commitment to the people of the Gulf Coast to help them rebuild their lives and their communities.\n\nOver the past year, we've taken some significant steps. First, we've made a major investment in the levee system. We've committed over $7 billion to repairing and upgrading the levees in New Orleans, to make sure that they're safe and secure. We've also taken steps to improve the Army Corps of Engineers' ability to respond to future disasters.\n\nWe've also made significant progress on housing. We've demolished over 25,000 homes that were severely damaged, and we've made funds available to help families rebuild or get back into their homes. We've also made over $11 billion available to the state of Louisiana and other affected areas to help rebuild their infrastructure and their communities.\n\nBut I'll be the first to tell you that there's still a lot of work to be done. We've got to continue to work with the state and local governments to make sure that the recovery efforts are effective and that the needs of the people are being met.\n\nWe've also got to continue to address the issue of affordable housing. We've made some progress on this front, but it's still a challenge, particularly in New Orleans.\n\nAnd we've got to continue to support the economy. The Gulf Coast was hit hard by this storm, and we've got to make sure that we're doing everything we can to support the local businesses and to encourage investment in the region.\n\nSo, while we've made some progress, I'll be the first to tell you that we've still got a lot of work ahead of us. And we're committed to seeing this through and making sure that the people of the Gulf Coast get the support they need to rebuild their lives."

First of all, let me just say, Jim Baker is a good friend of mine, and I respect his opinion, but I must respectfully disagree with him on this point. Iran is a country that is pursuing a nuclear weapon, and that's unacceptable to the United States of America.\n\nAs for working with them, we have made it clear that we are willing to talk to the Iranians, but we're not going to do it in a way that is going to legitimize their pursuit of a nuclear weapon. And I'm also mindful that the Iranian government has been a destabilizing force in the region, and we're not going to reward that kind of behavior.\n\nNow, when it comes to Iraq, I will pursue any avenue that will help us succeed in Iraq, and if that means talking to the right people, including Iran, about how to help stabilize the region, that's something we'll consider. But what I'm not going to do is I'm not going to compromise our principles, I'm not going to compromise our values, and I'm not going to compromise our national security.\n\nAnd let me just say, it's interesting that Iran would talk to us about Iraq when they're not even willing to come to the table to discuss their own pursuit of a nuclear weapon. That just doesn't seem like a credible or serious approach to me."

    "gen_response": "(The room falls silent as I take a moment to consider my response)\n\nWell, thank you for that question. I appreciate the opportunity to address the points you've raised. First, let me make it clear: we have made significant progress in Iraq since the invasion. The removal of Saddam Hussein and the establishment of a democratically-elected government are major achievements.\n\nHowever, I do acknowledge that the situation in Iraq is more complex and challenging than we anticipated. The insurgency has proven to be a formidable foe, and the sectarian violence has caused significant instability. That's why we're working closely with the Iraqi government to develop a comprehensive strategy to address these issues.\n\nRegarding the Baker-Hamilton report, I've had a chance to review the recommendations, and while I appreciate the efforts of the commission, I disagree with some of the conclusions. Specifically, I do not believe that direct engagement with Syria and Iran at this time would be productive. Those countries have shown no willingness to support our efforts to bring stability to the region, and we cannot afford to give them a veto over our policies.\n\nAs for the recommendation to withdraw combat troops by 2008, I believe it's premature to set a specific timeline for withdrawal. We need to be guided by conditions on the ground, not by artificial deadlines. Our military commanders will continue to assess the situation and make recommendations to me based on the security needs of Iraq.\n\nMake no mistake, we are committed to supporting the Iraqi government and people, and we will do what's necessary to help them achieve stability and security. But we will not be dictated to by a specific timeline or by the machinations of our adversaries. We will act in the best interests of the United States and our allies."

He's a man who has given his word that he's committed to fighting extremism and terrorism, just like we are. And I believe him. He understands the threat that we all face, and he's committed to helping us deal with it.\n\nNow, I've also made it abundantly clear to the President that we expect him to honor the commitments that he's made, and that includes, of course, restoring democracy in Pakistan. I'm a strong believer in democracy, and I'm a strong believer in President Musharraf's ability to lead a democratic Pakistan.\n\nNow, regarding the, the distractions in Pakistan, and their impact on Afghanistan... well, I'm concerned about the situation in Pakistan. But I also have confidence in the leadership of the Pakistani military, as well as the leadership of the Pakistani intelligence services, to stay focused on the threat. And, of course, we're working closely with our Pakistani counterparts to help them deal with the threat.\n\nLet me just make one thing very clear: The United States is committed to helping Pakistan defeat the Taliban and al-Qaeda, not just for Pakistan's sake, but for our own security. And I'm confident that we can work together to achieve that goal.\n\nAnd secondly, regarding Secretary Gates's comments, I think they were appropriate. He's simply stating the obvious, that the more attention, the more resources the Pakistanis have to devote to their internal problems, the less attention and resources they may have to devote to some of their external security challenges, including, of course, the ones they face along their border with Afghanistan.\n\nBut I think we can work through this. I think we can work closely with the Pakistanis to address their internal challenges and also ensure that they stay focused on the threat posed by extremists and terrorists. And that's exactly what we'll do."

Our message to the Turkish government has been clear: we understand their concerns about the PKK, a terrorist organization that they have to deal with, but they need to be mindful of the impact of their actions on the region as a whole.\n\nAs for the duration of the operation, we would like to see it brought to a close as quickly as possible. We're urging Turkey to work with the Iraqi government to address their concerns about the PKK in a way that minimizes the disruption to the region. We're committed to helping to support Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nRegarding the potential for further destabilization, that's a concern that we have. A protracted presence in northern Iraq could indeed have unpredictable consequences, and we're worried about the impact on the region as a whole. We're in close communication with both the Turkish government and the Iraqi government, urging them to work together to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.\n\nNow, I want to emphasize that our relationship with Turkey is very important, it's a strategic relationship, and we value our friendship with the Turkish people. At the same time, we also have a strong commitment to the people of Iraq, and we're working hard to help them build a stable, secure, and prosperous future."

And I believe that the FISA legislation we've proposed is necessary to protect our citizens from the threat of terrorism.\n\nNow, I don't think it's productive to engage in a hypothetical discussion about whether or not we'll be attacked. What I do know is that the threat is real, and it's ongoing. We've seen what happened on 9/11, and we've seen the plots that have been disrupted since then. And we must do everything in our power to prevent another attack.\n\nI'm not basing this on the idea that we'll get attacked or won't get attacked. I'm basing it on the fact that we have a duty to protect the American people, and that we have to be prepared to take the steps necessary to do so.\n\nNow, I believe that this legislation is a responsible and reasonable response to the threat we face. And I'm willing to work with the Democrats to address their concerns, but I also expect them to take this threat seriously and to be willing to take the necessary steps to protect our country.\n\nIt's not a game of wait and see, it's a serious issue that requires a serious response.

And I thought it was important for the credibility of the world to have a united front in dealing with a rogue regime like Saddam Hussein.\n\nNow, I think it's also important to remember, history will look back on this, and I think it's worth reminding the American people, we didn't invent the concept of there being WMD, that was briefed to us by the CIA, and other agencies.

And also, it's easy to speculate. And hindsight is 20/20, as you know, and I found myself in a sink-or-swim situation for a while there. But I was pleased with the surge in '07 and '08, the way General Petraeus implemented the changes he wanted made."

I expect all members of my team to uphold the highest standards of ethics and integrity, and I will not tolerate any behavior that falls short of those standards.\n\nRegarding the criticism that our administration retaliates against those who disagree with us, I'd like to say that that's simply not true. We are committed to an open and honest discussion with the American people, and we value dissenting voices. While we may disagree with those who disagree with us, we respect their right to express their opinions.\n\nHowever, I will say that when an individual is found to have leaked classified information, which puts our national security at risk, that's a serious matter. It's not about retaliation; it's about accountability and the rule of law. We will take all necessary steps to protect our national security and uphold the law.\n\nWe'll see how the investigation unfolds, and I'm confident that justice will be served.

We want to support the new Iraqi government in its efforts to provide stability, security, and accountability.\n\nAs for the question of execution, I think it's fair to say that the punishment has got to be a response to the severity of the crimes, and we have tragically gained a lot of information about what this man was capable of in terms of the mass executions and the discovery of the graves. But it's up to the Iraqi people to decide what will be the proper punishment, and we will support them in their decision."

The situation in Northern Ireland is indeed a very important issue, and I want to commend President Clinton for his efforts in helping to bring about the Good Friday Agreement. That was a significant achievement, and we're going to continue to support the process.\n\nAs for where it sits on my list of priorities, I'd say it's very high. We believe that the progress that's been made in Northern Ireland can serve as a model for other conflict resolution efforts around the world, including the Middle East. The fact that former enemies can come together, talk, and work towards a common goal is a powerful lesson.\n\nNow, I know the Middle East is a very, very difficult situation, with deep-seated issues and emotions. But I believe that the principles of diplomacy, dialogue, and mutual respect that drove the Northern Ireland process can be applied elsewhere. So, while the specifics may be different, the idea that you can bring people together to work towards peace is something that we'll continue to push for.\n\nWe're committed to supporting the people of Northern Ireland as they move forward, and we're going to be actively engaged in helping to find a peaceful resolution to the conflicts in the Middle East. It's a tough road ahead, but I'm optimistic that, with persistence and dedication, we can make progress.\""

I believe that freedom, human rights, the rule of law, and transparency are fundamental to a functioning democracy. And those values aren't just American values, they're universal values that apply to every human being.\n\nNow, I know that every country has its own unique history, its own unique culture, and its own unique circumstances. And I'm not naive enough to think that every country is going to adopt our system, the American system, lock, stock, and barrel. But I do believe that there are certain fundamental principles that should apply to every country, regardless of its history, culture, or circumstances.\n\nThe idea that there's no standard for democracy is, I think, a flawed idea. I think that's the kind of relativism that can lead to a watering down of the values that we hold dear. And I'm not willing to accept that. I believe that we should strive for the highest standards, the highest ideals, when it comes to democracy.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean that every country is going to get there in the same way or at the same time. But I do believe that we should be pushing, that we should be encouraging, that we should be helping countries to move towards those universal values of democracy.\n\nAnd I think that's exactly what we're doing, whether it's in the Middle East, whether it's in Eastern Europe, or whether it's in other parts of the world. We're working with countries to help them build strong, stable, democratic institutions that will serve the needs of their people.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I don't think that standards for democracy should be flexible. I think that we should be pushing for the highest standards, and I think that's what the American people expect us to do."

However, I will reiterate that any interrogation techniques employed by any U.S. agency, including the CIA, will always be in compliance with U.S. law and international obligations.\n\nNow, I want to emphasize that the United States stands strongly against torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment. We do not condone it, we will not tolerate it, and our interrogations will always be humane and in compliance with U.S. law and our international obligations."

As you know, the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative is a vital part of our efforts to secure our borders and protect our citizens from the threat of terrorism.\n\nIn essence, the initiative requires that by the end of 2006, travelers between Canada and the United States will need to present a passport or other secure documents, such as a passport card or an enhanced driver's license, to enter the United States by land or sea. This is an effort to standardize and strengthen the documentation requirements for crossing our shared border.\n\nNo this isn't the first time both countries have worked on more standardized and secure crossings have happened as the two nations have in the past teamed up on things like a trusted traveler program known as NEXUS.\n\nAs for the potential economic impact, I want to emphasize that this initiative is not intended to impede the flow of legitimate travel and trade between our two great nations. We value our relationship with Canada and recognize the importance of our economic partnership. In fact, we believe that a more secure and efficient border will ultimately benefit both our countries by facilitating the movement of people and goods.\n\nHowever, if Canada does not meet the deadline, it could lead to delays and disruptions at our border crossings, which could have negative economic consequences. It's in the interest of both our countries to work together to implement this initiative in a way that minimizes disruptions and supports our shared goal of enhancing security while facilitating legitimate travel and trade.\n\nWe're working closely with our Canadian partners to ensure a smooth transition and to address any concerns they may have. We're also committed to providing ample notice and education to travelers about the new requirements, so that everyone can be prepared.\n\nIn the end, we believe that this initiative will make our borders more secure, while also supporting the strong economic ties between our two nations. Thank you."

It's a delicate balance, I know. But I believe that's the right approach.\n\nNow, as for Russia, I've had some frank discussions with President Putin on this issue, and I think we'll work to try to persuade them of the merits of a strong resolution.

We've been waiting for answers for a long time, and we believe it's time for them to get serious.\n\nNow, as for negotiations before a final answer, we're willing to listen to what they have to say, but we're not willing to negotiate while the enrichment continues. We believe that's a contradictory message, and it's not how you build trust.\n\nWe're serious about a diplomatic solution, but the Iranians have to be serious about it, too. We can't have it both ways. They can't be enriching uranium and claiming they're willing to negotiate. The two messages don't match.\n\nWe're still hopeful that they'll change their behavior and choose a path of cooperation.

It's a resolution that calls for an end to the violence, a call for a ceasefire, and a framework for moving forward. We're working with our international partners to make sure that this resolution is implemented in a way that brings stability to the region.\n\nNow, regarding the specific point you raised about the withdrawal of Israeli troops, I think it's a topic that's open to discussion. However, we must also consider the concerns of Israel, particularly when it comes to her security. The withdrawal of Israeli troops must be done in a way that ensures that there is no vacuum created that would allow for Hizballah or other extremist groups to exploit.\n\nAs for Secretary Rice's contact with Speaker Berri, I think it's safe to say that we'll be in communication with all parties involved to find a resolution to this conflict. Secretary Rice has been in contact with a wide range of leaders in the region, and I'm sure she'll continue to be in contact with Speaker Berri and others to find a way forward.\n\nBut I want to emphasize that we must not give in to the demands of Hizballah, which is a terrorist organization.

We believe that a strong and effective UN is essential for maintaining international peace and security.\n\nBut we also believe that the UN must be willing to adapt and reform to meet the challenges of the 21st century. And, at times, this requires us to take steps that may not be universally agreed upon.\n\nNow, when I go to the UN next week, I will be speaking to a global audience about the need for collective action on some of the world's most pressing challenges, including terrorism, poverty, and the spread of WMDs.

However, in this case, I believe it's essential to consider the context of Iran's current behavior and leadership.\n\nWhile it's true that past Presidents engaged in face-to-face talks with the Soviet Union, those were often conducted within a framework of established diplomatic channels, reciprocal concessions, and clear goals for the negotiations. Furthermore, the Soviet Union's malevolent actions were largely aimed at containment and expansion within the sphere of the Cold War.\n\nIn Iran's case, we have a nation that sponsors terrorism, defies the international community on the nuclear issue, and mistreats its own citizens. These actions pose a direct and unpredictable threat to our allies, partners, and ultimately, to the United States itself.\n\nI will reiterate that we're willing to engage in diplomatic talks, but it has to be done in a manner that does not legitimize bad behavior, that does not obscure the gravity of this threat, and that advances the United States' national security interests. What we cannot afford to do is participate in empty symbolic gestures without the genuine prospect of meaningful concessions from the other side.\n\nI'd be open to direct diplomacy with the Iranian leadership if there is some sort of convincing evidence, or promise, of a fundamental shift in their posture and a willingness to abandon their supreme goal of obtaining nuclear capabilities."

In other words, we want them to verifiably suspend their enrichment activities.\n\nNow, in terms of the military option, all options are on the table.

And I believe that.\n\nBut as I also said in my first term, it's unrealistic to think that the solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is going to be a total and complete withdrawal back to the '67 lines. That's just not going to happen. And it's not going to happen for a reason: because there will be parts of the West Bank that are likely to be part of a sovereign Israel, a sovereign Israel with secure borders.\n\nNow, I'm not trying to prejudge the outcome of final-status talks, but I do think that it's necessary to recognize that there will be some sort of territorial adjustment that's going to have to take place. And I think that it's very important to acknowledge that reality.\n\nIn terms of the settlements themselves, I've made it clear that I do not support the expansion of settlements, and I think that the expansion of settlements would be a mistake.

That's not the model that the United States has chosen, and we've got to make that clear.\n\nAs for the impact on relations between our two countries, I think it's evident that the actions taken by President Putin's government have created some tension.

This is not a \"circumvention\" of FISA; it's actually a robust program that allows us to go after the enemy. I believe we have a duty to our citizens to do everything in our power to protect them.\n\nBut, let me be clear: we're not spying on American citizens. We're monitoring phone calls, and other communications from individuals who are most likely to be involved in terrorist activities. And, the only way we can do that is if we're able to, in real time, gather information. It's all part of the ongoing effort to protect the American people.\n\nNow, I understand there are concerns about civil liberties, and I share those concerns. But, we've already seen that our terror courts and judges have many, many mechanisms in place to prevent any kind of abuses. And, in my view, that's working."

I don't think it's the right way to address the issue. You see, I believe that if you tax their profits, it'll just lead to higher gas prices for the consumer. It's just simple economics.\n\nNow, I do get frustrated when I see oil companies making record profits, while American families are feeling the pinch at the pump. That's the kind of thing that gets my attention, and I'd like to think that we can find a solution that encourages energy companies to work with the American people, not just their shareholders.\n\nMy approach is to focus on increasing production, both foreign and domestic. We need to find more oil and gas, but also invest in alternative energy sources. And I think we need to get America to be more energy-efficient. That's where we can make real progress, not just punishing the oil companies."

You know, I've had the pleasure of listening to a lot of smart folks outside of this administration who have some very good ideas on how to succeed in Iraq. And I'll tell you one idea that I've found to be particularly intriguing, is the concept of a more robust provincial reconstruction team, as proposed by Ambassador Khalilzad, which would provide more assistance to the provinces of Iraq. That idea, which originated outside of the administration, but was discussed extensively within it, and I think it's a darn good one.\n\nI'm also interested in the ideas that General Casey and General Abizaid have discussed with me about the importance of training Iraqi security forces. Obviously, this is an idea that's had significant discussion within the administration, but also outside of it. It's a fundamental component of our strategy going forward, and I think we can do a better job of getting the word out to the Iraqis that we're committed to training their forces, to helping them stand up, so they can secure their own country.\n\nThese people - and I'm just mentioning a couple - are folks who have good ideas. I'm a guy who likes to listen to good ideas and put them into practice. And whether the idea comes from inside the administration or outside the administration, if it's a good idea that's going to help us achieve our objective, we'll take it."

I'm a strong believer in staying within our means and being fiscally responsible.\n\nI think there are some ideas that have merit. Raising the minimum wage, for example, is an issue that I've always said I'm open to. I've proposed a minimum wage increase in the past, but we need to be careful about unintended consequences, like what happens with the employment of low-skilled workers. We need to find a balance.\n\nOn the other hand, rolling back the tax cuts would be a non-starter. I firmly believe that our tax cuts have helped to stimulate economic growth, and going back on them now would be a mistake. I think we should keep the tax cuts, not just for the wealthy, but for working-class Americans who have benefited from those tax cuts as well.\n\nAnd as for stem cell research, we need to be mindful of the ethical implications of this issue. I support stem cell research, but I also want to make it clear that I believe in the sanctity of human life and the protection of embryos.\n\nSo there are areas where we can work together, but there are also areas where we may disagree. And that's okay. I'm a strong believer in the separation of powers, and I look forward to having a constructive dialogue with the new Speaker and the Democratic leadership on these issues."

And we care about the national security of the United States.\n\nNow, as commander-in-chief, I have a solemn duty to make decisions based on the advice of our military commanders and the experts on the ground. And I'm telling you, we're making progress in Iraq. We're making progress in terms of the security situation. We've made significant gains in Anbar Province, which was once a hotbed of insurgency. We're seeing signs that ordinary Iraqis are turning against the terrorists and the militants, which is a positive sign.\n\nNow, I know some folks want a quick end to this war. I understand that. But as the commander-in-chief, I have to think about the consequences of our actions. I have to think about the consequences of leaving Iraq before the job is done. And I firmly believe that if we leave before the Iraqis can defend themselves and govern themselves, we'll be inviting chaos and instability, and that would be a mistake.\n\nAs for the surge, it's working. It's doing its job. We're seeing results. We're seeing a decrease in sectarian violence. We're seeing an increase in confidence among the Iraqi people. And I'm committed to seeing this through to completion. I'm not putting an artificial deadline on the surge. I'm going to be guided by the best military advice. And I'm confident that we're on the right path.\n\nNow, I understand, and I respect those who have a different view. I respect the fact that Americans are questioning the course of action. But I believe I have a solemn duty to do what I think is right, and that's what I'm doing."

I appreciate the input from Chairman Greenspan and Dr. Feldstein, two highly respected voices in the field.\n\nWhile we've taken steps to support the economy, including the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, we're not out of the woods yet. I agree that we need to do more to prevent further economic downturn. However, I also believe we must be responsible in our approach and make sure that any new measures are targeted, effective, and fiscally sound.\n\nRegarding Chairman Greenspan's suggestion on foreclosure prevention, I think it's worth exploring options that would help homeowners who are struggling to stay in their homes. Perhaps we could consider some form of assistance for mortgage holders, such as temporary relief or refinancing options. However, we must also ensure that any such program is carefully targeted and doesn't create unintended consequences or moral hazard.\n\nAs for Dr. Feldstein's proposal for more tax cuts, I'm open to considering additional tax relief, but we need to make sure it's done in a way that stimulates economic growth and doesn't add to the deficit. We've already passed significant tax cuts in the past, and I believe we should focus on making those permanent, rather than layering on new temporary measures.\n\nUltimately, our approach must be guided by a commitment to fiscal responsibility and a willingness to take a balanced and bipartisan approach. I'm willing to work with Democrats and Republicans alike to find common ground and pass legislation that will help support our economy and get America back on track.\n\nThank you, and I'll take the next question."

However, I want the American people to know we're working hard to create jobs, to stimulate the economy.\n\nAs for the '92 election, I've spoken to my father about it, and I'm aware of the concerns that you've just articulated. My answer is I'm not worried about historical parallels. I'm worried about solving the problems that are at hand. We're working closely with the Fed to keep the economy strong and I think that with the fiscal discipline we've shown, combined with the tax cuts we've implemented, will help the economy grow.\n\nNow, as for Senator McCain, he's a strong candidate with great experience, good instincts on the issues and he'll make his own case to the American people.

We support the Olympic Charter, which promotes peace, unity, and international understanding.\n\nRegarding the freedom of expression for athletes, we believe that the international community should support the rights of athletes to express their views in a peaceful manner.

Getting a lasting peace agreement won't be easy, and it's unlikely to be achieved overnight. But we're committed to staying engaged and working with all parties involved to try to drive this process forward.\n\nRegarding the rise of anti-Semitism in Europe, I must say that this trend is deeply disturbing. The idea of anti-Semitic threats, hate crimes, and rhetoric being directed toward Jewish communities in Europe or anywhere else is absolutely unacceptable. We take it very seriously and we strongly condemn such actions.\n\nAs for whether this concern could spread to the United States, well, while I have faith in the American people, we must always remain vigilant against any form of prejudice, intolerance, and hatred. We have a long history of standing against such evil in our country, and we will continue to work hard to prevent such a spread.\n\nOur Department of Homeland Security and other agencies will certainly be monitoring this issue closely, both domestically and in cooperation with our international partners, to ensure the safety and security of Jewish communities here at home.\n\nWe value the special relationship we have with the Jewish community, not just here in America, but throughout the world.

Our procedures are designed to provide individuals with an opportunity to contest the basis of their detention, and we have taken additional steps to ensure the integrity and legitimacy of these proceedings.\n\nI also want to emphasize that we will conduct these proceedings in a manner that balances our commitment to upholding our values of fairness and due process with the imperative of protecting our national security.

If additional troops are needed to ensure the security of the Iraqi people, I will make that decision, but I want to emphasize that our goal is to transfer the responsibility to the Iraqis as soon as possible.\n\nAs for the deadline for drafting the new constitution, I believe the Iraqi people are dedicated to this process, and we're working closely with them to support their efforts.

We're also fighting a terrorist network, al-Qaeda, that is bent on harming America and our allies.\n\nIn Vietnam, the conflict was more of a Cold War conflict, with the Viet Cong backed by the North Vietnamese, and it was also a much larger conventional force that we were facing.\n\nIn Iraq, we're not only fighting to defeat the enemy, but we're also fighting to help the Iraqi people build a free and democratic society, which is a fundamentally different mission.\n\nAnd in terms of the deployment, our troops are more agile, more mobile, and more technologically advanced. They're not dug in for years; they're going on missions to clear out terrorists, and they're not getting bogged down.\n\nFurthermore, I would say that our goals in Iraq are much clearer. We're working closely with the international community, unlike Vietnam.

One of the most important is the need for a more comprehensive approach \u2013 military, economic, diplomatic, and ideological. We can't just defeat the terrorists on the battlefield; we also have to counter their twisted ideology, encourage freedom and democracy, and address the underlying conditions that extremist groups often exploit.\n\nIn Iraq specifically, we've learned that it's not just a matter of putting more troops on the ground, but also working with the Iraqi government to strengthen their institutions and build a functioning economy. We've learned that brutal tactics like Abu Ghraib can undermine our efforts, and we've taken steps to address these issues.\n\nIn the final two years of my presidency, we'll be guided by these lessons. We'll work closely with the Iraqi government to train and strengthen their military, accelerate economic growth, and build on the progress made in the surge.

We share a 2,000-mile border, and that makes us intertwined in many ways.\n\nI'm not saying that we're going to compromise our relationships with Europe and Canada. Not at all. We're going to maintain those relationships, and we're going to work closely with our allies there. But I do think it's time for us to focus on our own hemisphere and to work on building a more prosperous and stable region.\n\nI think it's a false choice, by the way, to say that we have to choose between our relationships with Mexico and our relationships with Europe and Canada. We can and will do both. We'll work with our allies in Europe and Canada to strengthen our relationships there, while also working to build stronger relationships in our own hemisphere.\n\nI hope our friends in Europe and Canada will see this trip for what it is - an opportunity for us to strengthen our relationships in our own hemisphere and to promote our common interests and values."

I did say that we're committed to addressing the issue of climate change, and we are. We've got a very important commitment to the international community to do just that.\n\nNow, as for the specifics of a package, I recall saying that we would be presenting the details of our approach in February, not at Marrakech. We've got some work to do on it, and we're going to be forthcoming with it. We're going to make sure that our package is one that makes sense for our economy, but also addresses the concerns about greenhouse gases.\n\nAnd I don't recall saying anything that would indicate we'd have a package ready for Marrakech. So I think there's just been a bit of a miscommunication here. But I appreciate the opportunity to clarify it."

Saddam Hussein is a threat to the United States, to the region, and to the world. He's a brutal dictator who has massacre his own people, invaded neighboring countries, and has not lived up to his international obligations, including those related to disarmament. We're working with the international community to find a way to disarm Saddam Hussein, and to hold him accountable for his actions.\n\nRegarding military action, I'm not going to speculate on specific tactics or strategies.

I appreciate the efforts the Pakistani government is making to try to secure his release. We are working closely with the Pakistani government to try to resolve this situation as quickly as possible.\n\nAs for whether Mr. Pearl is alive, I don't have any information that I can share with you. We're making every effort to secure his release, and we're working closely with the Pakistani government to do so. We're doing everything we can to try to bring a peaceful resolution to this situation.\n\nI'll tell you one thing - we're committed to working with President Musharraf, and we appreciate his cooperation in the war on terror. He's been a strong partner in this effort, and we appreciate his efforts to help resolve the situation with Daniel Pearl."

We both agree that terrorism is a threat to the safety and security of our citizens, and we're committed to working together to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks.\n\nWe discussed a range of initiatives to enhance our cooperation on counter-terrorism, including intelligence sharing, law enforcement cooperation, and efforts to cut off terrorist financing. We also talked about the importance of promoting moderate voices and countering extremist ideology.\n\nEgypt, under President Mubarak's leadership, has been a strong partner in the war on terror, and I want to thank him for his country's contributions to the global effort. We look forward to continuing our close cooperation and working together to make the world a safer and more secure place.\n\nAnd I'd like to add that our talks were not limited to counter-terrorism, we also discussed other important regional issues, such as Middle East peace process and the situation in the region.

The reason we're prioritizing emergency and healthcare workers is that they're the ones on the front lines, they're the ones who would be most likely to be exposed to smallpox in the event of an outbreak. We gotta protect those who would be most at risk.\n\nNow, I understand that some folks might want to get vaccinated, and I appreciate that. But we gotta make sure that we're not creating unnecessary demand, not creating a false sense of security. You see, the smallpox vaccine is not without risks. There are side effects, and we don't want to needlessly expose people to those risks.\n\nWe're taking a cautious approach, working with the CDC and other experts to make sure that we're making the right decisions for the American people. We'll continue to monitor the situation, and we'll adjust our approach as needed.\n\nBut I gotta tell you, I've got confidence in the plan we've got in place.

First of all, let me assure the American people that our foreign policy is based on principles of freedom, justice, and peace. And we're committed to working with all nations, regardless of their faith, to achieve those goals.\n\nNow, I don't agree with the notion that our foreign policy is biased. I think it's quite the opposite. We're a nation that values freedom, and we're willing to work with those who share our values. The United States has a long-standing commitment to the security of Israel, but that doesn't mean we're not committed to the security and prosperity of other nations in the region.\n\nIt's also important for the world to understand that we value the relationships with Muslim-majority countries. We're working closely with them on a variety of issues, from counterterrorism to education and trade.\n\nNow, I do acknowledge that there's a perception out there that we don't get it, that we don't understand Islam. But I can assure you, we do get it. We understand the importance of faith, and we understand the importance of working with faith leaders. That's why I've taken the initiative to meet with Muslim leaders, here and abroad, to discuss the importance of peace, the importance of fighting terror, and the importance of working together to achieve our goals.\n\nWe also understand that there are those who would seek to use our actions or our policies as a means to recruit and radicalize. And we're working to counter those forces. We're working to show the world that the United States values peace, values justice, and values the life of every citizen, regardless of their faith.\n\nIn the end, I believe our foreign policy is guided by a strong moral compass, a commitment to freedom, and a commitment to working with nations to achieve those goals."

Our decision was based solely on removing a threat to the United States, freeing the Iraqi people from the grip of tyranny, and making this world a safer place.\n\nNow, regarding the issue of oil, I think it's interesting to hear some of our critics suggest that we should be asking for Iraq's oil in exchange for our help. Let me be clear: the Iraqi people own their oil, and it's up to them to decide how to use it. We're focused on helping the Iraqi people rebuild their country, and we're doing so in a way that's transparent and accountable.\n\nWe do believe, however, that Iraq's oil revenues should be used to benefit the Iraqi people, not just a privileged few. And we're working with the Iraqi government and the international community to ensure that those revenues are used in a responsible way.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I don't find it frustrating. I think it's just another example of the shifting sands of criticism. Our critics were wrong when they said we went to war for oil, and now they're wrong when they say we should be taking Iraq's oil as repayment. Our focus has always been on doing what's right, and that's what we'll continue to do."

In fact, our approach has always been multifaceted.\n\nWe've had tax relief, but we've also invested in education, in healthcare, and in infrastructure. And so, what I'd say is that we'll be evaluating the economic situation and the needs of the country, and we'll make decisions based on that. While I don't rule out any option, including additional tax relief, I also want to make it very clear that our progrowth agenda will also focus on other areas, as I've mentioned.\n\nWe are considering all the tools available to us to promote economic growth, and we'll be watching the economy carefully to make sure that we're taking the right steps to keep it strong and growing. We want to make sure that the American people have the tools and the environment they need to be successful.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, I wouldn't rule out further tax cuts, but I also don't want to give the impression that that's all we're going to focus on.

However, I do not have any reservations about our mission in Iraq.

And I think it's essential that we all work together to see that ... that that doesn't become a barrier to the development of a Palestinian state that's contiguous.\n\nAnd, Mr. President Mubarak, you asked about Egypt's role.

Additionally, we're providing technical assistance to help the Iraqi government build its capacity to manage and implement projects effectively.\n\nNow, I know that unemployment is a significant challenge in Iraq, and we're committed to helping the government address this issue. We believe that by investing in Iraq's infrastructure, supporting the growth of the private sector, and promoting economic reforms, we can create jobs and opportunities for the Iraqi people.\n\nI want to assure the Iraqi people that we're committed to their country's future, and we're working diligently to ensure that the international community's contributions are used effectively and efficiently to benefit the Iraqi people.

And as I said earlier, our Army and our coalition forces are making good progress in helping the Iraqis stand up and take control of their own security.\n\nNow, I've always said that our troop levels will be conditions-based, not time-based. In other words, we'll withdraw our troops when the Iraqis can handle their own security. We've got a plan to transition responsibility to the Iraqis, and as they're able to take more and more responsibility, we'll be able to reduce our troop levels.\n\nNow, I'm not going to give the Iraqis a specific timetable. That would defeat the purpose of being conditions-based. I mean, you can't give a terrorist a timetable for when you're leaving, and expect them to just go ahead with their plans. That doesn't make any sense. We're constantly evaluating the situation on the ground, and working with the Iraqis to make sure they're able to take control of their own security.

As you know, I vetoed the SCHIP bill because it increased spending by too much and expanded the program beyond its original intent. Now, I agree that children's health care is a top priority, but we've got to be fiscally responsible in how we approach this issue.\n\nAs for working together, I believe I acted in good faith. I proposed a more modest expansion of SCHIP, one that would have increased funding by $5 billion over five years. Unfortunately, the Democratic-led Congress chose to go a different route and passed a bill that went too far. I made it clear that I would veto this version of the bill, and they chose to push it to a vote anyway.\n\nI think part of the problem here is a philosophical difference. We have a disagreement about the role of government in providing health care. I believe in a limited government that works with the private sector to provide health care solutions. The Democrats, it seems, want to take the federal government in a direction that I think would be costly and create a new entitlement program that we can't afford.\n\nI'm willing to work with Congress to find common ground on this issue. In fact, I've invited leaders from both parties to the White House to discuss a way forward.

We need to have the capability to respond to these threats in a way that's effective and proportional.\n\nBut let me be clear: we're not going to rush into anything. We're going to take a thoughtful and deliberate approach to this question. We'll be consulting with our allies, with the international community, and with the experts to ensure that we're making the right decision.\n\nAnd I want to emphasize that our first priority remains the same: to prevent proliferation, to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. We're committed to non-proliferation, and we'll work tirelessly to ensure that these weapons don't fall into the wrong hands.\n\nSo, in short, we're thinking about the development of low-yield nuclear weapons as one tool in our toolkit to counter the unconventional threats we face. It's a serious consideration, and we'll approach it in a careful and deliberate way."

    "gen_response": "Well, Bob, first of all, let me clarify that the situation in Iraq and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, while connected to the Middle East, are distinct and separate issues. I believe that Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq is a threat to America's national security, to the stability of the region, and to the world at large.\n\nVice President Cheney, Secretary Powell, and other members of my administration are working diligently to communicate our concerns about Iraq's WMD programs and Saddam Hussein's defiant behavior to our Arab allies and other nations. We're building a strong case to hold Saddam Hussein accountable for his actions, and to encourage support for his disarmament or regime change.\n\nNow, regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I'm deeply troubled by the recent increase in violence. We're working to bring the parties together to find a peaceful resolution to their differences. We believe that a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will require leadership from both sides and a willingness to make difficult choices. Ultimately, our goal is to see the emergence of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace.\n\nHowever, I must emphasize that the situation in Iraq is not directly linked to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Saddam Hussein's pursuit of WMD and his refusal to comply with UN resolutions pose a unique threat that requires a separate response. We will continue to work with our Arab allies and other nations to address both of these critical challenges in the region."

I think it's essential to understand the complexity of this situation. Saddam Hussein is a threat, not just to the United States, but to the entire world. He's a man who has shown a reckless disregard for human life, for international law, and for the stability of the region.\n\nNow, regarding the specific question of whether or not he would become more aggressive if we were to take military action... (pauses again) I'd say that's impossible to predict with certainty. But one thing's for sure: Saddam's got a record of miscalculation, and that's what makes him so unpredictable.\n\nHowever, we cannot afford to let fear of what he might do dictate our actions. We must look at the facts, and the fact is that Saddam's got these terrible weapons, and he's demonstrated the willingness to use them. (firmly) We will not wait for him to make a move that could potentially harm our citizens or destabilize the region.\n\nAs Commander-in-Chief, I will do what is necessary to protect this great nation, its people, and our interests. Thank you. ( gestures to the next reporter)"

Now, with Saddam in custody, we're optimistic that some of the command structure, if you will, that was directin' these attacks will begin to fall apart.\n\nNow, I want to caution the American people that there are still those in Iraq who want to do us harm, who want to disrupt the progress we're makin' towards stability and security in that country. In the short term, I don't think it's wise to assume that the violence will suddenly end. But in the long term, I'm confident that with the capture of Saddam Hussein and the continue efforts of the coalition, we will see a reduction in the level of violence and a increase in the stability of that country.\n\nMake no mistake, we're makin' progress in Iraq, and this is a significant step forward. But we're not gonna let our guard down. We're gonna continue to work with the Iraqi people, continue to work with the international community, to bring peace and stability to that region.

I can tell you that we worked very closely with Ambassador Brahimi to ensure that this government is representative of the Iraqi people. We engaged in a thorough and inclusive process that brought together leaders from various backgrounds and regions.\n\nNow, I'm not gonna sit here and tell you that it's gonna be easy. I mean, we're dealing with a country that's been devastated by decades of tyranny and malaise. We're dealing with factions that have had no history of working together, with no tradition of democracy.

As for what needs to happen before the United States would sign on to such a conference, I'd like to see some tangible steps taken towards creating a more constructive and conducive environment for dialogue.\n\nFirst, we need to see a significant reduction in violence and terrorism from Palestinian groups. We need to see a real commitment to dismantling terrorist infrastructure and a focus on peaceful negotiations, not violence. We also need to see Israel taking steps to support the Palestinian economy and improve the humanitarian situation on the ground.\n\nFurthermore, any conference would need to be grounded in a clear set of goals and principles, such as the two-state solution and the principles outlined in the Roadmap. We need to see all parties, including the Palestinians, Israelis, and Arab states, genuinely committed to making progress and moving towards a lasting peace.\n\nRegarding the naming of a U.S. envoy, we're actively considering various names and options. We'll need someone who has the credibility, expertise, and the ability to get the parties to the table and help them focus on achieving concrete results.\n\nAs for this upcoming trip to Europe, I'm looking forward to meeting with our allies and partners to discuss a range of critical issues, including the Middle East peace process, global terrorism, and economic cooperation. We'll be working to strengthen our partnerships, find ways to increase international cooperation, and advance our shared values of democracy, freedom, and human rights.\n\nIn particular, I'm looking forward to meeting with Prime Minister Blair and other European leaders to discuss the Middle East, as well as the situation in Afghanistan and Iraq.

First, let me clarify that my administration's commitment to supporting the people affected by natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, remains unwavering. In terms of federal involvement and troops, I believe it's essential for the federal government to have the necessary authority and resources to respond to catastrophic events. What I was referring to last night is the potential for the federal government to take a more proactive role in providing support and assistance in the aftermath of a disaster.\n\nNow, as it relates to the specifics of troop deployments or federalizing the National Guard, those are decisions that we'll make on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the unique circumstances of each situation. Our goal is to ensure that we're providing the necessary support to the affected communities and that we're not overstepping our bounds.\n\nRegarding my conversation with President Putin, I had a very productive discussion with him on the issue of Iran's nuclear program. I believe it's essential for the international community to work together to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. I made it clear to President Putin that the United States believes Iran's actions pose a significant threat to global security and stability, and that we must take a strong stance against their pursuit of nuclear capabilities.\n\nAs for sending the issue to the Security Council, I think there's a growing international consensus that this issue needs to be addressed, and the United Nations is the appropriate forum to do so. I'm heartened by the conversations I've had with President Putin and other world leaders who share our concerns about Iran's actions, and I believe we're making progress towards presenting a united front on this issue."

We've made significant progress since then. The federal, state, and local governments have worked together to provide critical aid, including food, water, shelter, and medical care to those in need.\n\nHowever, I understand that there's still much work to be done.

What we're seeing is an escalation of sectarian violence, certainly, and it's unfortunate. But I believe we need to be careful with the terminology we use.\n\nCivil war connotes a situation where the government has lost control and is pitted against its people. What we see in Iraq is a government that is struggling to exert its authority, with extremism and terrorism trying to tear the country apart.\n\nNow, that's not to say the situation isn't serious - it is. We've seen the implication of sectarian violence, and it's a major challenge to the new Iraqi government. But I think we should avoid, you know, reflexively falling into the characterization of a civil war. We need to be mindful of the fact that Iraq has made significant progress, there are elections coming up, and the Iraqi people are trying to rebuild their country.\n\nThe key here is, will the Iraqi people and their government be able to confront this problem, with our help and with the help of the international community?

But what we are trying to do is help the Iraqis create a condition where the Iraqi security forces are capable of taking control, where the government is strong enough to make the necessary decisions, and where the Iraqi people have confidence in their government.\n\nNow, as for the reduction in violence, I believe we are making progress. We've seen a significant decrease in sectarian violence, for example. But what we need to see is a commitment from all parties to work towards a peaceful solution, to reconcile their differences, and to rebuild their country.\n\nIn terms of drawing down our troops, I've said that our goal is to get to the point where we can start to reduce our force size. But we need to be careful not to do it too quickly, because we want to make sure that we're leaving behind a stability that will be sustainable.\n\nNow, as for the exact figure, that's something that General Petraeus and our military commanders will be working on, in consultation with the Iraqi government, to determine what's the right pace and the right size of our drawdown. But I will say that we are making progress, and we're optimistic that we can get to the point where we can start to reduce our force size in the not-too-distant future."

It's a process that's been underway, and I'm encouraged by the progress that's been made so far. I do not think that allowing insurgents who have killed Americans, Italians, and for that matter, a lot of Iraqis to get amnesty. You cannot allow killers to be granted amnesty. Accountability is important. And I understand that a lot of the Iraqis will work to grant immunity to those and amnesties to Iraqis who fought against the coalition forces because we are fighting against the tyranny. As for the second part of your question regarding the Iraqi oil, we believe the Iraq's oil revenues belong to the Iraqis people.

It's a tough fight, and we've faced some setbacks. But I think it's essential to remember that we're not just fighting for Iraq; we're fighting for a more secure America, and we're fighting for the cause of freedom.\n\nAs for support, I believe that the American people understand the importance of this mission. They know that we're not just fighting for a specific country; we're fighting for the principles of democracy and liberty. And I believe that the vast majority of the American people support our efforts.\n\nOf course, I recognize that there are some who disagree with my decisions, and that's okay. That's a part of the democratic process. But let me tell you, I'm not going to make decisions based on popular opinion or public polls.

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question. The situation in Iraq is, indeed, a very serious and complex one. I understand why some people might be tempted to call it a civil war, but I don't think that's entirely accurate.\n\nWhat we're seeing in Iraq is a mix of sectarian violence and a terrorist campaign led by al-Qaeda and other extremist groups, as well as some insurgents who oppose the Iraqi government. Now, it's true that there are Sunni and Shia factions involved, and that's why some people might see parallels with a civil war.\n\nHowever, I don't think that fully captures the nature of the problem we're facing. You see, the vast majority of Iraqis, both Sunni and Shia, want to live in peace and stability. They want a unified Iraq, free from the grip of terrorism and extremism.\n\nWhat's driving the violence is a relatively small group of radical Islamists, who have chosen to target innocent civilians, by the way, regardless of their sect or creed. These are the very same folks who would like to drive us out of Iraq, and embolden the broader extremist movement across the region.\n\nIf you call it a civil war, it could indeed give some folks, not in this administration, but critics, the impression that it's somehow acceptable, or mainly an internal Iraqi issue. But the truth is, the stakes are much higher than that.\n\nThe consequences of failure are regional, if not global. It would be an existential threat, if a chaotic, failed state in Iraq becomes a safe haven for these terrorist groups. That would not just affect the region, that would affect America."

I've always said that it's okay to disagree with me, and I think it's okay to agree or disagree with the decision to go into Iraq.\n\nWhat I do think is important is to support our troops, to give them the equipment they need, to give 'em the funding they need to do their job, and to make sure their families are taken care of. And I think it's also important to recognize that these men and women are volunteering to serve our country, and that they're making sacrifices on behalf of our country.\n\nNow, I do think that when you're in a time of war, and we are at war, that there's a time for debate, and there's a time for decision-making. And I've made the decision to go into Iraq, based on the intelligence I had, and based on the idea that we needed to take a different approach to Saddam Hussein.\n\nBut I think it's perfectly legitimate for people to express their opinions, to express their disagreement, and to say, you know, \"I think you made a mistake, Mr. President.\" I mean, that's just part of the democratic process.\n\nWhat I don't think is helpful is when people resort to personal attacks, or when people criticize our troops. That's not supportin' the troops. Supportin' the troops is, as I said, givin' 'em the equipment they need, the funding they need, and takin' care of their families.\n\nSo, I think there's a line there, between constructive criticism and support for our troops, and then the kind of criticism that, in my view, is not particularly helpful."

We're also going to promote private sector growth, which will help us meet our goal of cutting the deficit in half by the year 2009.\n\nNow, I know some folks in Washington will say, \"Well, the President needs to have a specific plan that raises taxes or cuts entitlements.\" I'm not going to adhere to a specific litmus test on how to reduce the deficit, other than to say we've got a comprehensive plan to do so.\n\nAnd I'm confident it's going to work. I'm confident because I understand that the best way to deal with the deficit is to make sure our economy's growing, is to make sure we're entrepreneurial, and making sure that the private sector is healthy.\n\nSo, we've got a plan. We've presented it to the Congress. We're working closely with the Congress to see that it passes. I'm optimistic that we can make some progress on reducing the deficit. And I'm not worried, by the way, about the weakening dollar. The fundamentals of our economy are sound, and I'm confident in the future of America's economy. Next question, please."

We've had some tough moments as a country.

We're making progress, and we're winning battles. But we're also facing an enemy that's adaptable, resilient, and determined.\n\nNow, I understand that the numbers may not reflect that progress, at least not immediately. But let me tell you, we've made significant strides in dismantling the al-Qaeda network, taking out key leaders, and disrupting their financing and communication channels.\n\nHowever, this enemy has also changed tactics. They've become more decentralized, they're using more unconventional methods, and they're targeting softer targets. They're trying to create a sense of chaos and fear, and they're trying to undermine our will.\n\nBut let me be clear: we're not going to be intimidated, we're not going to be deterred, and we're not going to back down. We're going to keep pushing forward, we're going to keep going after them, and we're going to keep working with our allies to dismantle these terrorist networks.\n\nNow, I know that the numbers may not be what we want them to be right now, but I can tell you that we're making progress. And I'm convinced that with the brave men and women of our military, with the help of our allies, and with the resilience of the American people, we're going to win this war on terrorism.\n\nAnd one more thing: we're not going to let the terrorists dictate the agenda. We're going to stay on offense, we're going to stay proactive, and we're going to stay committed to spreading freedom and democracy to those who are willing to stand up and fight for it.\n\nThank you for your question. Next question, please."

This legislation is making a real difference in the lives of many young Americans. It's helping to ensure that every child, regardless of their background or zip code, has access to a quality education.\n\nRegarding the funding concerns expressed by the teachers union, I want to assure the American people that we are fully committed to supporting our nation's schools and teachers. While we may have differences of opinion on the amount of funding, I believe that we've made significant strides in increasing federal support for our nation's education system.\n\nUnder No Child Left Behind, we've increased federal funding for K-12 education by nearly 40% since 2001. This is a significant investment in our nation's future, and it's helping to support important initiatives like teacher quality, educational technology, and targeted support for disadvantaged students.\n\nNow, I understand that some may argue that more funding is needed, and I respect that perspective. However, I also believe that we must be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars and ensure that funding is being used effectively. We're working closely with states, school districts, and educators to identify areas where we can better support their efforts to improve student achievement.\n\nAs for whether No Child Left Behind is working, I firmly believe that it is. We're seeing early signs of progress, particularly in reading and math scores. In addition, we're making strides in closing the achievement gap that has long plagued our education system. These gains are promising, but I'm also committed to continuing to work with educators, policymakers, and other stakeholders to build on this momentum and make necessary adjustments to ensure the law is working as intended.\n\nWe will continue to work with the teaching profession and all stakeholders to ensure that every child has access to a quality education, and we will keep pushing to make sure that No Child Left Behind is a success for every child in America."

As President, I believe that one of my key responsibilities is to ensure the federal judiciary is staffed with highly qualified, fair-minded, and impartial judges who will uphold the Constitution. And I firmly believe that my judicial nominees meet those high standards.\n\nNow, I understand that the Senate has a vital role to play in the confirmation process, and I respect that institution. But I also expect the Senate to give these nominees a fair up-or-down vote, without unnecessary delays or obstruction.\n\nRegarding the notion that Republicans did the same thing during President Clinton's administration, I'd say that the situation is quite different. During the Clinton era, many of his nominees received a vote on the Senate floor, even if they didn't get confirmed. We've had multiple instances now where nominees have been blocked from even getting a confirmation hearing, let alone a vote on the floor.\n\nAs for the impact on my domestic agenda, I believe that these judicial confirmations are an integral part of that agenda. We need judges who will respect the laws passed by Congress and uphold the principles of federalism. If the Senate fails to move forward on these nominees, it will hinder our ability to govern effectively.\n\nSo, I urge the Senate to focus on the qualifications and fitness of these nominees, rather than resorting to procedural roadblocks. We need to work together to ensure the federal judiciary is the best it can be, and I'm willing to have that discussion and work with the Senate to get there. Thank you."

But it's another thing to deny funding for our troops to get what they need to succeed. And that's what the Democrats have done. They've voted to deny funding for the troops. And that's a fact.\n\nNow, I know there's concerns about the war. I share those concerns. I want our troops to come home as soon as possible.

Our goal is to complete the mission, to help the Iraqi people build a stable democracy, and to ensure that Iraq becomes a partner in the war on terror."

    "gen_response": "Well, thank you for that question. I've made it clear that I support comprehensive immigration reform, and a guest-worker program is a vital part of that. I believe that such a program would not only help our economy but also help us better secure our borders. It would provide a way for people who are already here, who are working hard and playing by the rules, to come out of the shadows and join the system.\n\nNow, as for whether or not I would veto a bill that didn't include such a program, I'd have to take a close look at the overall bill. But I will tell you this: I've made it clear to the Congress that I expect a comprehensive approach to this issue. A guest-worker program is an important part of that comprehensive approach. And so, it's difficult for me to imagine supporting a bill that didn't have such a provision.\n\nAs for the concerns from some of my fellow Republicans, I understand their concerns, and I respect their opinions. But I also believe that this is an issue that requires a comprehensive solution. We can't just focus on one aspect of the problem; we've got to solve the whole problem. And that's exactly what this guest-worker program would help us do.\n\nNow, I've spoken to my fellow Republicans, and I've told them that I believe this is an issue that's not only important for our economy but also important for our party. We need to show the American people that we're willing to take on tough issues and solve them in a way that's fair and just.\n\nSo, while I understand the concerns, I'm confident that, in the end, we'll be able to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill that includes a guest-worker program, and it will be good for our economy, good for our country, and good for the Republican Party."

I believe that FEMA plays a vital role in our nation's response to disasters, and we're working hard to make sure that agency is functioning effectively.\n\nRegarding the lessons of Katrina, I want to assure the American people that we have learned from that terrible tragedy. We've been working diligently to improve our response capabilities, and I'm confident that we're better prepared today than we were just a year ago.\n\nWe've taken steps to strengthen FEMA's leadership, to improve our emergency planning and preparedness, and to ensure that our first responders have the resources they need to do their jobs effectively. We've also worked to improve our communications with state and local officials, so we can respond more quickly and effectively in the event of a disaster.\n\nNow, I know that we're not perfect, and we can always do better. But I'm confident that we've made significant progress, and we'll continue to work hard to make sure that we're prepared for any disaster that may come our way.\n\nAnd let me just say, with hurricane season approaching, we're taking all necessary precautions. We're monitoring the situation closely, and we're working with state and local officials to make sure that they're prepared to respond quickly and effectively. We'll do everything in our power to protect the American people and to minimize the impact of any disaster that may occur.\n\nSo, I want to assure the American people that we've learned from the lessons of Katrina, and we're working hard to make sure that we're prepared for whatever challenges may come our way."

We've been working closely with our allies, including our fellow permanent members of the UN Security Council, to find a way forward.\n\nAs for the current state of negotiations, I would say that we're not there yet. The Iranians have yet to accept the package that we've proposed, which includes a variety of incentives, including economic and energy cooperation, as well as security guarantees. But I remain hopeful that, with continued diplomatic effort, we can find a way forward that addresses the concerns of all parties involved.\n\nAs for what Iran stands to gain, it's quite clear: if Iran were to agree to verifiably suspend its enrichment program and cooperate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency, it would be able to enjoy the benefits of international cooperation, including access to civilian nuclear technology and integration into the world community. And I think that's a pretty attractive prospect.\n\nNow, regarding these recent back-channel overtures from Iran, I can assure you that we take all communications from the Iranians seriously, and we're always willing to listen to proposals that could lead to a peaceful resolution of this issue. However, we also need to be clear-eyed about the Iranian government's history of broken promises and duplicity.\n\nWe can't just take the Iranians' word for it; we need to see concrete actions that back up their words. And until that happens, we'll continue to work with our allies to apply pressure on the Iranian government to cooperate.\n\nAnd let me just say one more thing: the United States will not be deterred from pursuing our goal of achieving a diplomatic solution to this issue. We're committed to working with the international community to find a way forward that addresses the concerns of all parties involved, and we'll continue to pursue that effort until we succeed. Thank you. Next question, please."

I understand their desire to see progress in Iraq, and to see American troops come home. We all share that hope. However, we cannot allow our decisions to be driven solely by public opinion or timetables; we must make decisions based on what is in the best interest of our national security.\n\nI've received advice from General Petraeus and other military leaders on the ground in Iraq. I'm committed to working with Congress to develop a bipartisan strategy for Iraq that is flexible, that adjusts to changing circumstances, and that gets the job done.\n\nI'm fully aware that there is skepticism and even cynicism among some Americans about the war. I understand those feelings, but I believe the mission is crucial to the security of our nation and to the stability of the region.

But we also expect them to understand the gravity of this situation and the threat that a nuclear-armed Iran poses to global security.\n\nOne approach we're considering is targeting specific sectors of the Iranian economy that are more directly linked to their nuclear program, such as the banking and energy sectors. This would help minimize the impact on our allies while still putting pressure on the regime.\n\nWe'll also engage in close diplomatic efforts with our allies to find ways to mitigate any negative effects on their economies. We're all in this together, and we'll work to ensure that we're sharing the burden fairly.\n\nBut let me be clear: the Iranian regime must understand that their pursuit of nuclear capabilities will not be tolerated.

And, you know, the executive branch and the legislative branch will work together to come up with solutions that are reasonable and wise.\n\nNow, as you know, I've been clear on my position on climate change. I believe it's a significant issue, a global issue. And as a matter of fact, the United States has been a leader in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nRegarding caps, I think it's essential that we be careful and thoughtful before we impose what could be considered a rather significant tax. I believe there's a better way, and that's through the use of technology and encouraging new practices that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nI'm also concerned about the economic implications of broad caps on greenhouse gas emissions, and the potential impact on the American economy and, most importantly, the American people.\n\nSo, I think the Court's decision is significant, but it doesn't necessarily mean we must impose caps.

We'll be providing them with information about the system, about its capabilities, and about our intentions.

    "gen_response": "Well, I appreciate the question. I want to start by saying that the incident involving Blackwater was, first and foremost, a tragic loss of life. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who were killed. \n\nWith regard to the relationship with Prime Minister Maliki, we are working closely to resolve this matter. We have a significant stake in the success of Iraq, and we have a very good relationship with the Prime Minister and the Iraqi Government. The Prime Minister did express concerns and frustration, which I understand, in the wake of this incident. Our Ambassador, Ryan Crocker, has been in close touch with the Iraqi government, working to understand the facts of this incident.\n\nNow regarding Blackwater and other private security companies, I think it's worth noting that these firms have a critical role to play in securing not just US diplomats and US Embassy personnel, but also other coalition forces and contractors who are helping the Iraqi people rebuild their country. There have been circumstances in which the Iraqi Government has, indeed, requested their assistance.\n\nIn terms of accountability \u2013 and I believe this is where you're heading \u2013 it's true that under the Coalition Provisional Authority Order 17, private security contractors do have immunity from Iraqi law. However, this is a complicated issue, and I have spoken to Secretary Rice and Secretary Gates about it. We need to make sure that our contractors are held to high standards, but also, that we ensure that they are able to carry out their duties safely and effectively.\n\nIt's worth noting, however, that these contractors are not above the law. They are subject to US law and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. We are investigating this incident, and if there is wrongdoing, there will be accountability. And I have confidence that the investigation will be thorough and complete.\n\nNow, this incident, in my view, serves as a wake-up call that it's time to start passing laws and deciding what is the best way to handle private security contractors in a theater of operation, be they State Department contractors or Defense contractors. And, as you know, I have asked Secretary Gates and Secretary Rice to review the precisely-balanced laws \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 governing security contractors, so that there is a clearer understanding of what rules and regulations apply.\n\nWe need to balance the needs of security with our commitment to the rule of law and Iraq's sovereignty."

We're talking about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the issue of statehood, economic development, and the issue of political reform in the region.\n\nIn terms of what we are offering to Arab nations, we want to encourage them to participate because it's in their interest to do so. We believe that a peaceful resolution to these issues will bring greater stability and prosperity to the region. We're talking about a commitment to economic development, to investment in the Palestinian territories, to support for reform efforts in countries like Egypt and Jordan.\n\nAnd we're saying to the Arab countries, \"You've got a stake in this, too.\" If we can resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, if we can begin to address the issue of statehood, it will create a more stable and prosperous region, which will be beneficial to all countries in the region.\n\nWe're not looking for any specific concessions from Arab nations. We're not looking for them to do anything that's not in their interests. We're looking for them to exercise their influence, their leadership, to encourage all parties to come to the table and begin to make progress.\n\nSo, it's a win-win situation. If we can make progress, everyone benefits. And I'm optimistic that we can make some progress, and that's what I mean by saying substantial issues will be discussed. We're not going to be sitting around the table twiddling our thumbs; we're going to be rolling up our sleeves, working hard to begin to address these difficult issues."

The situation on the ground in Afghanistan is difficult. The Taliban is a determined enemy, and they're not giving up without a fight. But I'm confident that with the bravery and skill of our men and women in uniform, we can succeed.\n\nNow, as for the consequences, if those pledges fall short, I think it's safe to say that we'll have to take a hard look at our strategy.

I'm optimistic that our allies will step up, because I believe that this is a critical mission for our common security.\n\nLet me just say, I believe that freedom is the ultimate goal for the people of Afghanistan.

In Afghanistan, we had a very clear enemy in the Taliban, and the Afghan people, by and large, were eager to see them go. They'd had enough of their tyranny, their brutality, and their efforts to keep the country in the Stone Age. So, when we worked with the Northern Alliance and other freedom fighters to take out the Taliban, we had a pretty receptive audience.\n\nIn Iraq, the situation's a little more complicated. Saddam Hussein's reign of terror was more, shall we say, entrenched. He'd been there for a long time, and he'd set up a complex network of informants and enforcers to keep the population in line. Plus, you've got some deep-seated sectarian differences in Iraq that we didn't have to deal with in Afghanistan.\n\nNow, that being said, I will tell you that we're making progress in Iraq.

As I've said before, we must take a comprehensive approach to reforming our entitlement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These programs are vital to our seniors and most vulnerable citizens, but they also drive a significant portion of our federal spending.\n\nTo address this, I propose that we introduce market-based reforms that bring more competition and efficiency to these programs. For example, we can give seniors more choices and options for their healthcare, which would help drive down costs and improve quality.\n\nAdditionally, I'm committed to finding ways to streamline our federal bureaucracy, eliminating waste and duplication, and ensuring that our government agencies are focused on their core functions. We've made some progress in this area already, but there's more work to be done.\n\nFinally, I believe that we must take a closer look at the tax code. Our tax system is too complex, and it's creating unnecessary burdens on our small businesses and working families.

These are not just ordinary individuals we're dealing with \u2013 these are people who want to kill Americans, and we need to take action to stop them.\n\nAs for the second part of your question, I think it's a bit of a hypothetical situation, but I'll answer it anyway. If foreign agents were to come into our country and take an American citizen without going through the proper diplomatic channels, that would be unacceptable. We expect other nations to respect our sovereignty, just as we respect theirs.\n\nHowever, let me be clear: I'm not going to discuss the specifics of our methods or the specifics of our counterterrorism operations. We've got to be careful about what we say in public, because we don't want to give our enemies information that they can use against us.\n\nBut I will say this: we're a nation that's committed to upholding the law and respecting human rights. We've got a system of checks and balances in place to ensure that our intelligence agencies are operating within the bounds of the law. And I'm confident that our agents are acting in a way that's consistent with American values."

What we are proposing is a set of tools and techniques that can help us interrogate and detain high-value targets, those who pose a significant threat to our national security.\n\nNow, I understand that some of these techniques may push the bounds of what we consider acceptable treatment. But I want to assure the American people that we will always adhere to the principles of the Geneva Conventions, and that we will always treat detainees with dignity and respect.\n\nRegarding Senator McCain's concerns, I have a great deal of respect for him and his service to this country. He is a war hero, and his opinions matter to me. However, I believe that our proposal is carefully crafted to ensure that it does not put our troops at risk. In fact, our intelligence experts tell me that the techniques we are proposing will actually help us gain more reliable intelligence, which will help keep our troops safer in the field.\n\nLook, I understand that this is a contentious issue. But I believe that we need to give our law enforcement and intelligence agencies the tools they need to keep America safe. And I am willing to work with Congress to make sure that we get this right, that we find the right balance between security and civil liberties."

Now, that doesn't mean we agree on everything, and we certainly don't.\n\nWhat we're seeing now is that Russia is trying to reassert its influence on the world stage, and that's led to some disagreements. But I still believe that we can have a constructive relationship with Russia, and I think it's essential that we do. However, we can't just sit by and let our concerns about their actions go unaddressed. We're gonna keep talking, keep trying to find common ground, but at the same time, we're gonna stand up for what we believe in, especially when it comes to security and democracy.\n\nAs for whether Putin has changed, I think it's fair to say that his tactics have become more assertive, but that doesn't mean our values and principles have to change. We'll keep reaching out, keep engaging, but also keep holding firm on the things that matter most to us.\n\nLet me make one thing clear: our commitment to freedom, to democracy, and to the security of our allies remains strong. And we're gonna continue to work with Russia where we can, but we'll also stand up to them when we have to. That's the American way."

What we were looking for in these U.S. attorneys was people who would carry out the policies of the administration. Loyalty, in this context, means loyalty to the Constitution and to the laws of the land.\n\nNow, I believe that the attorney general and I have the authority to make the decisions we made. The U.S. attorneys serve at the pleasure of the President. We have the right to evaluate their performance based on an array of factors, including whether or not they're carrying out the laws of the land, whether or not they're supporting our policies.\n\nI must say, however, that I'm a little frustrated with this notion that somehow there was a litmus test for loyalty to me personally. I say that's not true. The American people expect their U.S. attorneys to enforce the law, to do their job in a way that is consistent with the values of our great country. And that's what we expected.\n\nAnd I also want to remind you that we've also found that there's been a lot of misinformation and speculation about this whole issue. We're happy to work with Congress to get to the bottom of this. We're happy to provide documents. But I just want to assure the American people that the decisions we made were based on a careful evaluation of who's best suited to carry out the duties of the U.S. attorney's office.\n\nWe've also got to get this into perspective. This is a normal part of the transition of a Presendency. U.S. attorneys are changed. It's not unusual for an administration to replace U.S. attorneys.

But I also believe that the fundamentals of our economy are strong. We've got low unemployment, low inflation, and we've got a strong labor market.\n\nNow, I know that the housing market is an important part of our economy, and I think the decline in housing starts is a cause for concern. But I also believe that we're taking steps to address the issue. We've already passed the Economic Stimulus Act, which provides tax incentives for housing and for small businesses. We've also taken steps to improve the availability of affordable mortgages.\n\nI think it's also worth noting that the Federal Reserve is keeping a close eye on the economy, and they're taking steps to ensure that the economy remains strong. I have confidence in Chairman Bernanke and his team at the Fed.\n\nIn terms of what more we can do, I think we need to continue to focus on the fundamentals. We need to keep our economy competitive, we need to keep our tax rates low, and we need to keep promoting job creation.\n\nI'm also open to considering additional steps to address the housing market, but I think we need to be careful not to overreact. We don't want to stimulate the housing market in a way that would lead to artificial inflation or other unintended consequences.\n\nOverall, I'm concerned, but I'm not panicked. I think we're taking the right steps, and I'm confident that our economy will continue to grow and thrive.\n\nAnd I'll just say one more thing. This is a global economy, and we're not immune to events beyond our borders. But I think we've got the right mix of policies in place to keep our economy strong, even in the face of global challenges."

And I'm concerned, I'm deeply concerned, about the events that are unfolding there. But I want to remind you that President Musharraf has been a valuable ally in the War on Terror, and his cooperation has been crucial in helping us take down key Al-Qaeda leaders and disrupt the terrorist networks that pose a threat to our security.\n\nNow, I understand the concerns about the state of emergency he's declared, and I've expressed those concerns directly to him. But I also believe it's essential to recognize the complexities of the situation on the ground in Pakistan. We want to see the return to democratic rule, no question, but we also don't want to push Pakistan in a direction that would allow the extremists to take over.\n\nSo I would reject the idea that there's a double standard here. The United States is committed to promoting democracy around the world, and we will continue to speak out for the values that we believe in. But we also have to be realistic about the circumstances on the ground, and we've got to work with our friends and allies to achieve our objectives.\n\nI think we should be judged by our actions, not by some hypothetical yardstick of consistency. We're working hard to support moderate voices in Pakistan, to promote democracy, and to help root out the terrorist threat that's a menace to us all. And I believe that our policy is guided by a clear commitment to our values, as well as a realistic assessment of the circumstances on the ground."

He was a tyrant, a dictator who had a history of aggression and a desire to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction.\n\nRegarding Iraq's WMD, there was intelligence suggesting that Saddam Hussein had the intention and the capability to reconstitute his WMD programs. And I relied on that intelligence when I made my decisions. While it's true that we didn't find stockpiles of WMD, I believe we made the right decision to take action.\n\nAs for Iran, I'm glad to hear that they've halted their nuclear program, but we need to verify that. We need to work with the international community to ensure that Iran doesn't resume its efforts to develop nuclear weapons.\n\nRegarding our credibility, I understand that there are those who disagree with our actions, but I can confidently say that we've taken the right decisions to protect our country and our interests. We're the leader of the free world, and we're going to continue to lead. We're going to continue to work with our allies to build coalitions and to confront threats to global security.\n\nAnd I reject the notion that we're the \"boy who cried wolf.\" We're a country that's taken seriously the threat of terror, the threat of proliferation, and the threat of tyranny. And we're going to continue to take those threats seriously and take action to address them.\n\nSo, I'm not concerned about our credibility. I believe that the world knows that we're a consistent and reliable partner, and that we're committed to defending freedom and defending our allies."

But I'll tell you this: we're not just sitting on our hands. We're taking action to address the root causes of the problem.\n\nFirst, we're working to get the markets stabilized.

That's critical to maintaining confidence in our system.\n\nAnd finally, we're looking at ways to address the causes of the crisis, particularly the housing market.\n\nNow, when it comes to specific proposals, I'd rather not get into details until later this week when we'll be laying out a comprehensive plan. But rest assured that we're considering a wide range of options to support homeowners, to stabilize the markets, and to prevent similar crises in the future.\n\nIt's going to be a tough road ahead, but I'm confident that with decisive action, we can work through this and keep our economy strong.

And I must say, I'm encouraged by the progress we've made.\n\nFirst of all, let's talk about the political sphere. We've seen a significant improvement in our dialogue and cooperation on a range of issues, including nonproliferation, counter-terrorism, and regional security. For example, we've worked together to address the threat posed by Iran's nuclear program, and we've made progress on the six-party talks with North Korea.\n\nIn the military sphere, we've increased our cooperation on counter-terrorism and nonproliferation efforts, including joint exercises and training programs. We've also begun to explore ways to increase transparency and confidence-building measures in our military relations.\n\nNow, when it comes to the economic sphere, I'm glad to report that we've seen significant progress in recent years. U.S.-Russia trade has increased by over 50% since 2001, and we're working to increase investment flows between our two countries. We've also established a number of new economic initiatives, including the U.S.-Russia Energy Working Group, which is focused on promoting cooperation in the energy sector.\n\nOne specific example of our economic cooperation is the agreement we've reached on uranium enrichment. Under this agreement, Russia will provide fuel for U.S. nuclear power plants, and we'll work together to develop a new generation of nuclear reactors that are more fuel-efficient and proliferation-resistant.\n\nSo, all in all, I'm proud of the progress we've made in our relations with Russia, and I'm optimistic about the future. We still have a lot of work to do, but I believe that our partnership will continue to grow and deepen in the years to come. Thank you."

But let me tell you, Andrew, we believe that another resolution is necessary to bring clarity and cohesion to the international community's efforts to disarm Saddam Hussein and hold him accountable for his actions.\n\nBy passing another resolution, we're sending a clear message to Saddam Hussein that the world will not tolerate his continued defiance of the UN and his failure to disarm. It's time for Saddam Hussein to take the UN seriously and comply with its resolutions.\n\nNow, I will admit, we are mindful of the fact that France and Russia have expressed some questions about the timing and content of the resolution. We're engaged in active consultations with them and other members of the Security Council to address their concerns.\n\nWe believe that a second resolution can provide a vital signal of unity and determination from the international community.

We're gonna have to work with the UN and the Iraqi people to make sure that this interim authority is one that's representing the Iraqi people, not the interests of the occupying force.\n\nNow, I think what I'd like to emphasize is that the mission of our coalition is to create the conditions for there to be an interim authority that's representative of the Iraqi people. And we'll work with the UN, and I think there's a lot of discussions going on between UN officials and our people, as well as with the Iraqis themselves, about how this is gonna work out.\n\nBut I must say, I think the idea of this... of an interim authority is something that we all agree on.

We believe that a strong and prosperous Philippines is not only good for the Filipino people, but also good for the region and for the world.\n\nTo achieve this, we're committed to supporting the Philippines' economic development efforts, particularly in areas such as trade, investment, and infrastructure development. We're also committed to supporting the Philippines' efforts to address the root causes of terrorism, such as poverty and inequality.\n\nIn addition, we're also working to strengthen our people-to-people ties, through educational exchanges, cultural exchanges, and tourism.

And I would encourage the international community to make clear to Syria that harboring terrorist organizations is unacceptable behavior.\n\nRegarding the second part of your question, we could work with Palestinian leaders who are committed to dismantling terrorist groups.

I mean, we've had our differences, particularly with Chancellor Merkel of Germany and President Chirac of France on issues like Iraq, but we've always maintained a level of respect and a commitment to working together on common goals like fighting terrorism and promoting global economic growth.\n\nYou know, I recall a conversation I had with Vladimir Putin at the G-8 Summit in Evian, where we had a real difference of opinion on the issue of Iraq. But, we were able to set that aside and work together on other issues like non-proliferation and energy security. That's what these personal relationships are all about.\n\nNow, I'm not naive, I know that policy differences can sometimes create tension, but I believe that when you can separate the policy differences from the personal relationships, that's when you can really get some work done.

We must continue to support the Iraqi forces as they build their capacity, and at the same time, we need to encourage the Iraqis to take ownership of their future.\n\nNow, with regards to the Vice President's assessment, I understand that the enemy is indeed wounded, but we must not underestimate them. They still pose a threat, and it'll take a sustained effort to secure victory. We should not misinterpret the enemy's willingness to fight as a sign of their strength, but rather as a sign of their increasing desperation.\n\nOur commanders on the ground and our experts here in Washington agree that the insurgency is being severely strained, and their losses are mounting. However, I do not believe it is accurate to say that they are in their last throes just yet. This is still a very tough fight, and we will see more days of tough fighting ahead.\n\nSo we will stay the course, support our troops, and bolster the Iraqis as they work towards stability and security.

Our goal would be to determine whether the Iranians are truly willing to work towards a peaceful, democratic, and sovereign Iraq, and to commit themselves to stopping the flow of arms and foreign fighters into the country.\n\nWe're not going to dance around the nuclear issue forever, and Iran must recognize this as a separate and distinct challenge that needs to be addressed. As a matter of fact, the discussions with the EU3 regarding the Iranian nuclear program will continue, and that remains our top concern. However, this separate channel could help to keep those broader issues in context.\n\nAnd to answer your question on the risk, let's be clear: it would be self-defeating to let another purely contentious issue - such as their nuclear program - consume and stop these talks. The goal of the initial talks would be to simply explore if a mutually beneficial atmosphere can be established to further Iraq's post-Saddam progression.\n\nHowever, on a separate track, the United States is prepared to move forward toward deeper engagement should Iran choose to demonstrate different behaviors."

As the President of the United States, I've had the opportunity to work with a number of leaders in the region, including President Vazquez of Uruguay and President Chavez of Venezuela.\n\nFirst, let me say that I believe in the importance of strong, democratic institutions in our hemisphere. And I think that's one area where there are some differences between some of the leaders in the region. President Vazquez, for example, has been a strong supporter of democratic institutions and has worked to strengthen the economy and promote social justice in Uruguay.\n\nOn the other hand, I've had my differences with President Chavez. While he was elected democratically, I've been concerned about some of the steps he's taken to consolidate power and restrict individual freedoms in Venezuela. And I've also been concerned about some of the rhetoric he's used, particularly with regard to the United States.\n\nNow, in terms of similarities, I think all of these leaders share a desire to promote economic growth and development in their countries. And I think they all recognize the importance of trade and investment in achieving that goal.\n\nAs for Uruguay, I have a lot of respect for President Vazquez and the Uruguayan people. Uruguay is a strong democracy with a long tradition of stability and the rule of law. And I think President Vazquez has done a good job of promoting economic growth and social justice in his country.\n\nOne area where we've worked closely with Uruguay is on trade. We recently completed a free trade agreement with Uruguay, which I think will help to promote economic growth and job creation in both our countries.\n\nOverall, I think President Vazquez is a leader who shares our commitment to democracy and free markets, and I look forward to continuing to work with him to promote a more prosperous and secure hemisphere."

From my perspective, the threat posed by Iran is a matter of grave concern, not just for the United States, but for the entire international community. As we all know, the IAEA has raised serious questions about the nature of Iran's nuclear program, and their enrichment activities, which we believe pose a risk of them developing a nuclear bomb.\n\nNow, I'm not going to speculate about the use of force, but I will tell you that all options are on the table. We will continue to work with our friends and allies to try to convince the Iranian regime to stop their pursuit of nuclear weapons. We believe it's in their interest, it's in the interest of the Iranian people, and it's in the interest of the entire region.\n\nAs I prepare to go to the U.N. next week, my message will be clear: we will not tolerate nuclear proliferation. The international community has spoken through the Security Council resolutions, and Iran must comply with those resolutions. We'll work with our friends and allies to try to find a peaceful resolution to this problem, but make no mistake, we will defend our interests, we will defend our friends, and we will defend the security of the world from the threat posed by a nuclear Iran.\n\nAnd to my friends in Europe, and particularly to the French, I say we appreciate your willingness to join us in this cause. We will continue to work closely together to convince the Iranians to abandon their nuclear ambitions, and to find a peaceful solution to this problem.\n\nBut let's be clear: the burden is on Iran. They must choose a different path, a path that leads to prosperity, to stability, and to a future that is peaceful for their people and for the world."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for that question. You know, I've had the privilege of serving this great nation for seven years now, and I've learned a thing or two about what it takes to be a good leader. In my opinion, experience in government is incredibly important. You can't just walk into this job without knowing how to get things done in Washington. You gotta know how the system works, how to build coalitions, how to work with Congress.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that's the only thing that's important. You've also got to have core principles, a strong sense of values. For me, my faith has always been a guiding light. As a Methodist, my faith has taught me the importance of compassion, of helping those in need, and of standing up for what's right, even when it's hard.\n\nNow, I don't think a candidate's specific denomination is as important as their values and their character. What I care about is whether they're a person of integrity, whether they're honest, and whether they're willing to make tough decisions.\n\nBut I do think that a candidate's worldview, shaped in part by their faith, can be an important factor in how they make decisions. You see, as President, you're not just making decisions for yourself, you're making decisions for the entire country. And if you don't have a strong sense of what's right and wrong, it's easy to get swayed by special interests or polls.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I think experience in government is crucial, but it's not the only thing that matters. A candidate's values, their character, and their worldview are just as important. And as for their religious views, I think it's okay to ask questions, but what matters most is whether they're a person of integrity and principle."

Rwanda and the United States have a strong bilateral relationship, and we've been working together on a number of areas, including trade and investment.\n\nWhile I don't recall a specific investment treaty that we've signed recently, I can tell you that we've been exploring ways to strengthen our economic ties with Rwanda, and that includes increased investment in key sectors such as energy, agriculture, and infrastructure.\n\nOur goal is to create a more favorable business climate for American companies to invest in Rwanda, and to encourage Rwandan businesses to invest in the United States as well. We believe that this can lead to mutual benefits, including job creation, economic growth, and poverty reduction.\n\nBut specifics about a particular treaty, I'd have to check on that and get back to you.

We need a comprehensive plan, and we need it soon.\n\nI'll be discussing this further with our allies, including Prime Minister Brown, and we'll make a determination about attendance at the summit based on our own interests and the interests of the American people.

That's a necessary step, and we expect him to do so.\n\nSecondly, he must stop enabling groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, who are taking innocent lives and undermining the stability of the region. These groups are not friends of peace; they are enemies of peace.\n\nThirdly, he must begin to respect the sovereignty of Lebanon and allow that country to chart its own course, free from Syrian interference.\n\nAnd fourthly, he must begin to cooperate with us on the war on terror. We've had problems with Syria in the past, and we expect them to help us in this global effort to defeat the terrorists.\n\nNow, I know that some people might say that by making these requests, we're being too tough on President al-Asad. But I believe that's the wrong way to look at it. We're making these requests because we believe that they're essential to achieving the goals that we all share: stability, peace, and prosperity in the region.\n\nAnd I've made it clear, by the way, that we're willing to work with the Syrians if they're willing to work with us. We're willing to have diplomatic relations, to have cultural exchanges, to have trade. We want to have normal relations with Syria, but it's going to take some effort on their part.\n\nAnd I hope that President al-Asad will take these requests seriously, because we're not going to back off. We're going to continue to push for the kind of reform and the kind of behavior that we believe is necessary for the region to be peaceful."

What we've done is take steps to address the problems we're facing, and that's what we did with Freddie and Fannie.\n\nI want to assure the American people that our goal is to promote market discipline, to promote transparency, and to promote regulation that works. We've taken steps to strengthen the regulatory framework, and we're committed to making sure that our financial institutions operate in a way that's safe and sound.\n\nNow, I know some folks might say, \"Well, this sets a bad precedent.\" But I believe that in this unique circumstance, where we had a systemic risk to the entire financial system, we had to take action.

As the President of the United States, it's my duty to promote freedom and human rights around the world, and China is no exception.\n\nDuring my trip to Beijing, I do plan to meet with Chinese leaders, and I will make it very clear that the United States is committed to promoting religious freedom and human rights.\n\nRegarding meeting with dissidents and Christian activists, I will not be meeting with them publicly, as that would likely create more tension with the Chinese government. However, I will be making it clear to the Chinese leaders that the United States values our relationship with China, but that relationship is not at the expense of our values.\n\nAs for what actions we plan to take, I've instructed our Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, to work closely with the Chinese government to encourage them to take steps to improve their human rights record. We're going to continue to provide humanitarian assistance and we will work with other countries to promote a United Nations resolution on China's human rights record.\n\nThe American people care about human rights and religious freedom, and so do I.

Let me be clear: I believe we need a comprehensive approach to immigration reform that addresses the unique circumstances of different countries and populations.\n\nHowever, I also believe that we must abide by our laws, and we're working with Congress to address some of these disparities. We've taken steps to ensure that Haitian immigrants are treated fairly and humanely, including increasing the number of refugees we're accepting from Haiti and providing more assistance to those who are fleeing persecution.\n\nBut I also want to emphasize that our policy towards Haitian immigrants is not driven by a desire to discriminate, but rather by a need to manage the flow of migrants in a safe and orderly manner. We've got a moral obligation to protect those who are fleeing violence and persecution, but we also have a responsibility to protect our borders and our national security.\n\nNow, I know that there are some who believe that our policy towards Haitian immigrants is unfair, and I understand those concerns. But I want to assure the American people that we're working hard to address these issues, and we're committed to finding a solution that is fair and compassionate and respects the dignity of all immigrants.\n\nAnd let me just say that, you know, I've met with some of these immigrants, and I've seen firsthand the struggles they're facing, and it's just... it's heartbreaking.

We took a hard look at our policy options in the region, and that's something all administrations do when they come into office.\n\nBut I must correct the notion that we started planning for an invasion of Iraq just days after our inauguration. That's just not accurate. Our early deliberations were focused on how to handle the existing sanctions and contain Saddam's aggressive ambitions.\n\nAs for whether I feel betrayed, I think Paul O'Neill's given some... interesting insights into our early deliberations, and I think we can have a constructive debate about our policy choices. But that being said, I also believe that releasing classified documents can be a serious matter, and it's not something that should be taken lightly.\n\nI think it's essential for those who have access to sensitive information to handle it responsibly and with the appropriate channels, rather than leaking it to the press."

This is something that we've been discussing for some time, and I'm hopeful that we'll see some positive developments in the coming weeks and months.\n\nRegarding the question of whether the bitter differences over the war are over, I think it's too early to say that.

But I've spoken to General Casey and our ambassador, and they're working closely with the Iraqi government to ensure that the security measures are in place to protect the voters.\n\nYou know, the most difficult thing for the terrorists to accept is the fact that Iraq is becoming a free society. They can't stand the thought of free people voting, and so they're gonna try to intimidate 'em. But I think the Iraqi people are gonna surprise 'em. They're gonna show up to vote, and they're gonna vote for a government that they've chosen.\n\nNow, as to the credibility of the elections, I think they'll be credible.

While we're still gathering information about the specifics of Mr. Hariri's assassination, it's clear that Syria's actions have contributed to the instability in the region.\n\nAs for expelling Syria from Lebanon, we support the international community's calls for Syria to fully comply with UN Security Council Resolution 1559, which demands the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon. We're working closely with our allies, including the Lebanese government, to bring pressure on Syria to respect Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nWe'll continue to support the efforts of the UN-sponsored investigation into Mr. Hariri's assassination, and we'll consider all options, including further economic and diplomatic sanctions, to pressure Syria to change its behavior. Our goal is to support the people of Lebanon in their efforts to reclaim their country and to bring stability to the region.\n\nIt's worth noting that we've already imposed sanctions on Syria in response to its support for terrorism and its activities in Lebanon. We're going to continue to work with our allies to isolate Syria diplomatically and economically until they comply with the international community's demands."

As the President of the United States, I've advocated for the sanctity of human life and the importance of opposing euthanasia in all its forms.\n\nRegarding the reinsertion of the feeding tube, I believe that every effort should be made to preserve life, especially in a case like this where there's still some ambiguity regarding Terri's wishes. I think it's crucial to ensure that we're giving Terri the chance she deserves to live with dignity.\n\nAs for discussions with my brother Governor Jeb Bush, we've indeed talked about the situation and the various options available. We're both committed to doing what's right and pursuing every possible avenue to save Terri's life. We're also working closely with the Congress to explore legislative options that could help resolve this situation and ensure the protection of vulnerable individuals like Terri.\n\nI want to emphasize that this is a complex and difficult issue, and we need to proceed with caution and compassion. However, I'm committed to standing up for the principles of life and dignity, and I will continue to do everything in my power to support efforts to save Terri's life."

And I'm not paying attention to the polls, to be frank with you. My focus is on doing what's right for the American people, making sure our economy is strong, and keeping this country safe.\n\nNow, on Social Security, I believe that reform is necessary to ensure the long-term solvency of the program. We need to make adjustments to make sure that Social Security is there for future generations of Americans. And we've made some progress on that front, but I understand that there's still work to be done.\n\nRegarding gas prices, we're doing everything we can to encourage conservation, to increase supply, and to address the demand for gasoline. It's a global problem, and it's a complex issue, but we're working hard to bring prices down.\n\nAnd on the economy, I'm proud of the progress we've made. We've created millions of new jobs, we've cut taxes, and we've taken steps to make America more competitive in the global economy.\n\nNow, I will say that I'm not satisfied with the pace of progress on some of these issues, and I'm working hard with my team to make sure that we're making the case to the American people about the importance of these issues. And I'm confident that, in the end, we'll get there.\n\nBut I want to assure the American people that I'm not deterred by the criticisms or the polls. I'm focused on doing what's right for this country, and I'm committed to seeing this through.\n\nAnd as for the Congress, I work well with the Republican Congress, and I'm proud of the progress we've made on a number of issues, including tax reform, education reform, and homeland security. We've had some disagreements, but that's the nature of the relationship between the executive and legislative branches."

We're not gonna let 'em dictate our strategy or our policy. We'll continue to work with our coalition partners to build a stable, democratic Iraq, and we'll do everything in our power to protect our troops and the Iraqi people.\n\nNow, regarding the recent losses we've suffered, I want to express my deep condolences to the families of those brave marines who've given their last full measure of devotion. We take every loss very seriously. We're constantly assessin' and reassessin' our tactics and strategies to minimize risks and protect our troops.\n\nWe're workin' closely with our military commanders and intelligence agencies to disrupt and dismantle Al-Qaeda's networks and to go after its leaders. We'll also continue to work with the Iraqi security forces to build up their capabilities, so they can take on more responsibility for their own security.\n\nWe're doin' everything we can to protect our troops and to complete our mission in Iraq.

First of all, let me just say that we're proud of the fact that we've had a strong economy, a resilient economy, in the United States. We've had low unemployment, strong job growth, and a growing economy. And I think it's a tribute to the American people, who are the backbone of our economy.\n\nNow, with regard to interest rates, we're monitoring the situation very closely. We believe that the Federal Reserve has a good handle on monetary policy, and we expect them to make decisions that will, in fact, promote economic growth and stability.\n\nAs interest rates have begun to rise, we're watching to see how that affects the overall economy. And I think it's worth noting that a gradual increase in interest rates is a natural part of a growing economy. It's a sign of a strong economy, actually.\n\nNow, we're always concerned about any potential impact on the economy, but we don't think that the recent increase in interest rates will slow down the momentum of the economy. In fact, we think that the American economy is strong enough to withstand a gradual increase in interest rates.\n\nWe're also working to keep our economy strong by keeping taxes low, by promoting free trade, and by encouraging small businesses to grow and thrive. So, while we're watching the situation closely, we're confident that the American economy will continue to grow and prosper.\n\nAnd I'd just like to remind everyone, it's always good to be cautious, but we can't let fear dictate our decisions. We've got to make decisions based on the facts, and the facts are, this is a strong, resilient economy that can withstand the natural fluctuations of interest rates."

Let me start by saying that we believe Iran's nuclear program is a serious threat to the security of the international community, and we're committed to working through diplomatic channels to resolve this issue.\n\nAs for referring Iran to the U.N. Security Council, we've been working closely with our allies and partners, including the European Union, to build a consensus on this issue. While we haven't yet seen the full results of the EU's efforts to engage with the Iranians, it's clear that Iran's actions are unacceptable and require a strong international response.\n\nRegarding the Security Council, I believe it's certainly an option that's on the table. We'll continue to work with our allies to build support for a unified international response, and we're prepared to act decisively if Iran fails to meet its obligations.\n\nNow, I know that China has historically been a country that prefers a more diplomatic approach, and we respect that. But I believe we can work with China and other countries to build a consensus on the need for Iran to comply with its international obligations. We'll be engaging directly with China and other key players to make our case, and we're confident that, together, we can find a way forward that addresses the concerns of all parties.\n\nUltimately, the goal here is not to isolate or punish Iran, but to ensure that the international community comes together to prevent the spread of nuclear technology to rogue states and terrorist organizations. We believe that's in everyone's interest, and we're committed to working through diplomacy to achieve that goal."

The program in question is focused on identifying and disrupting terrorist plots, and it's focused on foreign, international communications, primarily. We've got a program in place that is designed to gather intelligence for the sole purpose of preventing attacks on the American people.\n\nI want to remind the American people that this government does not listen to domestic conversations. We're not trolling through the lives of innocent Americans. The program is careful. It's designed to ensure that the rights of the American people are protected. Now, I know some people may have concerns, but I want to assure you that the program is limited and is focused, and that we're protecting the American people.\n\nWe're working with the Congress to ensure that the rights of the American people are protected. To the extent that we can declassify information, we'll do so, to show the American people the seriousness with which we take this issue. But, again, I'll repeat: our first duty is to protect the American people. We've got to balance that duty with the need to stand on the offense against the terrorists, and we will do so.\n\nWe can't disclose the details of the program for obvious reasons, but I assure you, we are committed to protecting the American people and their rights, and we'll work with the Congress to make sure that's the case."

It's heartbreaking to see innocent civilians caught in the crossfire of this brutal conflict.\n\nRegarding the Iraqi government's efforts, I would say that while there's certainly been progress, we're not satisfied with the pace of progress. The Iraqi government has made some difficult decisions, but it's clear they must do more to address the sectarian violence and bring the people of Iraq together.\n\nIt's a tough road ahead, but I remain committed to supporting the Iraqi people and their government as they work towards a more stable and secure future. Our strategy, as outlined by Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus, is focused on achieving a surge in both military and economic efforts, as well as encouraging the Iraqis to make tough decisions on reconciliation and governance.\n\nWe're making progress, but it's slow and difficult. And we're committed to supporting the Iraqi government as they work towards that goal."

But I think Prime Minister Maliki is working hard to unite the country, to make sure that Iraq is a part of the neighborhood, that it's a reliable ally in the region.\n\nNow, when I said I'm not satisfied, I'm not satisfied with the pace of progress, and I think there needs to be faster movement on the legislative front. We need to see some reconciliation, we need to see some adjustment of laws that will help bring greater investment into Iraq. And it's not just Iraq's responsibilities. The international community can do a better job in helping Iraq.\n\nNow, when we came into power, we were met with, you know, a large army that was defeated. But the insurgency, however, continued to thrive. And it's taken time for us to adjust tactics, it's taken time to come up with the right strategies. It's a tough neighborhood, the Middle East, and there's no doubt about it.\n\nSo, when I said I'm dissatisfied with the pace, that's what I'm dissatisfied with. It doesn't mean I'm dissatisfied with Prime Minister Maliki. It means we need to continue to work together in a collaborative fashion."

Now, when it comes to Iran, we have been very clear about our concerns regarding their nuclear program, as well as their support for terrorism. We've been working with our international partners to address these concerns, and we remain committed to a diplomatic solution.\n\nNow, we've had our differences with the Iranian government, no doubt about it. But I believe that we have to continue to explore every possible option to resolve this issue peacefully. And that's why we're working with the Europeans, the United Nations, and other members of the international community to apply pressure on the Iranian government to comply with the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) and to suspend their uranium enrichment activities.\n\nIn terms of leverage, I think we've got some. First and foremost, the international community is united in their concern about Iran's nuclear program. And the Security Council has passed a number of resolutions that reflect this concern. So, we've got a united front. This is not just a U.S. issue; this is an issue that affects the entire world.\n\nWe're also working with our partners to impose economic sanctions on Iran. Now, I know that some people say these sanctions don't work. But I believe that when you put pressure on a country, it can encourage them to think differently about their behavior.\n\nNow, the other point I want to make is that we're not just talking about diplomacy. We're also talking about maintaining a strong military presence in the region. And we will continue to work with our partners to make sure that we're prepared for any eventuality.\n\nBut, I believe that the best option is to resolve this issue through diplomacy. And we're giving it our best shot. We're working hard to find a solution that's acceptable to everyone. And I remain hopeful that we can resolve this issue peacefully."

And I appreciate the fact that members of Congress are expressing their concerns. But what I disagree with is imposing a withdrawal timetable. I think it's bad policy. It sends the wrong signal to the enemy, and it's not in the best interest of our troops.\n\nNow, in terms of breaking the logjam, I'm more than happy to work with members of Congress to find common ground. I've invited them to the White House, and I'll continue to do so. I believe we can have a reasonable discussion about the way forward in Iraq. But what I won't do is compromise on the idea of timetabling withdrawals, because I genuinely believe it will embolden the enemy and it won't allow our troops to be able to succeed.\n\nAs for vetoing a second bill, I will veto any bill that comes to my desk that's got a withdrawal timetable in it. I'm not going to have a situation where our troops are in the field, and Congress is essentially telling them, we don't think we can win. I'm not going to allow that to happen. So, yes, I'll veto another bill if it's got a withdrawal timetable in it.\n\nNow, I am open to working with Congress on supplementals, on funding our troops, on making sure they've got what they need to succeed. We need to give General Petraeus the tools he needs to succeed in Iraq. And I'm willing to work with them to find a way to express support for our troops.

It's a signal that the Fed is watching the economy closely and is taking proactive steps to help stimulate growth. Now, I don't make monetary policy decisions, that's the Fed's job, and I think Chairman Greenspan is doing a fine job.\n\nAs for whether it's enough to stave off a recession, I'm cautiously optimistic. We've got a resilient economy, and I believe the rate cut will help to boost consumer confidence and investment. But let's be clear, there are still challenges ahead, and we're working hard to address them.\n\nWe've already taken some steps to support the economy, such as the tax cuts we passed in 2001 and the stimulus package we passed last year. We're also working with Congress to address some of the underlying issues that are affecting American families and businesses, like high energy prices and the need for more investment in our infrastructure.\n\nNow, I'm not one to speculate about future economic policy decisions, but I will say that we're always looking for ways to support American families and businesses.

And I think it's something that the Democrats and the Republicans in Congress should take a good hard look at.

I think there should be an inquiry to determine all the facts. I think it's something that we should not just dismiss out of hand. The public has a right to know the truth, and it's very important that Congress takes a serious look into this matter.\n\nNow, I don't want to pre-judge what the investigation finds, but I do think there should be a serious look into the allegations that have been made, not just about - not just about the facts surrounding the pardons, but also the - the decision-making process that went in effect.\n\nThat's what we do in a democracy. We have two branches of government that work together. In this instance, the Legisative should do its job, which is to do its oversight. And that's what I think should happen."

For years, they have been expressing their opposition to the naval bombing exercises, and I think it's essential that we hear their voices.\n\nNow, as Commander-in-Chief, I also have a responsibility to ensure our military is well-prepared to defend our great nation. But, I believed we could find other ways to do that, without causing tension and harm to the good people of Vieques.\n\nOf course, I'd be less than honest if I said politics didn't play a role. The concerns of Hispanic Americans, not just in Puerto Rico, but also in the mainland, were also taken into consideration. It's crucial for us as a nation to be responsive to all our citizens, and to balance the needs of our military with the needs of our people.\n\nBut let me make it very clear: the security of our great nation is always my top priority.

They're dedicated public servants, and they understand the importance of their mission. I have every confidence that they will continue to carry out their duties with the same professionalism and dedication that they have always shown.\n\nAs for the question of blame, I don't think it's productive to point fingers or assess blame at this time. We've had a thorough review of the intelligence leading up to the war in Iraq, and we've identified areas where we can improve. The 9/11 Commission and the WMD Commission have also made recommendations for reform.\n\nThose reforms are already underway, and we're working closely with the Congress to implement the necessary changes. We're committed to ensuring that our intelligence community has the tools and the resources they need to carry out their critical mission.

What I will say is that we're making progress, and we will continue to work closely with the Iraqi government and the Iraqi security forces to transfer responsibility to them.\n\nAs the Iraqis take more responsibility for their own security, it will enable us to adjust our troop levels. And I think it's reasonable to expect that we can have a substantial reduction in our troop levels over the course of the next year. But I want to be clear: any decisions on troop levels will be based on conditions on the ground, not on artificial timelines.\n\nWe're making progress, and we'll continue to work towards our goal of a free and self-governing Iraq.

Well, I think it's safe to say that President Putin's decision to potentially become the Prime Minister is a matter of great interest to the United States and to the world.\n\nI'll be honest with you, I've always believed that Russia's retreat from democratic values has been a cause for concern. And this development, it seems to me, just reinforces that notion.\n\nA President who has been in office for a number of years, term-limited, and now is seeking to possibly become the Prime Minister \u2013 it raises some questions about how they view the separation of powers, the checks and balances that are essential to a democratic system.\n\nLook, I've worked with President Putin on a number of issues \u2013 Iran, proliferation, and Counterterrorism, to name a few. But when it comes to the state of democracy in Russia, I have been disappointed, really. We haven't seen the kind of progress that we would have liked to see in terms of consolidating democratic institutions, independent judiciary, independent media, and so forth.\n\nAnd so, when you see a leader potentially holding onto power in this way, it does raise concerns about the health of Russian democracy."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question. I'm proud to say that the first $350 billion of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, also known as TARP, has been, by and large, a success. It's helped stabilize the financial markets, and it's helped keep credit flowing to small businesses and families.\n\nNow, as for whether every single dollar has been spent wisely, I think that's a fair question. There have been some concerns raised about the way some of the funds have been allocated. But overall, I believe that Secretary Paulson, working with the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, have taken the necessary steps to get the funds out the door quickly and effectively.\n\nNow, with regard to the second $350 billion, I understand that Congress is considering placing some restrictions on its use. Let me say: I support Congress's desire to exercise strong oversight. As I've consistently said, taxpayer dollars should be used wisely and in a way that strengthens our economy.\n\nI think we should be careful not to impose so many restrictions that it would slow down the effectiveness of the program. We need to make sure that Secretary Geithner and the Treasury Department have the flexibility to respond to the changing economic conditions.\n\nBut I do believe that we should have some robust oversight and transparency. I've said that from the beginning, and I'm glad to see that Congress is coming around to that view as well."

The sanctions, as you know, have been in place for a considerable amount of time, and the goal is to make sure that we keep pressure on the Saddam Hussein regime to disarm, and to comply with the inspection teams.\n\nWe believe, Secretary Powell and I, that the sanctions should remain in place, because we don't want to see Saddam Hussein get a free pass. We want to see him comply with the international community. We want to see him get rid of his weapons of mass destruction. We want to see him treat his people with respect.\n\nNow, having said that, we're also concerned about the humanitarian aspects, and that's why we've worked with the United Nations to make sure that, through the Oil for Food program, Iraqis get the kind of humanitarian aid that they need. We're concerned about the suffering, and we're trying to find a way to alleviate that suffering.\n\nNow, as for the reconstituting the sanctions, Secretary Powell and I have been working with our allies, and we're committed to finding a new framework, a framework that's smart, a framework that keeps the pressure on Saddam Hussein, but also takes into account the needs of the Iraqi people. We're working on this very issue, and we're hopeful that we can find a way forward that meets both objectives.\n\nBut let me be very clear: we will not lift sanctions, we will not ease pressure on Saddam Hussein, until he disarms, until he complies with the international inspectors. We will not give him a free pass to continue the kind of activities that threaten the world."

I did not give him a specific figure, but I made it clear that we're committed to significant reductions. And I think we can work together to find a mutually agreeable range that will help to reduce the nuclear threat and make the world a safer place.\n\nBut I do want to emphasize that our commitment to missile defense remains unwavering. We will continue to develop and deploy effective missile defense systems, and we will not be bound by outdated treaties that limit our ability to do so. We're looking to the future, and we're looking for a new relationship with Russia, one that's based on cooperation, trust, and mutual understanding."

We're leading a coalition, if you will, of nations who are concerned about Saddam Hussein's behavior.\n\nBut, you see, as President of the United States, I'll never take options off the table. And we'll continue to work with the international community to make sure that we protect the American people and our friends and allies from the threat that Saddam Hussein poses.\n\nNow, I said that's a hypothetical situation. I'm optimistic that we can work with the international community to achieve our goal, which is to disarm Saddam Hussein. But, you know, I also said as commander-in-chief of the United States, I will manage this threat using all available options.\n\nI'm not going to tie my hands behind my back, and I'm going to talk about options, and I'm not going to talk about the options.

He is the leader of the Palestinian Authority, and he's had many opportunities to work with the Israeli government to find peace. Instead, we have seen violence and rejectionism from some elements of the Palestinian Authority, and he hasn't done enough, in my judgment, to stop that.\n\nNow, as for whose side he's on, I think it's clear that Chairman Arafat has been unwilling to take steps necessary to take down terrorist organizations within his own territory. He has had the opportunity to work with the United States and other nations to help him take on the terrorist organizations, and we've not seen the necessary effort and commitment to do that.\n\nRegarding your last question, I think the world will be a better place without those who advocate violence and hatred. I'm not going to speculate on individual personalities. I will say that we're going to continue to work for peace, and that requires, in my view, an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue that leads to a negotiated settlement that's based upon secure borders and free societies for the Palestinian people."

The Israelis need to be secure, and the Palestinians need to have a hopeful future.\n\nAs for a meeting with Sharon and Abbas, I'm open to meeting with them whenever and wherever the time is right. I think a meeting in Egypt or Europe could be a good idea. Let's see how things develop. The key is to keep the momentum moving, to keep the process going, and I believe we're making progress.\n\nBut I want to remind everybody that this is just the beginning.

We've been monitoring the situation closely and are working with our international partners, particularly China, to address this issue.\n\nLet me be clear: the United States will not accept North Korea's continued pursuit of nuclear capabilities. We've made it clear to the North Koreans that they need to dismantle their nuclear programs, including any secret sites, and we'll continue to work towards that goal.\n\nRegarding the talks, we're still hopeful that China can play a constructive role in helping to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table. We're continuing to work closely with the Chinese to encourage them to use their influence to persuade the North Koreans to abandon their nuclear ambitions. However, we're also clear-eyed about the challenges ahead, and we'll continue to pursue all available options to address this threat.\n\nIt's worth noting that North Korea's actions are not only a threat to regional stability, but also to global non-proliferation efforts. We'll continue to work with our allies and partners to address this issue and to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.\n\nWe'll be monitoring the situation closely, and we'll take all necessary steps to protect our interests and our allies in the region.

And we're gonna use the tools that are most effective in solvin' that problem.\n\nNow, NATO is a very important alliance, it's a vital alliance. I want to emphasize that. We value our relationships with our NATO partners immensely. They're our friends, our allies. We work together to address the challenges we face.\n\nBut sometimes, situations arise that require a more flexible response. And that's when we may not be able to rely on every single member of NATO to participate. Now, I'm not sayin' that NATO can't be effective. It certainly can be.\n\nWhat we're lookin' for is the ability to respond quickly, to be agile, to adapt to changing circumstances. And if that means creatin' a coalition of the willin', so be it. I mean, we can't just sit around and wait for everybody to agree on everything. We gotta be able to move.\n\nNow, I know some folks might interpret this as a sign that we don't value our NATO alliance. That's just not true. We do. We value our relationships with our allies. But we also gotta be realistic about the complexity of the world we're livin' in.\n\nWe face different types of threats now. We face asymmetric threats, we face terrorist threats. And we need to be able to respond in ways that are effective, that are adaptable, that are flexible.\n\nSo, I think Secretary Rumsfeld was makin' a valid point. We gotta be able to use all the tools at our disposal, and that includes our NATO alliance, but it may also include other types of coalitions, other types of partners, to address these challenges."

However, as you noted, we still have an important mission to complete, and these Illinois National Guard units play a critical role in helping the Iraqis stand up their own capabilities.\n\nAs for the families of these Guardsmen, I want to assure them that we're committed to supporting them throughout this deployment. We're doing everything in our power to ensure the continued safety and well-being of our troops.

The Prime Minister and I agree that the Iraqi government must take a lead role in providing security for its own people, but we also acknowledge that the US has a responsibility to support them in this effort.\n\nNow, in terms of troop levels, I've asked the Joint Chiefs to review our military presence in Iraq and provide me with recommendations on what's necessary to achieve our objectives.

A competitive dollar is crucial to our export sector's continued success.

We're working to keep inflation in check, and that's helping to maintain a strong dollar. The Federal Reserve has done a good job of keeping interest rates low, which also supports the value of the dollar.\n\nWe're also working to help our exporters compete in the global marketplace through initiatives like the free trade agreements we've negotiated. These agreements are opening up new markets for U.S. goods and services, and they're helping our exporters to grow.\n\nBut I do want to caution that trade is a two-way street.

In fact, I think it's essential. And I'm glad to be able to talk about it, and I'm glad to have a relationship with faith leaders across the country who help me make some tough decisions."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you very much. I'm glad to be here today to talk about the Middle East, a region that's very important to our national security and to the stability of the world.\n\nFirst of all, I want to make it clear that my goal, our goal, is to create an environment in the Middle East where democracy and freedom can flourish. We believe that the best way to bring about peace and stability in the region is to promote democratic values and democratic institutions.\n\nIn the next year, I'd like to see the Iraqi people continue to make progress towards building a sovereign, democratic government. We've made significant strides in that regard, but there's more work to be done. I'd like to see the Iraqi security forces become more capable of defending their own country, and we'll continue to support them in that effort.\n\nIn Afghanistan, I'd like to see the Taliban and Al-Qaeda continue to be defeated, and for the Afghan people to consolidate their gains towards building a free and democratic society. We'll continue to support our friends in Afghanistan, President Karzai and the Afghan people, as they make progress towards stability and prosperity.\n\nIn the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I'd like to see the parties make progress towards a two-state solution, where Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in peace and security. We'll continue to support the roadmap for peace, which envisions a Palestinian state that's free and democratic, and secure for all the people of the region.\n\nIn Iran, I'd like to see the Iranian government listen to the voice of its people, and to begin to take steps towards greater freedom and democracy. We'll continue to support the people of Iran who are yearning for freedom and democracy.\n\nIn Lebanon, I'd like to see the Lebanese people continue to consolidate their democratic gains, and for the government to be able to exert its authority throughout the country. We'll continue to support the Lebanese government and the Lebanese people as they make progress towards stability and prosperity.\n\nAnd finally, I'd like to see the Gulf states, our friends in the Gulf, continue to take steps towards greater freedom and democracy. We'll continue to support our friends in the region as they make progress towards stability and prosperity.\n\nThese are ambitious goals, but we're committed to working towards them, and we believe that with the support of our international partners, we can make a real difference in the lives of the people of the Middle East. Thank you."

    "gen_response": "Well, thank you for that question. You know, I've always believed that it's in our nation's interest to promote freedom and democracy around the world. It's not just a moral imperative; it's also a strategic imperative. When people are free, they're more likely to be our friends and allies.\n\nRegarding the troop issue, I believe it's crucial for the United States to support our friends and allies who are working towards democratic progress. We've got a responsibility to help those who are seeking freedom and democracy, and we've also got a responsibility to protect our national security interests.\n\nNow, when it comes to separatist regions, it's a complex issue. My commitment to democracy is unwavering, but that doesn't necessarily mean that we support independence for every separatist region. We've got to look at each situation on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAs I've said before, our goal is to promote democracy and freedom, but it's also to promote stability and security. We've got to be careful not to inadvertently fuel separatist movements that could lead to more instability and conflict.\n\nSo, what we're trying to do is support democratic development and reform, so that people have a stake in their future and don't feel the need to seek independence. We want to work with governments and peoples to build institutions, to promote economic development, and to support the rule of law.\n\nUltimately, the question of independence is a decision for the people of a given region to make, but we'll always support those who are working towards democracy and freedom. That's our commitment. That's what we stand for as a nation."

We've been working closely with our international partners, including Germany, to address the situation at Guantanamo.\n\nAs you know, the detention center at Guantanamo was established to hold enemy combatants who were picked up on the battlefields of Afghanistan and elsewhere. Our goal has been to find a way to safely and securely bring these detainees to justice, while also ensuring that we're protecting the American people from further terrorist attacks.\n\nI've authorized the Secretary of Defense to work with the Department of Justice and the State Department to explore options for closing the facility, but we need to make sure that any decisions we make are consistent with our national security interests and that we have a plan in place to handle the detainees in a way that protects the American people.\n\nWe've already made significant progress in reducing the number of detainees at Guantanamo, and we're committed to continuing that process. However, we cannot simply release these individuals into the general population, as some of them have been determined to be a threat to our national security.\n\nI'm willing to consider alternative approaches, but we must ensure that any solution we adopt is one that protects the American people and our allies, while also upholding our values and our commitment to the rule of law.\n\n(turning to Chancellor Merkel) Chancellor, I'd be happy to hear your thoughts on this issue and how we can work together to address your concerns."

    "gen_response": "Well, thank you for your question. I appreciate it. The plan we put forth is a vision for peace, it's a two-state solution, just as you mentioned. It provides for the Palestinian people to have their own country, their own state, based on certain conditions, which are delineated in the plan. I believe it's very important to have a vision of what could be. It is not a dictate, it is not a, you know, a \"here's the deal, take it or leave it,\" but rather, it's, this is what could happen.\n\nAnd so, we strongly believe in the two-state solution, and I believe there are many Israelis and Palestinians who want a two-state solution as well. Now, we certainly believe the Palestinian leadership needs to be involved in any discussions about this plan. And the reason we brought the plan out is we want to facilitate the discussions to be able to figure out the better way forward.\n\nAnd it's not a determination that Israel's final borders will not be negotiated. But what it does do, is give a clear vision to where to go. It's like, you know, when you're trying to get to a big city, I'm trying to get to New York City. It's good to have a map. It's good to know the direction you're headed. And that's what we provided, is a direction for a two-state solution that we think could be beneficial to both sides.\n\nIt's very important, however, for people to recognize that there are still issues that will have to be discussed and resolved. And the issues that can't be resolved off the bat, such as borders, refugees, Jerusalem \u2013 there's the concept of Jerusalem and what happens to it in the future, and also, the importance of ensuring that this state should be sovereign, but not created as a takeover of another state but extending the rights of the people in Judea and Samaria, would still have to come about.\n\nLet me make it clear to you. No, these weren't take-it-or-leave-it proposals put on the table. It is a series of the whole base of proposals and potential visions for continued dialogue and fruitful negotiations so that both sides can be better off for coming together for their mutual betterment."

We've confirmed that Zarqawi is no longer a threat, and that's a significant development in our efforts to bring stability to Iraq. But I also want to remind everyone that this is a continuing operation. The work of our brave men and women in Iraq is far from over.\n\nWe've got to stay focused on the big picture. We can't just declare victory and then see the terrorists regroup and start causing more harm. The fact that Zarqawi's been taken care of does not mean that the insurgency is going to go away instantly. We've still got a lot of work to do.\n\nNow, when Saddam Hussein was captured, that was a major milestone. We've been saying that this was a guy who had the potential to be a major threat to the security of our country, and by capturing him, we also achieved a significant goal of the multinational force in Iraq.\n\nIn this case, I do think Zarqawi's death is a significant blow to the insurgency, but we've got to be measured in our response. We cannot be shouting \"mission accomplished\" when, in fact, there's still much work to be done."

First of all, we've worked to reduce the threat of North Korea's nuclear program. We've gotten them to agree to the denuclearization of the peninsula, and we've also gotten them to agree to inspections, to have the international community come in and verify their compliance. That's a major achievement.\n\nSecondly, we've worked to interdict shipments of dangerous materials, like missile components, that North Korea was seeking to acquire from other countries. We've worked with our allies, like Japan and South Korea, to strengthen their defenses, to make sure they're better prepared to deal with the North Korean threat.\n\nNow when it comes to the Six-Party Talks, those talks were designed to bring the key stakeholders in the region together to discuss the issues, try to resolve the issues. And I believe they've been productive. Now, I know some of my critics say, \"Why are you still talking to them, the North Koreans, if they're not living up to their commitments?\" And my response is, \"We're talking to them because we're trying to change their behavior.\"\n\nNow I understand that some people may think that's naive. I don't think it's naive. I think it's necessary. Because the consequences of failure are too great to ignore this problem. We've got to keep trying to find a peaceful solution.\n\nAnd let me tell you why I think it's worth continuing the Six-Party process: because the alternative is not a good one. The alternative is an unstable, unpredictable North Korea, potentially with a nuclear weapon, causing chaos in the region. We can't afford that."

We're talking to all parties involved, including Israel, Lebanon, and Hezbollah, to find a solution that addresses the concerns of all sides.\n\nOur goal is to achieve a sustainable cease-fire that will lead to a longer-term resolution of the conflict. We're exploring various options, including a UN Security Council resolution, and we're working hard to get all parties to agree to a framework that will allow for a cessation of violence.\n\nAs for the timeline, it's difficult to predict exactly when we'll see a cessation of violence, but I'm committed to making it happen as soon as possible. We're working around the clock, and we're making progress, but it's a difficult and delicate process.\n\nI want to assure the people of Lebanon and the region that we're committed to finding a peaceful solution that will allow them to live in safety and security.

I did have a chance to talk with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany earlier today, and with Prime Minister Tony Blair from the United Kingdom. We did discuss the matter at hand, regarding President Wolfowitz.\n\nMy advice to Paul is that I think he ought to seriously consider stepping down. I think it would be in the best interest of the World Bank, and the United States publicly supports this notion. The situation at the World Bank, I believe, is ripe for a fresh start, and reform is the agenda that we are all interested in moving forward.\n\nAnd secondly, I've talked to Chancellor Merkel about this matter. And I'll let them speak for themselves, but I think they'll express similar sentiments.

As President of the United States, I'm committed to doing everything we can to help bring peace to the people of Sudan.\n\nWe're working closely with the United Nations, the African Union, and other international partners to deploy additional peacekeepers to the region, and we've already begun to do so. We're also committed to supporting the African Union Mission in Sudan, or AMIS, and we've provided financial and logistical support to help it succeed.\n\nBut more needs to be done. I believe that the international community, including the United Nations, must do more to support the people of Darfur. We need to move forward with the deployment of a hybrid U.N.-A.U. peacekeeping mission, as proposed by the Secretary-General.\n\nI'm also calling on the Sudanese government to cooperate fully with the international community, to allow the peacekeepers to do their job, and to end the violence against the people of Darfur."

But let me tell you, I've talked to our commanders on the ground, I've talked to the Iraqi leaders, and I firmly believe that the surge has given us a window of opportunity to succeed.\n\nNow, I know some folks might say, \"Well, we should just pull out, get out of there, it's not our problem.\" But I think that's a mistaken view. We've got a responsibility to help the Iraqi people build a stable government, a democratic government that can sustain itself, that can defend itself, and that can deny safe haven to terrorists.\n\nNow, I think Senator McCain and I have a lot of areas of agreement when it comes to our Iraq policy. We both believe that we need to show patience, that we need to be persistent, and that we need to give our commanders the flexibility they need to succeed.\n\nNow, I don't think it's productive to get into a lot of hypotheticals about what might happen or what might not happen. What I will say is that I believe our strategy is working. We're seeing some progress on the ground. We're seeing the Iraqi security forces step up and take more responsibility. We're seeing a reduction in violence in some parts of the country. And I think that's a good sign.\n\nBut let me tell you, it's not gonna be easy. It's not gonna be quick. And it's not gonna be without risk. But I firmly believe that the effort is worth it. The American people expect us to succeed, and I'm committed to doing everything in my power to make sure that we do succeed.\n\nSo, I'm not gonna get into a lot of speculative discussion about what might happen or what might not happen.

There's no doubt that Russia has made significant progress in the past decade, especially in terms of economic reforms and their growth. However, there are some disturbing trends that indicate a backsliding on democratic principles.\n\nWhat troubles me most is the restriction of civil liberties, the emergence of a more authoritarian tone from the Kremlin, and the consolidation of power within a smaller circle. These aren't the signs of a healthy democracy. Russia should be a country that cherishes its democratic institutions, but some of the moves they've made, such as the handling of independent media, NGOs, and especially the case of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, raises serious concerns.\n\nNow, I know some folks might say, 'What's the concern here, Mr. President? Why are we worried about this?' And my answer is, I believe that a strong Russia, a Russia that's stable and prosperous, is in our interests. But a Russia that's not democratic, that's not respecting its own citizens' rights, is not going to be a country that we can work with in a truly strategic partnership.\n\nNow, when I sit down with President Putin in a couple of days, I'll be discussing these concerns with him directly. I'll be reiterating our commitment to Russia's integration into the global economy and our hopes for Russia's playing a more constructive role in the world, but I'll also be clear that our friendship and cooperation have to be based on a set of shared values, including respect for democratic principles and human rights. I expect to have a candid conversation, and I expect us to continue the dialogue that we've had on a range of issues, including non-proliferation and counter-terrorism.\n\nMake no mistake, our relationship with Russia is important, and I'm committed to seeing it flourish.

The enemy we face there is a determined one, and they've been using tactics that are not only violent but also cowardly.\n\nNow, I understand that General Myers made those comments, and I respect his assessment. But I'd also say that while the insurgency might be as strong as it was a year ago, we've made some significant progress. We've got more Iraqis in uniform, we've got more coalition forces on the ground, and we're seeing a steady increase in the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.\n\nNow, as for why we haven't been more successful in limiting the violence, I think it's because this is a tough enemy, and it's a tough fight. We're up against an enemy that's got the backing of some external forces, and they've got a lot of resources at their disposal. We're also fighting in a country that's been traumatized by decades of Saddam Hussein's rule, and it's going to take time to rebuild.\n\nBut I'm confident that we're on the right course. We're adapting our strategy, we're working closely with our coalition partners, and we're making progress. We've got a new Iraqi government in place, and that's a major step forward. We're also seeing the Iraqi people begin to take ownership of their own security, and that's crucial.\n\nNow, I know it's tough, and I know that there are going to be setbacks along the way.

The reason I proposed personal accounts is because I believe it's a way to make sure that younger workers have a more modern retirement system that addresses the realities of today's economy. The current system is based on a 1935 system, and we've had a lot of changes since then.\n\nNow, if Congress were to pass a bill that just shored up the system, but didn't provide personal accounts, I would consider it a partial success. We would have addressed the solvency issue, which is important, but we wouldn't have addressed the issue of providing options for workers. I strongly believe that every worker should have the option of having a personalized account, where they can make decisions about their own retirement savings. That's what I've been advocating for.\n\nNow, I'm a reasonable fellow, and I'm willing to listen and see what the Congress comes up with. But I think it's very important for the American people to understand that this is a moment when we can make some important choices about the future of our retirement system.

We've seen some very positive developments on the ground, and the training and equipping of the Iraqi military is proceeding well.\n\nWith the elimination of Zarqawi, Al-Qaeda's number two in Iraq, it's a significant blow to the terrorist organization. His death will undoubtedly make it more difficult for them to carry out attacks and undermine the government.\n\nNow, regarding the timeline, I think it's a reasonable goal to expect the Iraqis to be able to take more responsibility for their own security in the next 12-18 months. But it's not a hard and fast deadline, it's a goal. We're going to be working closely with the Iraqis to help them build their capabilities, and we'll make adjustments as necessary.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Iraqis are already taking the lead in several provinces, and they're doing a good job.

First of all, we're working closely with OPEC to try to increase production. We've had some mixed signals from OPEC, but we're working hard to persuade them that increasing production will not only help the global economy, but it will also help their own economies.\n\nSecondly, we're working to increase our own domestic production. We're working with Congress to open up new areas for exploration and production, both onshore and offshore. We're also working to streamline our permitting process to allow for more efficient and timely production.\n\nThirdly, we're investing in alternative energy sources, such as nuclear, wind, and solar power. We believe that by reducing our dependence on oil, we can reduce our vulnerability to price shocks.\n\nAnd finally, we're working to improve the efficiency of our transportation sector. We're working to improve the fuel efficiency of our cars and trucks, and we're investing in new technologies that can help us reduce our oil consumption.\n\nNow, I know these are long-term solutions, and I know that in the short term, we've got to deal with the reality of high oil prices. But I'm confident that by working together, we can address this challenge and create a more secure and stable energy future for our country. Thank you."

And I'm here to tell you that our policies are aimed at helping all Americans, not just a certain group of people. We believe in, uh, growth and opportunity for everyone, and I think our tax cuts, for example, have helped people at all income levels.\n\nNow, I will say that we've had an agenda that's focused on making America more competitive in the global economy, and that's benefited businesses of all sizes, not just big businesses. I mean, we've seen, uh, small businesses thrive under our policies, and we're proud of that.\n\nBut I will say this: we're not satisfied with the economy yet. We know that, uh, there are still too many Americans who are struggling to make ends meet, who are worried about their job security, or who are feeling left behind in this fast-changing world. And so, we're committed to continuing to work on policies that are gonna help 'em, whether it's, uh, education, or, uh, healthcare, or, uh, job training.\n\nNow, as for what we can do to, uh, overcome this perception, well, I think we just need to, uh, keep talking about the results of our policies, and, uh, show people how they're working. I mean, we can't, uh, just sit back and, uh, let our critics define us. We've gotta, uh, get out there and, uh, tell the good story of what we're doing. And I think, uh, that if people take a hard look at our record, they'll see that we're, uh, fighting for the little guy, too.\n\nIt's also worth noting that I've, uh, had a pretty good track record as governor of Texas of helping low-income and minority groups. We increased funding for education and healthcare, and, uh, we made sure that, uh, those who were most in need were taken care of. And I believe that record will, uh, speak for itself.\n\nBut I'll, uh, keep trying, and I'll, uh, keep listening, and we'll, uh, keep working to make sure that our policies are benefitting all Americans, not just a select few."

I've made my share of mistakes, and I've had my own share of passions and emotions, that have probably contributed to the problem. But let me tell you, I've also reached out to the other side, to try and find common ground.\n\nI think we've got to get back to the idea that we're all in this together, that we're all Americans, and that we've got a responsibility to work together, to solve the big problems that face our country.

I've expressed my concerns about the recent actions in Russia, the prosecution of a prominent businessman, for example, and the concern about the transparency of the election process.\n\nBut I do believe, I do believe that President Putin is committed to Russia's prosperity and security.

I think we've made some progress, but I'm not going to stand here and say that we've made all the progress that I would have liked. We still have a long way to go.\n\nI am optimistic, I am hopeful that President Putin will take steps to increase transparency, to respect the rule of law, to make sure that the elections are free and fair.

Some Democrats may not agree with our actions in Iraq, or our detainee policies at Guantanamo Bay. We've also differed on issues like taxes and the economy, with Democrats pushing for higher taxes and more government spending, whereas my administration has pushed for tax cuts to stimulate growth.\n\nNow, I'm not gonna change who I am, and I'm not gonna change my policies just to try to find common ground with Democrats. But I do think there's room for us to work together on some common-sense issues, like education reform and Medicare reform.

I am committed to our energy policy, and I am convinced that the decisions we are making, even though they're tough in the short term, will pay off in the long term for America.\n\nAnd I'd also remind the American people that we need to address the root causes of high energy prices \u2013 we're consuming too much oil, we're not conserving enough, and we didn't invest in our infrastructure like we should have in the past.

However, I will admit that our initial focus was on the al-Qaeda network and broader Middle Eastern policy, rather than having a single focus solely on Osama bin Laden.\n\nThat being said, we were taking action to address the threat. I had asked the CIA to revisit the al-Qaeda issue and come up with a comprehensive strategy. I had tasked the Joint Chiefs of Staff to refine the military plans, and I had signed several Presidential Directives to outline our objectives.\n\nThe CIA did, in fact, produce a comprehensive review of our counter-terrorism strategy in December of 2000, just before I took office. And in the Spring of 2001, Condoleezza Rice, my National Security Advisor, was engaged in a policy review that involved multiple agencies. \n\nWe were taking this threat seriously and working on these issues, and I reject the notion that we were doing nothing, or somehow were asleep at the switch. The 9/11 attacks were a wake-up call to America and our allies, but they didn't catch us by surprise. Before 9/11, we had anticipated that al-Qaeda might be planning large-scale attacks.\n\nSo, while the quote that President Clinton gave you might be an oversimplification, I don't accept that we were ignoring the problem. We took the threat seriously and were actively working on a comprehensive strategy."

He's a good man, a capable man, and he's been doing a fine job leading the Defense Department, particularly as we work to bring terrorists to justice and make America more secure.\n\nNow, I know there's been some speculation about the timing of my announcement, but the truth is we're in the middle of a war, and I don't think it's the right time to be making changes in the Defense Department. We need to stay focused on the mission, and Secretary Rumsfeld is the right man to lead that effort.\n\nI made the decision about Secretary Rumsfeld's future some time ago, and I chose to announce it when I did because it's the right time for the American people to know that we're going to stay the course and that we're committed to winning this war on terror. The election results didn't play a role in that decision, except in this sense: the American people have reaffirmed our strategy in the war on terror, and I think that's a good thing.\n\nSo, to summarize: I've got confidence in Secretary Rumsfeld, I think he's doing a fine job, and I think the American people agree with the direction we're headed."

First of all, let me just say that the situation with Iran is very serious, and we can't just ignore the fact that they're enriching uranium, which could lead to them developing a nuclear weapon. The threat of a nuclear Iran is a threat to the United States, it's a threat to our allies, and it's a threat to the entire world.\n\nNow, when it comes to oil prices, I'm just as concerned as the American people are. We're in a tight spot, no question about it. But I don't think that our strong stance against Iran's nuclear program is the primary driver of oil prices. Global demand for oil is up, there are other factors at play here, and speculation is playing a role in the price of oil.\n\nThat being said, we are taking steps to address our energy situation. We're working to increase our domestic production, investing in alternative energy sources, and we're also working with our international partners to stabilize the global energy markets. We're doing everything we can to make sure that our economy remains strong, even in the face of these high oil prices.\n\nBut let me make one thing clear: we will not sacrifice our national security on the altar of oil prices. We will not back down from our commitment to preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. That's a non-negotiable."

The United States has a unique position in the world, and we have a responsibility to lead.

We've had disagreements on Kyoto, we've had disagreements on the International Criminal Court, we've had disagreements on Iraq. But I think what people need to understand is that we're not arrogant, we're confident. And there's a difference.\n\nWe're confident in our values. We believe that freedom is a universal value that applies to every human being. We're confident in our system of government. We believe that democracy is the best way to bring hope and peace to people.\n\nNow, I think it's also important to recognize that when we work with our allies, it doesn't mean that we always have to agree. We have tough, honest discussions with our allies, and sometimes those discussions lead to disagreements. But that doesn't mean that we're not committed to our friendships.\n\nAnd as for the danger of going it alone, I'd say that the United States will do what's necessary to protect our national interests. We will not let the interests of terrorists and tyrants push us around. We'll work with our allies, but we'll also make decisions based on what we think is right for America.\n\nI think the danger is, is when countries who oppose us try to label us as isolated. It's a partisan argument, it's a argument that some countries use to try to undermine our leadership. And I don't think it's accurate, and I don't think it's fair."

We're seeing democratic governments take hold, we're seeing economic growth, and we're seeing a renewed sense of hope and optimism among the people of this great continent.\n\nAnd I think it's in our interest to support that progress, to help build on that momentum. And that's why we've made Africa a priority in our foreign policy, particularly in my second term as President.\n\nI'm proud of what we've accomplished through initiatives like the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which has helped to bring anti-retroviral treatment to millions of people across the continent who are living with HIV/AIDS.\n\nWe've also made significant investments in education, in healthcare, and in economic development, through programs like the Millennium Challenge Account and the African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n\nSo, it's not just a question of, \"Why now?\" It's a question of, \"Why not?\" Why not support the people of Africa as they work to build a brighter future for themselves and their children?\n\nAnd I believe that by investing in Africa's development, we're not only doing something that's morally right, we're also doing something that's in the national interest of the United States.\n\nBecause when Africa is stable, when Africa is prosperous, when Africa is democratic, it's good for the American people. It's good for our economy, it's good for our security, and it's good for our values.\n\nSo, that's why Africa is important, and that's why Tanzania is important.

While we had our differences, he was a significant figure in the peace process, and I recognize the impact of his death on the region.\n\nRegarding your question, I firmly believe that the Roadmap for Peace, which was agreed upon by both Israel and the Palestinians, remains the best path forward for a lasting and comprehensive peace. Now, I know there are many challenges ahead, but I still hold out hope that both parties can come together and make progress.\n\nRegarding settlements, I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I believe that Israel's expansion of settlements in the West Bank can be an obstacle to peace. I think it's essential for Israel to exercise restraint and diminish the growth of these settlements, especially as we move forward with the peace process. However, I also understand the legitimate security concerns of the Israeli people, and I believe that these concerns need to be taken into account as well.\n\nThe Palestinians also have a critical role to play in reviving peace negotiations. They must demonstrate a commitment to responsible governance, and to taking the necessary steps to prevent terrorism, which is a major concern for Israel. We cannot expect Israel to move forward in the peace process if it doesn't feel secure.\n\nI want to emphasize that I believe Abu Mazen, the new Palestinian leader, is a man of peace. I look forward to working with him and supporting his efforts to lead his people towards peace.\n\nUltimately, peace in the Middle East requires cooperation, mutual trust, and a willingness to make compromises.

While it's true that we have concerns about Iran's intentions, we have also reiterated our support for Iran's right to a civilian nuclear program, as long as it's done in accordance with international law and safeguard agreements.\n\nThe key difference between Iran and North Korea is this: Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and we're pressing them to meet their obligations under that treaty. We're willing to work with the international community to ensure that Iran's program is peaceful, and we're pushing for greater transparency and cooperation.\n\nNorth Korea, on the other hand, has withdrawn from the NPT and has made it clear that they're pursuing a nuclear weapons program. That's a major difference in our approach. We've made it clear that we're willing to work with North Korea to address their concerns and to provide economic and energy assistance, but we need to see concrete steps towards dismantling their nuclear program.\n\nIn the case of Iran, we're seeking a diplomatic solution that will allow them to have a peaceful nuclear program, but we're also very clear about the need for transparency and cooperation.

And Syria, as you know, has been a transit point for insurgent activity into Iraq. So, I'm not sure that engaging with them directly would necessarily get us the kind of cooperation we need.\n\nNow, that being said, we do have diplomats who talk to Syria and Iran, but I'm not sure that having a big, high-level meeting with their leaders would be productive. I think it's more important to continue to put pressure on them to cooperate, and to make it clear that we expect them to be a part of the solution, not a part of the problem.\n\nWe've got to keep in mind that the region is changing, and we're seeing a lot of variables in play.

We're investing in clean energy technologies, like nuclear power, wind power, and solar power, to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and reduce our emissions.\n\nAnother important goal is to improve America's fuel economy. We've set new fuel economy standards for SUVs and light trucks, which will save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce emissions.\n\nWe've also signed a number of executive orders to reduce our own federal government's environmental footprint. For example, we've set a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from federal buildings and operations by 30 percent by 2010.\n\nNow, I want to emphasize that sustainability's not just about the federal government; it's about personal responsibility, it's about the choices we make in our daily lives. It's about the consumer choosing products that are environmentally friendly. It's about corporate America recognizing that good environmental practices are good business practices.\n\nSo, my goal is to leave America with a cleaner environment, a stronger economy, and a healthy and sustainable way of life for our children and grandchildren. That's what sustainability means to me."

The latest attempt on President Karzai's life is a grim reminder of the dangers that still exist in that country. But I'm pleased to report that our efforts to stabilize and secure Afghanistan are making progress.\n\nWe've had significant successes in disrupting and dismantling al-Qaeda's operations, and the Taliban's grip on the country is loosening. The Afghan people are beginning to see the benefits of a more stable and secure society, with improved economic opportunities, better healthcare, and greater access to education.\n\nNow, I know that the insurgency is still a threat, and we're taking that threat very seriously. Our military, along with our coalition partners, is working closely with the Afghan security forces to root out the Taliban and other extremist groups. We're making progress, but it's not going to be easy, and it's not going to happen overnight.\n\nI'd say we're winning in Afghanistan, but it's a tough fight, and it's a fight that requires patience and perseverance. We're in this for the long haul, and we're committed to seeing it through.\n\nBut I want to emphasize that our strategy is not just about military might. We're also working to rebuild and strengthen Afghanistan's institutions, promote economic development, and support the Afghan people as they build a brighter future for themselves.\n\nSo, while there are still challenges ahead, I'm optimistic about the prospects for success in Afghanistan, and I believe we're on the right track."

We're still working hard to get this tax relief plan passed, and we're making good progress. Now, I understand there are some concerns that some senators have expressed, and we're listening to those concerns.\n\nAs for cutting the size of the plan, I'll tell you this: we've already compromised quite a bit to get this plan where it is today. We think it's a good plan, it's a plan that will help our economy grow, a plan that will help people who are working hard to make ends meet.\n\nNow, I'm a flexible person, I can work with people, and we'll see what we can do to get this plan passed. But what we won't do is sacrifice the principles of the plan. We won't do is abandon the idea of giving American workers a tax cut, because we think that's essential for growth.\n\nSo, we'll work with members of the Senate, we'll listen to their concerns, and we'll see if we can find a way to get this plan passed. But I'm not willing to give up on the core principles of it. We'll keep working, and I'm hopeful that we can get it done.\n\nIt's a big issue, by the way. This is not just about passing a tax cut, it's about the jobs of the American people, it's about the well-being of the American people, and we're gonna keep pushing. Thank you."

We're talkin' about borrowing against the interest that those funds earn. It's a sound financial practice that many companies and governments use, and we believe it's a responsible way to manage our cash flow.\n\nI know some folks might be worried that we're raidin' the cookie jar, but that's just not the case. We're talkin' about a temporary measure to help us bridge a short-term gap, and we're committed to payin' it back with interest.\n\nI'd also like to remind everyone that we've made significant progress in reducin' the deficit since I took office. We've cut taxes, we've reduced spending, and we've taken steps to improve the overall health of our economy.

However, we also recognize that there are limits to our resources, and we must be mindful of the potential risks and consequences of any military intervention.\n\nI don't think that we're stretched too thin at this point. We've got a robust military, and we've got a strong coalition of international partners who share our commitment to promoting peace and stability. But we're always mindful of the need to prioritize our efforts and to focus on those conflicts that pose the greatest threat to our national security and to regional stability.\n\nIt's a careful balancing act, but I'm confident that we've got the right combination of diplomacy, military strength, and international cooperation to meet the challenges that we face."

China's military modernization is a concern for all of us, and we must ensure that any decision to lift the embargo does not inadvertently contribute to an imbalance of power in the region.\n\nFurthermore, we also have concerns about the potential for China to export military technology to rogue states or other countries of concern. This is a critical issue in the global fight against terrorism and proliferation.\n\nNow, I do believe that it's possible to find common ground on this issue. The EU and the United States share many of the same concerns and values, and we have a shared interest in promoting peace and stability in Asia.\n\nIf the EU were to consider lifting the embargo, we would encourage them to do so in a manner that would address our concerns about the potential risks and negative consequences. This might include, for example, the development of a robust and enforceable end-use monitoring regime, to ensure that any arms sales are properly tracked and do not end up in the wrong hands.\n\nUltimately, we must work together to address the challenges we face in Asia and around the world.

As President of the United States, I believe that globalization is a powerful force for good, as it has lifted millions of people out of poverty and created new economic opportunities around the world.\n\nHowever, I also recognize that the process of globalization can be uneven and that some people and communities may be left behind. That's why, as G-8 leaders, we have a responsibility to work together to make sure that the benefits of globalization are shared by all, and that we address the legitimate concerns of those who feel that the process is unfairly affecting them.\n\nIn this regard, I was pleased that the G-8 leaders were able to come together in Genoa to reaffirm our commitment to promoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth, and to addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality.\n\nWe also took important steps to address issues such as debt relief for developing countries, HIV/AIDS, and the environment, which are all critical to the future of the G-8 and the global community.\n\nSo, while the protests and demonstrations in Genoa were certainly a distraction, I believe that they also served as a reminder of the importance of the work that we do in the G-8, and the need for us to stay focused on the big picture - building a more prosperous, more just, and more peaceful world for all.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that we've solved all the problems, but I do believe that the Genoa summit was a step in the right direction. And I think it's worth noting that opposition is something that America was founded upon, and we respect people's right to express themselves, as long as it's peacefully done."

If the UN is unable to act decisively in the face of a threat like Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq, then we will not hesitate to take action with a coalition of like-minded nations.\n\nNow, I want to emphasize that we are working closely with our friends and allies, including those on the UN Security Council, to build support for a resolution that ensures accountability and enforcement of the disarmament obligations that Iraq has agreed to. But at the same time, we cannot allow a lack of agreement at the UN to tie our hands or limit our ability to protect our country and advance the cause of peace and stability in the region.\n\nWe are not defiant of the UN; we are committed to the principles of the UN Charter and the rule of law. However, we will not be deterred from taking necessary action to defend our interests and values."

Our military took action based on that intelligence, and I'm proud of the way they performed.\n\nRegarding Saddam Hussein's status, I'm not at liberty to disclose any information about whether he was at the site or not. We're still gathering information, and we'll release it when it's confirmed.\n\nAs for the war being nearly over, I'd say we're making good progress, but we still have work to do. We're making strides in Baghdad, and the Iraqi people are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel. But we can't let our guard down. We must remain vigilant and continue to work towards our objectives.\n\nWe will continue to work with the Iraqi people, with our coalition partners, and with our military to bring about a peaceful and free Iraq. And when we succeed, and I have no doubt that we will, it'll be a major victory for the Iraqi people, for the Middle East, and for the United States of America.\n\nSo, thank you for your question, and we'll keep you updated as more information becomes available."

We launched a thorough investigation, which is ongoing, and we're working closely with Secretary Rumsfeld and the Department of Defense to get to the bottom of this.\n\nYesterday, I spoke with Secretary Rumsfeld and expressed my strong disappointment and concern about the mistreatment of prisoners. I made it clear that we will not tolerate such behavior, and that we expect our military personnel to uphold the highest standards of conduct. I instructed Secretary Rumsfeld to take all necessary steps to ensure that those responsible are held accountable and that we move quickly to implement reforms to prevent such incidents from happening again in the future.\n\nLet me be clear: the actions of a few do not reflect the values of the United States of America. We are a nation that values human dignity, human rights, and the rule of law. And we will not rest until we have restored the honor and the integrity of our military and our nation."

Now, I know some folks might say, \"Well, why aren't you doing more yourself?\" And my answer is, we are doing a lot ourselves. We've got a robust military effort underway in Afghanistan to root out the Taliban and al-Qaeda, we're working with our law enforcement agencies to prevent attacks here at home, and we're providing significant financial and diplomatic support to countries that are on the front lines in this fight.\n\nNow, I'll be the first to admit that we can always do more, and I'm open to ideas and suggestions on how to deepen our commitment and broaden the coalition. But I'd say to you that we are not being shy about our efforts, and we're not asking others to do something we're not willing to do ourselves.\n\nAnd by the way, it's not just about what we're asking of others, it's also about what we're delivering to others. We're providing critical support to countries like Pakistan, which is a key partner in this fight. We're providing significant humanitarian aid to the people of Afghanistan, who have been affected by the conflict.

Let me be very clear: we are constantly reassessing our military strategy in Iraq, and that includes looking at our troop levels. But let me tell you, any decision to draw down troops will be based on conditions on the ground, not on artificial timelines.\n\nNow, I'm aware that some of our military leaders have spoken about the possibility of drawing down troops in the spring, and I appreciate their candor. However, let me be clear: they were speaking about a hypothetical scenario based on certain conditions being met, not about any definitive plan.\n\nMake no mistake, our policy in Iraq is to succeed, and we will not make decisions based on political considerations or pressure from Washington. We will make decisions based on the recommendations of our military commanders and the situation on the ground. And if that means we need to adjust our troop levels, we will do so. But we will not compromise our mission or our goals in Iraq for the sake of a headline or a deadline.\n\nSo, to answer your question, those military leaders were not out of line. They were simply engaging in a hypothetical discussion based on possible scenarios. But let me assure you, the decisions will be made by me, in consultation with our military leaders and our national security team, and they will be based on one thing: the safety and security of the American people and our troops in Iraq."

Now, I'll tell you this: I don't have any fears about releasing photographs. However, I think it's essential to consider the context in which these photos were taken.\n\nAs the President, I've taken countless photos with numerous people, including supporters, politicians, and individuals from various backgrounds. If we were to release every single photograph of me with every individual I've met, it would set an unprecedented precedent, and that might cause unnecessary disruptions and create undue attention towards specific individuals who are simply supporters or acquaintances.\n\nRegarding Jack Abramoff specifically, I'd like to remind everyone that he was convicted of several crimes, and I strongly condemn his actions. Nevertheless, I think releasing photographs of him and me, taken at events, fundraising receptions, or other public gatherings, would do little to address the more significant issues surrounding his wrongdoings.\n\nTo address the main concern: my administration is cooperative and open with investigations into Jack Abramoff's wrongdoings. I've directed my staff to be as transparent as possible while cooperating fully with those who are conducting the investigations.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, while I don't fear releasing photographs, I believe our administration should maintain a careful balance between the need to fully cooperate with ongoing investigations and avoiding setting precedents that may be distracting or distort the more significant issues at hand. Thank you."

We're working closely with our allies to increase the pressure on the Iranians to make the right decision.\n\nOne thing that is certain is that we will not tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran. That's a genuine threat to global peace, and we will work to prevent that from happening. There are more steps that can be taken, and we're exploring all options.\n\nWe will continue to work with the United Nations, and we will continue to work with our allies to send a very clear message to the Iranian government: 'You're isolating yourself, you're making a choice that's not in the best interest of your people.'\"\n\nWe will hopefully see a change of heart, but if we don't, we'll have to consider other measures to achieve our goal."

It was a proud moment for our troops and for the people of Iraq. And while the situation is complex and challenging today, I remain optimistic that our strategy can work.\n\nWe're adapting to the changing circumstances on the ground, and we're working closely with our Iraqi partners to build a secure and stable Iraq.

We had evidence, intelligence that suggested that Saddam Hussein had the capacity to produce weapons of mass destruction, and that he was a threat not just to the region, but to our own country.\n\nNow, you can second-guess it all you want, and I understand that. But the truth is, we made the best decision we could with the information we had at the time. And I still believe it was the right decision.\n\nRegarding the consequences of leaving, I'd say that we've made a commitment to the people of Iraq, to their government, to help them build a stable democracy. And if we were to leave prematurely, I believe there would be chaos, violence, and a totalitarian regime would emerge. And I don't think that's in the best interest of our country or the world.\n\nSo, it's a tough decision, and I'm not saying it's popular.

They've been designated as such by our government and by the international community.\n\nAs for former President Carter's decision to meet with Hamas leaders, I think it undermines our policy and the efforts of our allies in the region who are working towards a peaceful resolution to the conflict. When you negotiate with a terrorist organization, it gives them legitimacy. It gives them a platform to speak from. And it can create confusion among our friends and allies about where we stand.\n\nWe need to stand strong against terrorism, and we need to stand strong with our allies who are working towards peace in the region. And I think President Carter's actions were unhelpful in that regard.\n\nNow, I understand that President Carter has a right to his own opinion, and he has a right to express it. But I also believe that he should respect the policies of the current administration, especially when it comes to dealing with terrorist organizations. We can't afford to send mixed signals, and we can't afford to give terrorists a platform to spread their hate and their violence.\n\nWe need a clear and consistent policy, and that's what we've been pursuing. We're working with our allies in the region to bring peace and stability to the Middle East, and we're going to continue to do so, no matter what."

And I think it's our responsibility, both at the federal and state level, to ensure that it's applied fairly.\n\nFirst and foremost, it's essential to have a strong and independent judiciary, where judges are confirmed based on their qualifications, not ideology. And that's what I've tried to do throughout my time in office, to appoint judges who will interpret the law, not make it.\n\nSecondly, it's crucial to provide adequate funding for our public defender system, so that those who are facing the ultimate penalty have access to the best possible representation. Now, I know that this is a challenging issue, but it's one we can't afford to ignore.\n\nAdditionally, I believe we need to address the issue of racial disparity in the application of the death penalty. It's something that's been studied and documented, and it's something we need to work on. We need to ensure that the system is fair, and that justice is blind to racial and socio-economic factors.\n\nNow, I've also asked the Department of Justice to review our federal death penalty procedures, to ensure that they're fair and consistent with our values. We must always remember that the death penalty is the ultimate penalty, and we must be 100% certain that justice is being served, and that the system is fair.\n\nAnd finally, I want to emphasize the importance of criminal justice reform at the state level. We need to work with governors and state legislatures to implement reforms that will ensure fairness and accountability in our justice system.\n\nIt's a tough issue, but I believe with a combination of these efforts, we can make progress, and make sure that justice is served in the United States of America."

I am confident that the United Nations Security Council will take a tough, firm, and necessary resolution that will hold Iraq accountable for denying the inspectors the ability to do their job. I think it's in the world's interest, it's in the coalition's interest, it's in the interest of freedom and of peace that we work through the Security Council.\n\nNow, I'm a patient man. I believe that we can succeed in the United Nations. We're getting good cooperation from our friends in the coalition. We're sharing intelligence, we're sharing concerns, and I believe we can get a resolution that will speak clearly to Saddam Hussein.\n\nAs for the next step, we're working on a series of diplomatic efforts, supported by the threat of force. I would remind you that the authorization for the use of military force is already in place. However, I believe we can get a resolution that makes it clear that the world stands united, and that if Saddam Hussein does not disarm, is not cooperating with inspectors, that the coalition is prepared to take action.\n\nI want to emphasize that the use of military force is always the last resort, but it is not off the table. It's an option available to us if the need arises. Our preference, however, is for Saddam Hussein to disarm and to allow the inspectors to do their job.\n\nBut let me make it clear that either way, Saddam Hussein will not be allowed to continue to threaten the world with his WMD programs. It is unacceptable to have a nation like Iraq, which is producing biological, chemical, and attempting to produce nuclear weapons. The world is too unstable for him to be allowed to pursue this course. So, whether or not war is inevitable is really up to Saddam Hussein."

We're not just focused on one individual, we're focused on the entire regime. And if we can dismantle the regime, if we can take out the command and control structures, if we can eliminate the ability of Saddam to threaten his people or his neighbors, then I believe we can say that we've been successful.\n\nNow, I'd be happy to catch Saddam, don't get me wrong.

We're taking a careful and deliberate approach, and any decision would be based on the needs of our commanders on the ground and the effectiveness of our overall strategy.\n\nThe justification for any additional troops would be to support our military efforts to disrupt and dismantle the enemy's ability to wage terrorist attacks against our brave men and women in uniform and the Iraqi people. Our goal remains to transfer responsibility for security to the Iraqi forces, and we believe we're making progress in that regard.\n\nAs for the timetable you mentioned, the 12 to 18 months you're referring to is a rough estimate for when we hope to complete the transition process and have Iraqi forces take the lead on security operations.

The Ukrainian people have been through a lot, but they're working hard to build a better future for themselves, and I'm proud to say that America is supporting them every step of the way.\n\nSo, all in all, I'm very pleased with the outcome of this visit, and I believe that we've laid the groundwork for even stronger cooperation between America, Germany, France, and Ukraine in the months and years ahead."

We've worked closely with the Secretary General, and I've worked hard to make sure that we're paying our dues to the United Nations.\n\nNow, I understand that there are some on the Hill who've suggested we should withhold dues, but I think that would be a mistake. First of all, we need the influence of the United Nations to help us deal with conflicts such as the one in Iraq. And, secondly, I believe in paying our dues.\n\nNow, I do think that the United Nations ought to be reformed. I think it can be a more effective organization, and we've been working with the Secretary General to do just that. But I'm not in favor of withholding dues."

Our partnership is crucial in addressing the challenges we face, and I think we can be effective partners in helping to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nNow, I will say that as president of the United States, I have made it clear that the United States is committed to leading the international effort to help find a solution to this conflict. We've been working closely with our European allies on the Quartet on the Middle East (which includes the US, the European Union, Russia, and the United Nations) to help the parties achieve a two-state solution.\n\nThat being said, I do believe that we need to be mindful of our respective roles and responsibilities. The United States has a unique relationship with Israel, and I've made it clear that we will continue to support our friend and ally Israel. At the same time, we're working to strengthen our relationships with the Arab states, and to encourage them to take a more active role in promoting peace and stability in the region.\n\nSo, I think we can be equal partners in the sense that we share a common goal, but I also think it's essential that we be mindful of our respective roles and responsibilities as we work together to promote peace in the Middle East."

My duty as President is to protect and promote the interests of all Americans, not just one group or another. We've worked hard to create an environment that's good for business, because we know that when American businesses are strong, the economy is strong, and that means jobs and opportunities for ordinary Americans.\n\n(squaring his shoulders) Now, I'll admit, we've had some tough decisions to make, and we've taken some steps to make sure our economy's competitive in a changing world. But I believe our policies have been sound, and I believe they're bearing fruit. The economy's grown, jobs have been created, and ordinary Americans are better off today than they were when I took office.\n\nOf course, there's always more work to be done, and we're not satisfied with the progress we've made. But I can tell you, our focus has been on making sure that the benefits of our policies are felt by all Americans, not just a select few. That's why we've worked to cut taxes for everyday Americans, to make sure they've got access to quality healthcare and education, and to keep this country safe and secure.\n\nNow, I know some folks might disagree with our approach, but I've always said, we're not going to get everything right. We're going to make some mistakes. But I can tell you this: we've always put the interests of ordinary Americans first, and we're going to keep doing that for the rest of our time in office."

We're urging calm and restraint, and we're encouraging President Musharraf to adhere to the democratic process.\n\nWhat I would like to see happen is for Pakistan to continue on the path of democratic reform. This includes holding free and fair elections, allowing for the active participation of opposition parties, and ensuring that the rule of law is upheld.\n\nWe've been working closely with the Pakistani government to support their efforts to combat extremism and promote democratic reforms.

We share a common goal of defeating terrorism and extremism, and we'll continue to work together to achieve that goal.\n\nNow, I know that there are many challenges facing Pakistan, and there will be ups and downs along the way.

They've done a good job, and I appreciate their efforts.\n\nIn terms of security, I think it's very important for all nations to contribute in a meaningful way. Whether or not Canada participates with troops is up to the Canadian government to decide. I believe we can find common ground, though, in terms of providing training and assistance to the Iraqi security forces as they develop their capabilities.\n\nIt's going to be a long haul, but I think it's in our national interest, the national interest of both our countries, that we cooperate in this matter. I think it's too early to say exactly how it's all going to shake out, but I appreciate the willingness of Prime Minister Martin to consider contributing in meaningful ways to help the Iraqi people.\n\nNow, I must remind everybody, our goal is to transfer authority and security responsibility to the Iraqis as quickly as possible. That's our strategy, that's our policy. So, to the extent that nations want to contribute, we're open to that. And we'll certainly work with the Canadian government to see how best to take their willingness to help and coordinate it with the international efforts to bring stability to Iraq.\n\nWe've also discussed a precedent for international engagement on security issues for civil police assistance in places like Kosovo, where, as you know, Canada played a significant role. The development of Iraqi security forces, I think, will provide another opportunity for us to work together, not necessarily within the coalition, but through a UN mandate or other mechanisms that can bring international support.\n\nSo, I appreciate Prime Minister Martin's enthusiasm about wanting to contribute. I think it's very important that we work closely to get this mission done."

We're going to be driven by the facts on the ground and by the advice of our military commanders.\n\nThat being said, I am willing to consider new ideas and perspectives, as always. I've asked my national security team to be constantly looking at our strategy and tactics, to see if there are ways we can improve our position. We're constantly adapting, constantly evolving, to meet the changing circumstances on the ground.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, I'm willing to consider new ideas, but I'm not willing to second-guess myself at this point.

We're not just fighting it for the sake of the Iraqis; we're fighting it for the sake of security and freedom here at home and around the world.\n\nSo, we'll continue to evaluate, we'll continue to adapt, and we'll continue to do what's necessary to achieve our objectives."

And the reason I believe that is because a nuclear Iran would be a destabilizing influence in the Middle East.\n\nSecondly, I firmly believe that we have a diplomatic path forward. I'm more optimistic that we can get the Iranians to change their ways. And I'm more optimistic that we can convince the Iranians that we mean what we say. And what we're saying is that we want them to be a non-nuclear nation.\n\nNow, if that doesn't work, then we'll have to work with our allies to consider other options. But I want to lead this world to a place where we don't have to think about using military force. I believe that there's a way to solve this issue without resorting to military confrontation.\n\nAnd as for when I leave office, I hope that the momentum that we've built on this issue continues. The international community is united, by and large, in saying to the Iranians, \"We don't want you to have a nuclear program.\" And I believe that the next President of the United States will have a very strong foundation to build upon."

This program has been quite successful in helping the Russians secure and dismantle their weapons of mass destruction, and we believe it's in our national security interest to continue to support these efforts.\n\nHowever, we're also concerned about the recent actions of the Russian government, particularly in terms of their handling of the media, their treatment of Mr. Khodorkovsky, and other issues that raise questions about the democratic development of Russia. As a result, we are reviewing all of our assistance programs to Russia to make sure that they are consistent with our values and our national security interests.\n\nI want to emphasize that our goal is to work cooperatively with the Russian government to address the threats we face from the spread of WMD, but we also expect the Russian government to live up to its commitments to democratic values and human rights. We're not making any decisions on reductions in assistance at this point, but we are looking very carefully at the relationship and considering all of our options.\n\nIt's a delicate balance, but we're committed to pursuing our national security interests while also promoting democratic values and practices around the world."

We believe that by moving forward with this resolution now, we can build on the momentum from the recent Palestinian elections and the progress that we've made on the ground in areas such as economic development and security.\n\nIt's also clear that time is of the essence. The roadmap has been in place for several years, and it's time to build on the progress we've made and push towards a negotiated two-state solution.\n\nWe believe that this resolution will send a clear message to the parties that it's time to move forward, to make the necessary compromises, and to demonstrate a commitment to peace.\n\nMake no mistake, this will require sacrifices from both sides.

We've been clear that this is a serious offer, and we're not going to engage in endless negotiations without some sense of urgency and seriousness on the part of the Iranians.\n\nNow, as for the timeline, we're still working with our partners in the EU-3 - France, Germany, and the UK - to determine the best course of action. We're not going to put a specific timeline on it, but I will say that patience is wearing thin. We've been at this for a while now, and we need to see some movement.\n\nIf the Iranians continue to reject our offer, we'll have to start thinking about other options, including, of course, going to the Security Council. We're not ruling anything out, and we're working closely with our partners to ensure that we're presenting a united front.\n\nLet me be clear: we will not back down on the issue of enrichment and reprocessing.

We've seen their active efforts to destabilize the situation in Iraq, and I've made it clear that any conversations we have with them will need to be aimed at getting them to stop doing that. I'm willing to listen to what they have to say, but I'm not willing to legitimize their behavior or to make concessions to them just for the sake of talking.\n\nI am sending our Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, to the meeting, and she'll be able to engage in conversations with her counterparts from Iran and Syria, if they choose to attend.

One concrete measure we're taking is to support the work of the World Food Programme and other humanitarian organizations to deliver emergency food aid to those in need.\n\nRegarding biofuel policy, I believe it's essential to consider the unintended consequences of certain policies. While biofuels are an important component of our effort to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, I think we need to have a more nuanced approach to this issue.\n\nOur biofuel policies must be carefully balanced to ensure that they do not inadvertently drive up food prices or lead to food shortages. In the United States, for example, we're exploring ways to diversify our biofuel production, including investing in research and development of second-generation biofuels that can be produced from non-food sources, such as agricultural waste and switchgrass.\n\nWe're also working with our international partners to promote a more sustainable approach to biofuel production, one that takes into account the need to ensure global food security while also addressing the urgent challenge of climate change."

(pauses) Italy, our great ally, has indeed been a vital partner in our efforts to combat terrorism and promote global security. Prime Minister Berlusconi and I have had many discussions on these issues, and I must say, we share a strong commitment to the principles of freedom and democracy.\n\nNow, specifically regarding our cooperation with Italy, I'd say that they've been a valued member of the coalition in Afghanistan and Iraq. Their troops have played a key role in the stabilization efforts, particularly in the southern region of Iraq. (pauses) We appreciate their courage and sacrifice, just as we do with all our coalition partners.\n\nIn addition, Italy has been a strong supporter of our efforts to counter terrorism, not only in the Middle East but also in the Balkans and elsewhere. Their intelligence services have been helpful in sharing information and coordinating our counter-terrorism efforts.\n\nSo, in short, Italy has been a stalwart ally, and we value our partnership with Prime Minister Berlusconi and the Italian people."

Let me make one thing very clear: the United States and our allies are working closely together to address the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. We are exploring all options to achieve our goal of disarmament and I talked to President Chirac the other day. \n\nAs for the idea that we were proposing that NATO as an organization intervene directly in Iraq, I reject that notion. What the Secretary-General of NATO and I have discussed is not intervention but making a commitment to defend Turkey should it be attacked, providing Franco-British U.S. capabilities which would make the life of any combatant much more uncomfortable.\n\nWe are working together, and I believe that we are making good progress in our conversations. There are some differences, no question about it. But we are working through these differences, and I'm very confident that we can find common ground."

It's the beginning of a new era for that country. It's a transfer of sovereignty from the Coalition Provisional Authority to the Iraqi people, and it's a major step towards Iraq taking control of its own destiny.\n\nIn terms of an exit strategy, I've said all along that we'll leave Iraq when the job is done. And the job is to help the Iraqis build a stable, secure, and free society. We'll continue to work with the Iraqi government to ensure that they have the capability to defend themselves and their government.\n\nNow, as for Zarqawi, he's a significant threat, there's no question about it. He's a terrorist, an al-Qaeda affiliate, who is trying to drive a wedge between the people of Iraq and the new government. But I'm confident that the Iraqi government, with the help of coalition forces, will ultimately defeat him. We'll continue to work to bring him to justice, and we won't be intimidated by his tactics.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Iraqi people are making a choice. They're choosing a path of freedom, a path of democracy, and a path of peace. And Zarqawi and his associates are trying to disrupt that. But I'm confident that the Iraqi people will remain committed to this course, and we'll continue to support them every step of the way."

He was a powerful voice for justice and compassion, and his message of hope and forgiveness has inspired countless Americans. His commitment to the principles of human dignity and the value of every human life has been a source of guidance for me and for many Americans.\n\nNow, regarding his opposition to the war in Iraq, I will say that I respect the Pope's moral authority and his voice in the international community. While we didn't agree on the decision to go to war, I took his concerns seriously and gave them due consideration.\n\nHowever, as President, I also had a duty to protect the American people and to make decisions based on the best information available to me at the time. I believed that Saddam Hussein's regime posed a threat to our national security, and that it was essential to take action to protect the United States and the world from that threat.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Pope and I didn't always see eye-to-eye on this issue, but we did share a deep commitment to human dignity and to the importance of promoting peace and understanding in the world. I valued his counsel, even when we disagreed, and I will always respect his legacy as a champion of justice and compassion."

    "gen_response": "The issue of carried interest. Well, I think this is a matter that's been debated in Washington for a long time. As I see it, carried interest is a key component of the way that private equity and venture capital firms operate, and we need to be careful about how we approach it.\n\nI believe that taxing carried interest at capital gains rates is fair, because it's a form of compensation that's tied to the performance of the investments that these firms are making. It's not a salary or a wage; it's a return on investment, and it's treated that way for tax purposes.\n\nNow, I know that some folks might say, \"Well, wait a minute, this is just a way for wealthy investors to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.\" And I understand that concern. But the fact is, carried interest is a key part of the way that these firms are incentivized to take risks and make investments in companies that might not otherwise get funding.\n\nThat being said, I'm open to having a conversation about how we can ensure that our tax code is fair and equitable. If there are ways to make sure that wealthy investors are paying their fair share, I'm happy to listen to those ideas. But I think we need to be careful about how we approach this issue, because we don't want to inadvertently harm the ability of private equity and venture capital firms to make investments in companies that are creating jobs and driving economic growth."

And I believe that foreign investment can be beneficial, as long as it's done in a way that doesn't compromise our national security or the integrity of our financial markets.\n\nNow, I've been assured by our Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, that the investments we're talking about \u2013 from sovereign wealth funds \u2013 are subject to the same scrutiny as any other investor. And I've been told that these investments are in the form of minority stakes, not controlling interests.\n\nBut I do think it's prudent that we take a careful look at this issue, to make sure that our institutions, our financial markets, and our national security are protected. We need to make sure that we maintain transparency and adhere to our core principles of free market capitalism.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I do have some concerns, but I also believe that we can benefit from responsible foreign investment, as long as we proceed with caution and a careful eye on our national interests.

They'll also be someone who understands the importance of upholding the highest standards of ethics and professionalism within the agency. \n\nNow, I'd like to emphasize that the ongoing controversies will not deter me from finding the right person for the job.

First of all, I think the Secretary-General spoke for himself, and I think it's very important for us to speak for ourselves. The United States, of course, supports the goal of a Palestinian state that is viable and peaceful. But we must also recognize the facts on the ground, and the fact is that Israel is a democratic country that is trying to defend its people.\n\nNow, in terms of the situation on the ground, I think Secretary Powell and General Zinni are on their way to the region, and they will be working to try to calm the situation. We are working very closely with all parties to try to bring an end to the violence and to get talks started again. But I think we need to be clear that the terrorist activities of groups like Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad are activities that we cannot tolerate, and they must be dealt with.\n\nAs for the Israeli operation, I think it's very important for us to respect Israel's right to self-defense. We also think it's very important for Israel to be mindful of the potential consequences of its actions, and to work with us to try to bring about a peaceful resolution to this conflict.\n\nIn terms of General Zinni's mission, I'm confident that he will be able to work effectively with all parties to try to bring about a peaceful resolution. He's a man of great experience and great integrity, and I have every confidence in him.\n\nBut I think we need to be realistic about the challenges that we face. The situation on the ground is very difficult, and it's going to take a lot of work and a lot of effort to bring about a peaceful resolution. But we're committed to trying, and we're committed to working with all parties to try to bring about a better future for the people of the region."

I think that's an important distinction to make. There are many Palestinians who do want peace, who do want to live in a safe and secure and prosperous society, just like the Israelis do. And I think the Prime Minister is committed to helping those folks.\n\nBut at the same time, I also understand that the Prime Minister has a responsibility to protect his people, and I agree with him that Hamas is a terrorist organization that's responsible for the harm and the suffering of not only Israelis, but also Palestinians. And I think that's a problem that needs to be addressed in any peace negotiations.\n\nNow, I'm optimistic that we can make progress on the peace process. I think we've made some progress since the meeting in Aqaba. I think the roadmap is a good starting point, and I'm hopeful that the next few months will show some \u2013 will show some significant movement towards peace. But it's going to require the leadership of both the Palestinians and the Israelis to be willing to take risks for peace, and to make sure that we have a partner in peace that's committed to the same principles that we are: democracy, freedom, tolerance, and security."

It's not just about the amount of money or the number of troops; it's about the coalition that's building.

Every contribution, no matter how small, counts and is a testament to the international will to stand against tyranny and support democracy.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a multinational effort, and we will continue to work with our coalition partners to ensure that Iraq has the support it needs to transition to a stable democracy.

We're shifting our focus towards building a more robust counterinsurgency effort, one that involves not just our military, but also our diplomats and other agencies.\n\nNow, I still believe that Secretary Rumsfeld was right to emphasize the importance of technological advancements and agility in our military. But, as the situation in Iraq evolved, it's become clear that we need to balance that agility with the reality on the ground.\n\nWe need to have the necessary troops and equipment to secure the population and support our allies, and we're working to adjust our approach accordingly.

The UN resolutions provide a framework for a negotiated settlement, and it's in the interest of both Israelis and Palestinians to work together towards a two-state solution.\n\nNow, I know that the road ahead won't be easy. There are many challenges to overcome, and both sides have legitimate concerns.

That's not our intention. We believe in a balance of power among the branches of government.\n\nHowever, in a post-9/11 world, we face unprecedented threats and challenges. As Commander-in-Chief, I have a responsibility to protect the American people, and I believe that requires a certain level of executive authority.\n\nNow, I'm willing to work with Congress to find common ground and to ensure that we're not overstepping our bounds. But I also believe that the Constitution gives the President certain inherent powers, particularly when it comes to national security.\n\nSo, to answer your question, we're not trying to \"recalibrate\" the balance of power, per se.

I believe strongly that both Priscilla Owen and Charles Pickering would be outstanding judges, and I will continue to work with the Senate to see that they get the fair consideration they deserve.\n\nAnd I might add that we need to take steps to prevent gridlock in the Senate. It's the responsibility of the Senate to give an up-or-down vote on judicial nominees who have been nominated by the President.

The Supreme Court, of course, is a very high-profile institution, and people have strong feelings on both sides of the aisle about who should sit on the Court.\n\nI won't speculate on any particular nomination, but I will tell you that I have a commitment to nominate highly qualified judges who will interpret the law, not make law. I believe that's a fundamental difference between some of my, shall we say, critics and me.\n\nBut I'm confident that we'll be able to find a highly qualified nominee, and yes, it's likely to be a contentious process, but I'm ready to take on that challenge, because I believe we can find highly qualified people who can serve with distinction on the Supreme Court.\n\nThank you for that question."

We consider Estonia to be one of our closest friends in the Baltic region, and we've worked closely together on a range of issues, from counter-terrorism to non-proliferation to promoting economic development.\n\nIn terms of our overall foreign policy priorities, I'd say that our relationship with Estonia is definitely in the top 20, and probably in the top 15.

I want to assure the American people that we've learned a great deal from the response to Hurricane Katrina, and we're workin' hard to make sure that we're prepared for any situation that may arise.\n\nFirst, let me say that Katrina was a catastrophic event, unlike any other in our nation's history. The storm's destruction was widespread, and the levee breaches were a shock to all of us. But in the aftermath, we've taken significant steps to improve our preparedness and response capabilities.\n\nWe've invested heavily in improving our emergency management systems, including the creation of the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act. This legislation has helped us to strengthen our ability to respond to disasters, and to provide better support to affected communities.\n\nWe've also taken steps to improve our critical infrastructure, including the repair and reinforcement of levees along the Gulf Coast. And we've worked closely with state and local officials to ensure that they have the resources they need to prepare for and respond to disasters.\n\nRegarding the terrorist threat, let me be clear: we're deeply concerned about the threat posed by al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. We're workin' hard to stay one step ahead of these groups, and to disrupt their plans.\n\nWe've made significant progress in disrupting al-Qaeda's leadership and operational capabilities, but we know that this threat is constantly evolving. That's why we remain vigilant, and we're takin' steps to enhance our counter-terrorism capabilities, including the creation of the National Counterterrorism Center.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I want to assure the American people that we're workin' hard to prepare for any eventuality, whether it's a natural disaster or a terrorist attack. We're committed to doin' everything in our power to protect our citizens and our nation."

But I do believe that the recent election results in Palestine demand a careful and thoughtful response from the international community.\n\nAs for dealing with the Palestinians, I've made it very clear that we cannot deal with a party that advocates the destruction of Israel and holds terrorist views. Hamas must take concrete steps toward peace: disarm, reject terror, and respect Israel's right to exist. If Hamas is unwilling to meet these basic conditions, it's hard to see how a political dialogue can be productive.\n\nWe'll continue to work closely with our international partners to find a peaceful solution to this conflict. We'll also ensure that US foreign assistance to the Palestinian people is channeled through mechanisms that do not benefit Hamas or any other organization that advocates terrorism.\n\nNow, I want to emphasize that we'll continue to seek a negotiated settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But it's the Palestinian leadership's responsibility to demonstrate its commitment to a peaceful resolution of this conflict. And that means rejecting terror, recognizing Israel's right to exist, and taking real steps towards democratic reform."

As you know, the United States has provided significant support to the Palestinian people, and we'll continue to do so. However, I've made it clear that our aid is not just based on support for the Palestinian people, but also based on a commitment to a peaceful, two-state solution. And it's going to be very difficult to work with Hamas unless they accept certain principles.\n\nWe expect any organization that wants to be a partner in the peace process to renounce terrorism, recognize Israel's right to exist, and accept the existing agreements between the parties. If Hamas is part of a government that makes that commitment, then we'll have to consider how we might work with them. But we'll not provide support to a Hamas-led government that does not accept the principles of peace.\n\nNow, we're in tight consultations with our international partners and allies on this matter. I look forward to discussing this further with European leaders, as well as with leaders in the region. We'll be watching very closely how this develops, and we're committed to supporting the Palestinian people as they work towards a future of peace and opportunity."

We were confident, based on the intelligence that we had, that Saddam Hussein possessed those weapons. Not finding them, of course, was a major disappointment.\n\nAnother misstep that I would point to is our underestimation of the insurgency. We expected the war to move quickly and the Iraqi people to welcome our presence. But what we didn't anticipate was the rise of al-Qaeda in Iraq and other insurgent groups that made the post-war period much more difficult.\n\nAnd as for myself, I think one of my great regrets is the statement I made aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln, when I said \"Mission Accomplished.\" We hadn't yet completed our work, and while we had achieved a great deal, that statement was a bit premature.\n\nBut in the end, we remained committed to helping the Iraqi people achieve freedom and democracy, and that, I believe, was the right decision."

She was a real firecracker, that one. She had a wit as sharp as a tack, and she wasn't afraid to use it. I recall one debate we had, she said something about my father being the silver spoon that I was born with... (chuckles) Well, that was a tough moment for me, but I learned from it.\n\nBut in all seriousness, Ann Richards taught me the importance of connecting with the people of Texas. She had a way of speaking to them, of understanding their concerns and their values. And I think that's something that I tried to carry with me throughout my own career in politics.\n\nEven though we disagreed on a lot of issues, I always considered Ann Richards to be a worthy opponent. She was a true Texan, through and through, and I think we both wanted what was best for our state, even if we had different ideas about how to get there.\n\nSo, all in all, I'm grateful for the experience of running against Ann Richards. It was a tough campaign, but it taught me a lot about politics, and about myself."

While it's true that China may not be ready to impose the kinds of sanctions that we would like to see, I believe that we're making progress in convincing them to take a stronger stance against the North Korean regime.\n\nAs for the effectiveness of economic sanctions, I agree that they may have limited effect in the short term. But I believe that over time, sanctions can be a powerful tool in isolating a regime and putting pressure on them to change their behavior. We're committed to exploring all options, including diplomatic and economic measures, to deal with the North Korean threat.\n\nLet me just say that we're not going to take anything off the table at this point.

I'd like to start by saying that education is the key to unlocking the doors of opportunity and understanding, and it's a shared value between Pakistan and the United States.\n\nNow, as for the question of secular schools in Islamic communities in Pakistan, I believe it's a complex issue that requires a thoughtful approach. First of all, I think it's essential for the people of Pakistan to decide what kind of education system is best for their children. We want to support President Musharraf's efforts to promote education and stability in Pakistan, and we believe that a well-educated and informed populace is a powerful tool against extremism.\n\nWhile our countries may have different approaches to education, I think we share the same goal of promoting tolerance, understanding, and a commitment to non-violence. The Bin Laden ideology, the idea of using violence and intimidation to achieve one's goals, is a threat to all free people. And I think the best way to confront that ideology is through the spread of education and the promotion of tolerant and moderate voices.\n\nPresident Musharraf and his government have taken significant steps to promote education and to create a more moderate and tolerant society. And we will continue to support those efforts.\n\nBut ultimately, the form and content of education in Pakistan is a decision for the Pakistani people to make, and we respect that."

Mr. Pollard was convicted of espionage in 1987 and was sentenced to life in prison. While I understand the strong feelings of the Israeli government and many American citizens, including Jewish groups, regarding his case, I must consider the standards and principles of our justice system.\n\nWhile I sympathize with Mr. Pollard's family and supporters, I must take into consideration the severity of his crimes and the harm caused to our national security. However, I have instructed my administration to review the case and consider the possibility of commuting his sentence. \n\nHowever, this should not be linked directly to the Israeli-Palestinian issue, as the fate of Mr. Pollard and the Palestinian prisoners should be determined based on their individual merits, not as part of a bartering process. Our consistent policy in the Middle East has been to advocate for the release of Palestinian prisoners who are no longer deemed a security threat, and the Israeli government must make its own decision regarding this issue.\n\nI hope that clarifies our stance on these two separate matters.

We've been a strong supporter of the Palestinian people, and we've provided significant aid and assistance to help them build a better future.\n\nBut I think it's also important to recognize that Israel has some unique security concerns that we must take seriously. The threat of terrorism, the threat of Iranian aggression, these are real concerns that we must address.\n\nSo, while I understand President Carter's concerns, I believe our policy is a careful balance between our commitment to Israel's security and our commitment to the Palestinian people's aspiration for a better life. And I think we've made progress in the region, and we're going to continue to work towards a two-state solution."

And that intelligence was backed by most of the world's intelligence agencies, including some of our friends and allies.\n\nHowever, as it turned out, that intelligence was not accurate. And I've taken responsibility for the intelligence failures that took place at that time. I've also acknowledged that there were some mistakes that were made in the planning and execution of the Iraq war.\n\nNow, in terms of the advice I got from my advisors, and folks like George Tenet, and Colin Powell, and Condoleezza Rice, and Don Rumsfeld, I think that we were all involved in this decision-making process, and we all had access to the same information.\n\nNow, I will say this, that one of the lessons that I've learned is that the intelligence can be wrong. And when the intelligence is wrong, there are going to be consequences. And so, I think it's essential for the American people to have the confidence in our intelligence agencies to be able to provide us with accurate information, and that we've got to be careful in how we use that information to make decisions.\n\nAnd I think that's an important lesson that we've learned from the Iraq experience."

The current regime in Iran has shown no willingness to reform or to change its ways, and therefore, we must consider all options to bring about a more peaceful and stable future for the Iranian people.\n\nNow, I'm not going to speculate on specific actions that we might take, but I will say that we are working closely with our allies and friends around the world to increase pressure on the Iranian government to change its behavior. We're working through diplomatic channels, through economic means, and through other measures to make it clear to the Iranian government that it's time for a change.\n\nMake no mistake, the Iranian people are the ones who will ultimately decide the future of their country, and we will do everything in our power to support them in their efforts to build a better, more democratic future. But the Iranian government must understand that the United States and the international community will not tolerate their continued support for terrorism, their pursuit of nuclear weapons, and their human rights abuses.\n\nWe're going to continue to work on this issue, and I'm confident that with the resolve and determination of the international community, we can bring about a better future for the Iranian people."

Now, let me be clear, I do not agree with his vision for the hemisphere. His brand of populism and authoritarianism is not the model that we want to see in the Americas. And I think his influence is beginning to decline, in part because of his own policies, and in part because of the growing ties between the people of the United States and the people of Latin America.\n\nWe've had some significant successes in Latin America - the Central American Free Trade Agreement, theFree Trade Areas of the Americas, and the initiative that we announced at the Summit of the Americas to help the poorer countries in our hemisphere. All of these initiatives are designed to promote economic growth, increase trade, and reduce poverty, and I think they're having a positive effect.\n\nNow, I think it's also worth noting that Chavez's influence is limited by his - by the fact that he's a polarizing figure. There are a number of countries in the region that are starting to push back against his influence, and we're working closely with those countries to promote a more positive, more democratic vision for the hemisphere. So, all in all, I think that while Chavez is still a force to be reckoned with, his influence is not as significant as it was a year or two ago."

The six-party talks, which include North and South Korea, the United States, China, Russia, and Japan, have been a positive step forward.

And we will do so in a way that's consistent with our laws and our values.\n\nNow, I think it's also important to note that the Convention Against Torture, which the United States has ratified, makes very clear that no exceptional circumstances, including war, may be invoked to justify torture. And let me be very clear: the United States does not torture. We will interrogate people, and we will do so in a way that's consistent with our values and our laws. Thank you."

So while this information is interesting and it does give us some cause for cautious optimism, we still have concerns about Iran's intentions and actions.\n\nNow, as for whether this will lead to a change in U.S. policy, our policy towards Iran is clear: we want to work towards a diplomatic solution, but at the same time, we're not going to take any military options off the table. We believe that Iran needs to suspend its enrichment activities in order for there to be meaningful talks about its nuclear program.\n\nSo I would say that this NIE has had no effect on our policy, we're still very concerned about Iran's nuclear intentions and still determined to prevent them from acquiring a nuclear weapon."

He's been identified as the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, and we've made it clear that we're committed to capturing or killing him. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: he's a terrorist, and we want him to face justice.\n\nBut I also make it clear that our strategy is broader than just one individual. We're fighting a global war on terror, and we're taking down his network, taking down al-Qaeda, disrupting their operations, and making it harder for them to communicate.\n\nNow, bringing Osama bin Laden to justice is a priority, but it's not the only priority. We've got to stay focused on the larger strategy, which is to disrupt and dismantle the terrorist networks, and that's what we're doing.\n\nI think the American people understand that this is a long-term effort, and we're making progress, and we're going to continue to make progress.

The bombings that took place are a grim reminder of the nature of the enemy we're facing. These terrorists are ruthless, and they're determined to disrupt the progress that's being made in Iraq.\n\nNow, I believe that our coalition partners are committed to the cause. They understand, just like we do, that we're not only fighting for the future of Iraq, but we're fighting for the security of our own countries. We're fighting against a terrorist network that wants to disrupt the peace and stability of the world.\n\nNow, I've spoken to several world leaders since these attacks took place, and I'm heartened by the resolve that I hear in their voices. They understand the stakes, and they understand the importance of standing firm against these terrorists.\n\nNow, I do believe that these attacks will cause some people to consider our resolve, and I think that's natural. But I'm confident that as our partners consider the challenges ahead, they'll also consider the great progress that we've made. We've got a plan in place to transfer power to the Iraqis, and that plan is on schedule.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I don't think these attacks will discourage our coalition partners from contributing troops or manpower. In fact, I think it will remind them of the importance of our mission, and the need for all of us to stand together against this common enemy."

As Commander-in-Chief, I strongly believe that Saddam Hussein's actions leading up to our invasion of Iraq in 2003 warrant consideration of the full scope of his crimes. The invasion of Kuwait in 1990 was a clear demonstration of Saddam's aggressive intentions and blatant disregard for international law.\n\nRegarding the assassination attempt on my father, the 43rd President of the United States, it is essential to acknowledge the gravity of this threat. The fact that Saddam Hussein's intelligence agency was involved in a plot to assassinate a former President of the United States underscores the danger he posed to American lives and global stability.\n\nBy including these examples, the 9/11 Commission or any other investigative body can paint a more comprehensive picture of Saddam's malevolent behavior and his role as a destabilizing force in the region."

We've got to make some smart decisions now to ensure that Social Security remains solvent for future generations.\n\nNow, I've proposed a plan to reform Social Security, which includes voluntary personal accounts. This plan allows workers to take a portion of their payroll taxes and invest it in a personal account that they own and control. This way, workers will have the chance to earn a higher rate of return on their investments, and that will help to make the system more solvent.\n\nI think this is a common-sense approach, and it's one that's worthy of consideration.

But I'm confident that the US-UK relationship is strong, and we'll continue to work closely together on a wide range of issues, including Iraq.\n\nIt's worth noting that Gordon Brown has been the UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer, and we've had a good working relationship on economic issues. I'm optimistic that we can build on that foundation and continue to make progress in Iraq. But as I said, it's too early to speculate on what specific changes might occur."

Regarding the situation in Lebanon, I want to assure the American people and the international community that we are deeply concerned about the situation there. The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah is a serious one, and we are working closely with our allies to try to bring a resolution to this crisis.\n\nAs for speaking with President Assad, I've made it clear that Syria has a role to play in this conflict, and we've been working through diplomatic channels to encourage them to use their influence to help bring an end to the violence. However, I must say that we also have deep concerns about Syria's support for terrorist organizations, including Hezbollah, and we will continue to press them on this issue.\n\nNow, I want to make it clear that we are committed to a ceasefire, but it's got to be a lasting one. We don't want to just see a temporary halt in the violence, only to have it resume again in the future. We need a lasting solution that addresses the root causes of this conflict, and we're working with our international partners to achieve that goal."

However, our budget office is working on projection models and should have those numbers available soon.

As we consider our options in dealing with the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq, I've had productive discussions with Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der of Germany. While we may not see eye to eye on every aspect of this issue, I believe Germany shares our concern about the dangers posed by Saddam's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and his support for terrorism.\n\nAs a key member of the international community and a valued ally, we would hope that Germany would take an active role in supporting our efforts to disarm Iraq through peaceful means. This could involve participation in diplomatic efforts, such as working with us to pass a UN Security Council resolution that makes it clear to Saddam that the international community will not tolerate his attempts to acquire and proliferate WMD.\n\nIf, however, diplomacy fails and military action becomes necessary, we would hope that Germany would be a strong partner in supporting the international community's efforts to enforce UN resolutions and protect our shared interests in the region.\n\nNow, I want to emphasize that we're not expecting Germany, or any other nation for that matter, to commit its military forces to this effort. We understand that each nation has its own unique circumstances, capabilities, and responsibilities. But I do believe that Germany, as a leading member of the international community, has a critical role to play in helping us achieve our shared goals in this region."

But I gotta say, I'm proud of the way the American people have come together to help those in need. We've had our challenges, no question about it. The storm was a wallop, and it's taken a while to get our arms around it.\n\nNow, I think there are a couple of things that I'm disappointed about. One is the effectiveness of the levee systems in New Orleans. We gotta make sure those levees are robust and can withstand the fury of a storm like Katrina. And I'm disappointed that we couldn't have done a better job of anticipating the consequences of a storm like this.\n\nBut I gotta say, I'm also heartened by the resilience of the American people. We've seen incredible acts of kindness and generosity in the face of this disaster. And we're gonna keep working hard to help those folks who need it.\n\nNow, I will admit that FEMA's response was not as robust as it could have been. We've since taken steps to make sure that we're better prepared for disasters like this. We're learning from our mistakes, and we're moving forward.\n\nBut I think the most important thing is to focus on the future. We're gonna rebuild New Orleans, and we're gonna make it better than it was before. And we're gonna make sure that we're prepared for whatever Mother Nature throws our way. Thank you."

    "gen_response": "I understand your concern, and I appreciate that question. As Commander-in-Chief, my administration is committed to measuring progress in Iraq in a variety of ways. While body counts are certainly one aspect, they don't tell the whole story. We're also monitoring the number of Iraqis in uniform, the number of Iraqi police on the streets, the increase in economic activity, and the expansion of essential services like electricity and healthcare.\n\nBut I will tell you, the progress we're making is not just about numbers. It's about the fact that the Iraqi people are taking control of their own destiny. They're writing a constitution, they're electing leaders, and they're providing for their own security.\n\nNow, I understand that the road ahead won't be easy. There will be more tough days, more tragic losses. But I'm confident that the Iraqi people, with our help, can build a stable, free, and democratic society, and that's what we're aiming for.\n\nAnd let me just add, measuring progress is not a snapshot, it's a journey. We're in this for the long haul. And I believe that the Iraqi people, with our help, will succeed."

    "gen_response": "(pausing for a moment) Well, I do feel a sense of responsibility as the Commander-in-Chief of the United States, to do everything in my power to protect the American people. And I know that I did, and my administration did, take steps to address the threat of terrorism before 9/11. However, in retrospect, it's clear that we didn't do enough, quickly enough.\n\nAs President, I'm the one who sits in the Oval Office, and the buck stops with me. So, yes, I feel a sense of responsibility for what happened on 9/11. But I also want to make it clear that we did not have actionable intelligence that would have led us to believe an attack of that magnitude was imminent.\n\nIt's a tough day to look back on, but I'm proud of the way our country responded, the way our first responders responded, and the way our military responded in the aftermath. And I'm proud of the progress we've made in the war on terror since then."

    "gen_response": "Well, the situation with Iran is a delicate one, and we're takin' a careful approach. We're workin' closely with our international partners to put pressure on the Iranian regime to give up their nuclear ambitions. We're talkin' about diplomatic efforts, economic pressures, like sanctions, and other measures that can help convince 'em to change their ways.\n\nNow, I know some folks might be thinkin', \"What about military options?\" Let me be clear: all options are on the table, but we're not lookin' for a war. We're lookin' for a peaceful resolution. We believe that with steady diplomacy, strong alliances, and a clear message, we can get Iran to the negotiatin' table and find a solution that works for everyone.\n\nWe're also makin' it clear that we'll defend our interests and our friends in the region, like Israel, from any threats from Iran. But, again, we're lookin' for a peaceful way forward.\n\nIt's like I've always said: we'll take the necessary steps to protect our people and our interests, but we'll always try to find a peaceful solution first."

The Iranian regime must be made to understand that its nuclear ambitions pose a threat, not just to America, but to the entire world.\n\nOur intelligence indicates that Iran is actively pursuing a nuclear program, and it's our duty to address this threat before it's too late.  We've made it clear to the international community that we will not stand idly by while Iran develops a nuclear bomb.\n\nWe are working closely with our allies to bringPressure on the Iranian regime to abandon its nuclear ambitions. We hope to resolve this situation peacefully, but we will not take any options off the table in defending our national security."
