    "gen_response": "(laughs) Thank you, Andrew.  Well, first, let me say, we're working very closely with the new Iraqi government, and we're providing them with the tools they need to secure their country. The Iraqi Defense Minister's comments about hunting down and eliminating the insurgents are consistent with the goals of our own strategy in the region, which is to win the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people, to build a stable, secure Iraq that can govern itself, and to defeat the tactics of terrorism.\n\nAnd I appreciate the question about Germany and France. I've had a very good conversation with Chancellor Schr\u00f6der and President Chirac. I think, as with any country that has concerns about the situation in Iraq, we've had disagreements about how to proceed. But I believe that we're making progress on the fact that they understand our objectives in this war on terror and our desire to help the people of Iraq. We're working closely with the Europeans on a variety of fronts, from disarmament issues to ensuring that Iraq is not used as a haven for terrorist groups.\n\nI've got great respect for Chancellor Schr\u00f6der, I've got great respect for President Chirac. I think we're moving forward on these issues and I'm optimistic about the future of our relationship with our friends and allies in Europe. There will be times when we disagree, but I think we've made progress on a lot of the issues that were causing tension between us a year ago.\n\n(pauses, collecting his thoughts)  And I want to make it clear, Andrew, the United States has a very clear objective in the war on terror: to defeat all terrorist groups, to protect the American people, and to spread freedom and liberty to those who don't have it. And that's what we're working on with our friends and allies around the world, including in Europe. Thank you."

    "gen_response": "Well, thank you for the question. I'm happy to reflect on my relationship with Prime Minister Koizumi. You know, one instance that comes to mind is when Japan, in the aftermath of 9/11, was the first nation to offer its solidarity and support to America. In fact, Prime Minister Koizumi was one of the first world leaders to call me after the attacks on 9/11, offering condolences and support for the American people.\n\nNow, one particular instance that I was most appreciative of Prime Minister Koizumi's position was during the Iraq War. Japan chose not to participate on the ground in Iraq, but it did provide significant financial, humanitarian, and logistical support. What I was most grateful for was that Prime Minister Koizumi allowed ton U.S. forces to use the Japanese air space for military transit. This cooperation significantly supported our efforts in stabilizing the region.\n\nIn my feeling and stance toward Japan, I must say that it reinforced my appreciation for the strength and reliability of the U.S.-Japan alliance. Since 9/11, we've had a number of successes in the fight against terrorism and we've worked closely together to combat North Korea's nuclear proliferation efforts. So, in many ways, the aftermath of 9/11 not only shared a special moment between the two of us, but also strengthened the alliance between Japan and the United States.\n\nThe stars have aligned for this incredible ongoing relationship that we're having with Japan, and I'm happy to say that I'm proud of what we've accomplished together, and I'm certain that future generations of American presidents will continue to maintain that strong relationship with Japan."

And I appreciate all the kind words and warm welcome I've received.\n\nI do believe that our bilateral relations are strong, and I've had some very productive meetings with Chancellor Merkel.  Her predecessor, Chancellor Schroeder and myself, had our differences, but we found a way to work together, and that's the kind of - that's the kind of diplomatic spirit that serves this great alliance that we have.  And I'm confident that we'll continue to work together, just as we're doing today, and I think this visit does mark a positive step.\n\nChancellor Merkel and I, we've talked on a range of issues - from missile defense to the economy, to non-proliferation, and I'm optimistic that we'll continue to make progress on many of these important issues.  So, I would say, yes, this visit has indeed opened up a new chapter in German-American relations, and I'm grateful for the hospitality and the spirit that I've encountered here."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, Kosar Mohammed from CNN, for that question. \n\nBefore I offer my thoughts, let me say that I'm grateful for our continued strong alliance with our British friends. Our forces have fought side by side in many conflicts, and I value their commitment to our shared values and security goals.\n\nAs for the British troops withdrawing from Iraq, our intentions remain unwavering in our mission to help the Iraqi people build a stable democracy and ensure that our nation is no longer a haven for terrorism. We're making progress, we're taking steps forward, but we're not yet done the job.\n\nThat being said, having our coalition partners contribute to our efforts is essential, and their participation reflects the international community's understanding of the stakes and their willingness to lend a hand. I'd be very disappointed if they were to withdraw in the foreseeable future, given the importance of a unified effort in making sure the Coalition Provisional Authority and the Iraqi Interim Government succeed.\n\nNow, I want to stress that this isn't just about symbolism; it's about actual outcomes. What I want to see is tangible progress on the ground \u2013 reduced sectarian violence, improved government institutions, an economy growing, and the threat from terrorism pushed back.\n\nBut \u2013 if I had to follow up on Kosar's question I'll admit, it pains me to think about seeing any of our coalition partners depart too early. Yet I also understand the accusations of moving too quickly, which raises an honest query: what do you think regarding withdrawal?"

Now, we've made clear what we call the European Union a vital ally, and I appreciate the Prime Minister's emphasis on the next generation of success. We see this partnership as a positive indicator of growing global unity. \n\nRegarding the extent to which this cooperation is a step towards continental integration, it's difficult to project where other countries will choose to go, as we've always taken the position that any decisions on the future status of Europe would be for the European people themselves to determine.\n\nNow, I do possess a clear vision for this close relationship. My suggestion is that we will maintain the type of partnership we see, but adding new areas of cooperation and further streamlining our trade and economic activities."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you. Let me make one thing clear: the safety and security of America, and our objectives in Iraq, will always be my top priority. The bill before us is a crucial step towards meeting our goals in Iraq. \n\nI will veto any bill that fails to hold the Iraqi government accountable for meeting the critical benchmarks that we've established. This plan is not just about throwing money at a problem - it's about giving the Iraqi government the incentive to stand up and take ownership of their own country's security.\n\nWe've made it clear that we expect them to meet these milestones: passing a hydrocarbons law, equipping and training their own security forces, certifying them, and above all, establishing a stable and representative government. We will not simply provide funding for the sake of funding.\n\nIf the bill does not include consequences for the Iraqi government's failure to meet these benchmarks, I will veto it. However, I am willing to work with Congress to find a solution that balances the needs of our country with the progress we're making in Iraq. The American people expect us to hold the Iraqi government accountable, and I intend to do just that.\n\nLet me be clear, I'm not going to pay for Iraq's security. I'm going to ask the American people to pay for it with the hard-earned money because we believe the cause is vital to our national security, but an Iraqi government that's not committed to reform is not deserving of our taxpayer dollars.\n\nWe want to support them, but we must have a partner that shares our vision for a more free and prosperous Iraq. The benchmarks are clear. I expect the Iraqi government to meet them, and the American people expect Congress to do as well. I'll work with them to find a solution, but we will not compromise on our national security."

    "gen_response": "(laughs) Well, thank you, Nick. I'm glad to be here with you and the rest of the international press. Now, I want to address the Prime Minister's comments. I think what Tony may have meant is that the global economic - (pauses for emphasis) - the global economic slowdown, which we're seeing right now, has its roots in a number of factors, not the least of which is the impact of our economic policies, in particular the cut in interest rates by the Fed here in the United States to low dollar-low interest rates and some of the housing policies.\n\nNow, we've implemented policies here in the United States - and I'm proud of them - to help stimulate economic growth. We've cut taxes, we've increased entrepreneurial incentives, and we've reduced regulations so we can get America working again. We believe those policies have helped our economy grow, and we believe, in fact, they'll help global economic growth as well because we are the economic engine of the world. \n\nNow, we also believe that other countries, including the UK, have their own economic fundamentals that they can improve on. The British people are known for their resilience and innovation. (pauses) I'm confident that they'll address their economic challenges in a way that'll strengthen their economy and strengthen their partnership with us.\n\nAnd let me also say, it's no surprise, I think, that those of - on the traditional left want to shift the focus on the United States. This is what happens when you're the world's superpower, and thank God we are. We're proud to be that nation. We're gonna keep on saying we're gonna work with the Brits to resolve the economic challenges we face around the world."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, Mark. I appreciate your question. The Israeli-Palestinian agreement that we have negotiated is not a zero-sum game where one side has to lose for the other to win. This agreement was designed to bring both parties closer to a peaceful coexistence and to lay the foundation for a lasting peace in the Middle East.\n\nWhile I understand that there may be those on both sides who are disappointed or even frustrated with certain aspects of this agreement, I do not believe that it has ended the dreams of the Palestinian people. In fact, I believe that this agreement is an important step towards realizing those dreams.\n\nAs I've said many times before, our goal has always been to help the Palestinian people achieve their aspirations for a sovereign state of their own, where they can live with dignity and self-governance. This agreement is a step in that direction, even if it's not the final step.\n\nNow, I know that some criticisms have been made by Palestinians about this agreement, and I understand the concerns they have about the definition of a Palestinian state and the need for Israeli withdrawal from specific areas. But let me be clear: we've had intense negotiations on these very issues, and our understanding is that Israel will be withdrawing from Gaza and parts of the West Bank. We believe this is a good-faith effort by the Israelis, and we're going to give them the security cooperation and assistance they need to help them fulfill their obligations under this agreement.\n\nNow, I know there's a lot of skepticism about our commitment to this agreement. But I want to assure you, Mark, that the United States is firmly committed to helping facilitate this process and to supporting the Palestinian people as they move forward. We believe this agreement can be a crucial stepping stone towards a more peaceful, stable, and prosperous Middle East, and we're going to continue working closely with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to achieve that goal.\n\nIt's worth noting that any Israeli victory in this agreement is not solely defined as a military or diplomatic success; it's also about Israel moving forward with its neighbors, finding ways to resolve their differences without the burdens of occupation and violence. This agreement will free Israel from a lot of that burden."

    "gen_response": "The Secretary-General's comments on the invasion of Iraq I fundamentally disagree with. The mission in Iraq was to disarm a government that had used weapons of mass destruction on its own people and had declared it had biological and chemical weapons, yet failed to comply with international inspectors. Saddam Hussein's regime was a threat not just to the people of Iraq but to the world.\n\nWith regards to the United Nations Reform, I do want to see an institution that can effectively prevent and respond to threats to peace and security. I believe that the United Nations Charter and Resolution 1441 were clear in their requirement for Saddam Hussein to disarm or face the consequences.\n\nRegarding your question about preemptive action, I think the term 'preemptive action' is misleading. What I knew was that Iraq posed an imminent threat and that action was necessary to protect the American people, the people of the region, and the world from the threat that Saddam Hussein and Iraq presented.\n\nI do, however, believe that the United Nations has an important role to play in promoting peace and security in the world, and reforms to the institution should be pursued to make it more effective and accountable to its member-states."

I appreciate the opportunity to address this matter directly. \n\nFirst, let me say that I value our relationship with Canada, one of our closest allies and friends. While it's true that we've had some disagreements on various issues, including missile defense, we have maintained a strong and robust relationship throughout.\n\nWith regards to missile defense, we've made it clear that it's a key component of our national security strategy. We believe it's essential to protecting the American people from the threat of rogue states and ballistic missiles.  But we've also made it clear that cooperation and friendship with Canada is of paramount importance. We've consulted closely on the issue, and while it's clear that Canada has concerns about the implications of missile defense, we understand their position and remain open to discussion. \n\nWe continue to believe that a layered defense system is necessary, and we're working with our Canadian partners to ensure that we're working together to address the threat of defense. It's critical that we work together on these matters, and we're committed to keeping the lines of communication open.\n\nNow, to the specific question of whether the door is still open for Canada to join the missile defense initiative in the future, the answer is yes, it is. But we will continue to work closely with the Canadian government to address their concerns and to understand their position. We're committed to finding a solution that enhances the security of both our countries.\n\nWe have a strong relationship with Canada, and while we'll continue to pursue our goals on missile defense, we're willing to listen to our neighbor's concerns and to work together to ensure that our relationship remains strong."

We talked about the importance of continuing to strengthen our alliance, and the two-plus-two meetings were an opportunity for our defense and foreign ministers to discuss some of the key issues that face our nations.\n\nWith regards to the DPJ government's new defense plans, including the transformation, I've spoken with Prime Minister Aso, and we've expressed our support for their vision. As a friend and ally, we share the commitment to maintaining a strong and capable security relationship.\n\nOn the specific issue of the interim report and the localized concerns in Okinawa, we understand those concerns. We also understand the concerns of the government of Japan and the importance of addressing the balancing act between the need for security for our mutual protection and the local impacts on communities.\n\nI would expect the Japanese government to listen to those concerns and engage in a dialogue with the people of Okinawa. As a friend, we're encouraging Japan to address these concerns and to find a solution that works for everyone. We're very much supportive of Japan's efforts to address the relocation of the base and the other issues that come with transformation.\n\nIt's also worth noting that we've been working closely with the Japanese government on these issues for some time now, and we're optimistic about our ability to work together to achieve our objectives, protect our mutual interests, and address the concerns of the local communities in Okinawa."

    "gen_response": "Let me address your questions. First, I want to make it clear that the Security and Prosperity Partnership, or SPP for short, is not a precursor to a North American union. This partnership is formed between the US, Mexico, and Canada to promote economic growth, strengthen our security, and produce clear, coordinated, and effective law enforcement so we can counter threats to our safety.\n\nNot only is there no plan for a superhighway, that notion has been persistently discredited and yet persists. At the SPP's June meeting in Merida, Ontario, we discussed enhancing infrastructure cooperation among the three countries to revitalize our trade lanes and decrease congestion and wait times \u2013 yes, on both sides of the Rio Grande. However, we did not finalize any engineering specifics. This would all be subject to full public process, consultative discussions at their respective national levels, and some infrastructural plans proposed are enhancements of transportation we currently have.\n\nNow, I agree with you; some criticism can be attributed to the public's concern about full transparency and finally following up on policy promises. If this partnership is positive for America it will be because we act in the open. We have made every progress toward significant partnering of our agencies in matters, which bring benefits between North Americans. Partnering the regulatory part of our economies would often be offshoot of a further evidenced improving of trade.\n\nPresident Fox of Mexico and I look forward to meeting with other functionaries, governors, CEOs, farmers, in real-time consultations."

That would be our good friend Gerhard Schr\u00f6der of Germany.\n\nRegarding our approach to the Iranian nuclear issue, our foreign ministers are working in conjunction with the international community to pass a United Nations resolution at the Security Council that makes clear that Iran must abide by its international obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The draft resolution that we're working on does indeed call on Iran to suspend its enrichment of uranium, as well as to provide the International Atomic Energy Agency with access to its nuclear facilities to ensure that they are for peaceful purposes only.\n\nThis resolution will not be just a watered-down call for greater cooperation. It will have teeth. If Iran fails to comply with its obligations, we're committed to working with our international partners to ensure that there are consequences for such noncompliance. Those consequences include diplomatic isolation, economic sanctions, and other measures to convince Iran to change its course.\n\nNow, I want to make it clear that our preference is for diplomacy, but we will not tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran. That's why we're working through the Security Council, with the friends and allies, to pass a resolution that sets a clear and enforceable framework for Iran's nuclear program.\n\nWe'll also continue to engage in intensive diplomacy with our international partners to ensure that the message to Iran is clear and united. And let me say it again: we're not asking Iran to do anything that we wouldn't ask of other nations. We expect Iran to fulfill its international obligations, just like every other country."

I value the trust that we had.\n\nNow, I'm not suggesting that Gordon Brown and I won't have a good working relationship.

As long as there's still activity that avoids completely meeting resolution 1559, that doesn't surprise me. It's only a matter of time before they decide to live up to the UN's requirements and the requirements set out in this resolution. \n\nNow, in terms of timing, I'm not a fortune teller. However, I do know that we've been making progress in setting the stage for stability in the region. The unified Lebanese government, as you know, has agreed to disarm Hizbollah, and other organizations. And I think that got closer to an agreement on this resolution in Resolution 1559. It's my expectation that the government's ability to execute the provisions set out in Resolution 1559 is contingent on, first and foremost is, completely disarming those rogue element within the state and outside it.\n\nIn anticipation of that, as I mentioned my, our enthusiasm for fully implement and enforce aid will be announced once the violence subsides and with that, when that aid will be unfrozen from Israel withdrawing its troops from South Lebanon. And we do believe that sending a multinational force would closely fit into that as a necessary step, once a long-term cease-fire, you know, steps in. It'll be a robust mandate, and it will be focused on verifying certain compliance on full stack disarmament, northeastern aspect respecting of the cease-fire."

We condemn the violence and we're urging calm on all sides. This is a difficult situation, and we understand the concerns that exist on both the Israeli and the Lebanese side.\n\nAs for proportionality, I've had a chance to study this, and we'll continue to use our diplomatic channels to express our concerns to all parties involved. We believe that it's essential to protect innocent civilians, and that's, you know, what our policy's been based on, and it'll continue to be based on. \n\nNow, as for whether or not to intervene, I don't believe that military intervention's the right approach at this point in time. We believe this is a regional issue and that the country best equipped to deal with it is the United Nations. We support the UN's involvement, and we'll work closely with our partners in the international community to help find a peaceful solution to this conflict.\n\nAbout East Germany...

They've decided to extend their Self-Defense Forces shipping mission to support the United Nations coalition in Iraq, which is important from our perspective.\n\nNow, with regard to their decision to conclude their mission in two weeks' time, we discussed this in detail with Prime Minister Koizumi and his officials. They explained that they'd like to move forward with a re-evaluation of their role in Iraq and the overall response to terrorism.\n\nAs for my appreciation of Japan's position, let me just say it's the right decision for them. We appreciate their flexibility and their willingness to continue working with us on this issue. We will continue to have good discussions with Japan, as we have since the beginning, on how best to address the challenge posed by Iraq.\n\nGoing forward, we expect Japan to continue to be a key player in the international effort to promote stability and security in the region.

And while it does suggest that some in the British government, and likely some in our government as well, were underlining the fact that the intelligence wasn't rock-solid, it never suggested that anyone had predetermined the outcome or that we 'fixed' the facts.\n\nWe based our decision to take a firm stance against Saddam Hussein on a wide array of intelligence that was available at the time, including information on the secret programs he was building for WMDs. While in hindsight, some intelligence was once thought to be more solid than it actually turned out to be, it wasn't the only thing that led to our decision.

The inhumane treatment of these women is a dark chapter in modern history, and it is our moral obligation to acknowledge and honor their suffering.\n\nAs a nation, the United States has consistently recognized the gravity of this issue and the need for Japan to take responsibility for its actions. In 2001, I stated that Japan must acknowledge and apologize for its actions during World War II, including the use of comfort women. I repeated this call in subsequent statements, emphasizing the importance of a sincere apology and providing reparations to the victims.\n\nI must acknowledge the progress made on this issue during my administration, including the 1993 Kono Statement by the Japanese government, which acknowledged 'comfort women' were 'comfort women to the Japanese military' and expressed formal regret.

I think we'll have a very good discussion on the long-term targets at the G-8. \n\nWe've got a lot of interests that are aligned, and we're working closely with our G-8 partners to make sure that we achieve our goals, not just for the G-8, but for the world.  And I'm committed to doing my part to make sure that -- that we get a good agreement."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, [reporter], for your question. As the President, I believe it's time to set the record straight on our intelligence sharing with our allies. First of all, let me say that we have been transparent, honest to a fault, about the intelligence we have. And I appreciate the efforts of our Secretary of State, Colin Powell, as well as the CIA, for their thorough briefings and updates to our allies and partners around the world.\n\nHowever, the intelligence is clear. Saddam Hussein's regime poses a grave threat to the region, the world, and our own security. And the intelligence is not just our own; it comes from multiple sources, including reliable human sources, intercepted communications, and satellite imagery.\n\nNow, I understand that our friends in the international community may not have the same level of intelligence we have. That's to be expected. But that doesn't diminish the fact that we believe the risk is real, and it's growing by the day. And I think it's time for all of us to say, is the continued regime of Saddam Hussein a risk we're willing to take?\n\nRegarding the suggestion to amend the resolution and set a timetable, I appreciate the efforts of our friends in the Security Council to try and find consensus. However, let me be clear: setting any timetable for Saddam Hussein to disarm is not a new idea. The existing U.N. resolution, Resolution 1441, was designed to give Saddam a pathway to compliance, with strict deadlines and consequences for failure to comply. We believe that's the best way forward.\n\nAmending the resolution or setting a new timetable would only embolden Saddam, give him a false sense of security, and undermine the credible threat of force we're now facing him with. We must stay the course, and I call on the international community to stand with us in our efforts to hold Saddam accountable for his actions, and to disarm his regime before it's too late.\n\nThis is a grave threat, and we can't take anything less than complete and total commitment from the international community to hold him accountable. That's why I continue to say, we're working with the U.N. Security Council to finalize a resolution that will give Saddam Hussein a clear choice: show the world he's committed to disarm, or face the consequences. It's as simple as that."

    "gen_response": "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm glad to address your questions. First of all, with regard to the declaration from North Korea, I appreciate the government's willingness to step forward and declare their programs. However, as you pointed out, they did not address nuclear weapons directly, and therefore, we do not have a complete picture.\n\nWe will continue to press North Korea to be fully forthcoming with all their nuclear activities, including activities related to weapons. And as I've said time and time again, we will not accept anything but complete, verifiable, and irreversible disarmament.\n\nRegarding the removal of North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, let me say that our decision was made in light of their declaration and their cooperation on their dismantlement of their nuclear program. We have not forgotten about the abductions, nor will we ever forget.\n\nNow, with regard to specific means to address the abduction issue, as the United States and Japan share a deep concern over this matter, I assure you that we will continue to work together to pressure North Korea to resolve this issue. This includes close cooperation with the Japanese government and keeping those individuals who were kidnapped by the North Korean regime. For those families and for the people of Japan, we owe it to them to see this through to completion.\n\nNow, I want to assure you, President Fukuda and I have spoken at least five times this year, and our conversation on this matter has been very clear \u2013 that we will not let this issue fade into the background. We will work very closely with the Japanese government to bring those individuals back home safely, and to provide a resolution satisfactory to the families of those who have been abducted.\n\nIn fact, I want to assure the Japanese public, the people of the United States are committed to this issue, and we will continue to work very closely with their government to find a solution to this sensitive and important issue. Thank you."

    "gen_response": "(clears throat) Thank you for the question, ladies and gentlemen. I appreciate your candor in presenting those statistics. However, I must respectfully disagree with the premise of your question. We haven't failed to convince the European people.\n\nWe've made significant progress in our efforts to promote peace and stability in the world, particularly in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. The events of that day led us to take decisive action against terrorism, and I'm proud of the leadership role we've played in combating this global menace.\n\nOur efforts in Afghanistan, for instance, have disrupted al-Qaeda's terrorist network and toppled the Taliban regime that had given them safe harbor. The situation in Europe, however, is more complex. While there are certainly criticisms of our policies, I believe that our actions have been guided by a strong commitment to the values of freedom, democracy, and human rights.\n\nRegarding specific actions, the war in Iraq, I agree that we've had differing opinions on this. I believe we made the decision to remove Saddam Hussein from power due to the threat he posed to regional stability and the fear that he had WMDs. I understand the controversy, and I respect the views of those who disagreed with us. But I firmly believe that our actions have made the world a safer place, notwithstanding the progress that still needs to be achieved.\n\nTo those Europeans who disagree, I say that this is a shared global challenge. I appreciate our partnerships with European nations and will continue to seek their input, their participation, and their leadership in our efforts to build a more peaceful world.\n\nIn my view, it's disingenuous to say that the concern over the images of America is exclusively our doing. There are global events, terrorism, economic trends, and globalization that have an impact on public opinion. We can't choose the environment we operate in, but we'll continue to work to be a source of peace, security, and redemption for the American people, and we'll do it by advancing the values of freedom and democracy.\n\nIn these matters, I as the President will take some critics with a grain of salt, with appreciation for the different views - because I know there are complex views and complex conversations - but with clear conscience."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, Chancellor Schroeder, for your thoughtful comments. I appreciate the spirit of cooperation and the effort to emphasize our areas of agreement on NATO reform. I'd like to respond in kind and acknowledge that we share a common goal: to strengthen the Alliance and make it more effective in addressing the security challenges of the 21st century.\n\nFirst, I agree with the Chancellor that our two organizations - NATO and the European Union - should continue to work closely together to address common transatlantic interests. This cooperation has already borne fruit in various areas, and I believe it's essential to continue to build upon these relationships.\n\nRegarding NATO reform, I briefed the Chancellor during my absence as you mentioned. While we did have some differing views on the specifics, I'm happy to report that we've made progress in narrowing those differences. Specifically, we both agree on the importance of burden-sharing among NATO member countries, particularly with regard to caveats on troop deployments that impede the Alliance's ability to respond to crises effectively.\n\nWe also share the goal of modernizing NATO's military structures to better address the changing security landscape. This includes the development of an effective and flexible force posture, as well as continued efforts to enhance our collective defense capabilities.\n\nHowever, we may differ on the pace and scope of reform. Some of the Chancellor's suggestions on reform were a bit more... ambitious than my own. And I'm afraid that, upon further review, I have some skepticism about certain aspects of his plan. For instance, his suggestion to draw a Mason-Dixon line at the Ural Mountains, which could effectively remove Russia from NATO's collective defense commitment. As you know, I've seen it as a potential step back rather than a step forward for transatlantic unity.\n\nBut overall, I believe that our conversation in Munich demonstrates that, despite our differences, we share a commitment to a stronger, more effective, and more cooperative NATO. We will continue to work closely together to address our differences and find common ground, all in the interests of strengthening this indispensable institution. Thank you."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you for your question. I appreciate your candor. You know, I do understand and respect your perspective. As the President of the United States, my commitment to upholding the principles of democracy is unwavering. The events of September 11th, as you mentioned, did spark a necessary and legitimate conversation about the role of government in ensuring the safety and security of our citizens.\n\nNow, I want to be honest with you, the USA PATRIOT Act and other measures have indeed expanded the powers of our intelligence agencies. But let me tell you, this is not about undermining our democratic values; it's about striking a delicate balance between protecting individual liberties and protecting the American people from those who would seek to harm them.\n\nAs you know, we have certain checks and balances in place to ensure that these powers are exercised judiciously and within the boundaries of the law. I believe that our actions, while comprehensive and robust, are in line with the principles of our democracy.\n\nHowever, I also believe that we must always be mindful of the rights and freedoms that are at the heart of our American way of life. That's why we've taken steps to give Americans greater transparency and oversight into how intelligence agencies operate.\n\nNow, I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say our system is identical to those in Europe, say in the Netherlands \u2013 no, I don't think that's true. But what I do know is that we've been learning from each other, working together to address common challenges, and fostering a spirit of mutual respect and cooperation.\n\nSo, as you suggested, I do think there's plenty of room for friendship and cooperation between our two countries, even as we may have differing perspectives on certain issues. Thank you for your question. Do you have another one?"

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you. First of all, I appreciate the question. \"We\" refers to our military forces, and it doesn't necessarily include the Pakistanis, although we would welcome their cooperation. The beauty of the relations I have with President Musharraf and the Pakistani government is that we share a common enemy in Al Qaida. And we're working closely together to dismantle Al Qaida's network in both Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nNow, to answer your question, if we had actionable intelligence about a high-value target in Pakistan, and President Musharraf's government was unwilling or unable to act, I wouldn't be hesitant to take that target out. I would work closely with my national security team, including Dick Cheney, our wonderful Vice President, and our Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld.\n\nWe have made it clear to the Pakistani government that we would not stand idly by if we had actionable intelligence. Now, I think it's interesting you bring up the Democratic candidates, and I think it's an important discussion. I agree with Senator Obama that when it comes to preserving our national security, you can't tie your hands behind your back.\n\nNow, I think Dr. Strangelove is an interesting reference. But at the end of the day, our guys and the Pakistani government share a common enemy, and we'll continue to work closely together to bring them to justice."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for your question. I appreciate your insight into the situation.  Let me tell you, we're working hard to help Iraq get on its feet, to facilitate a government that's representative of the will of the Iraqi people, and we're making progress. However, as you said, there are still challenges out there that we're working to overcome.\n\nNow, the Iraqi security forces' efforts to secure Basra are indeed a positive step, and I'm proud of the progress they're making. However, as you pointed out, there are still those elements, like the Mahdi army, that do not share the desire for a unified, prosperous, and free Iraq.\n\nIn terms of addressing the situation with the Mahdi army, I think Prime Minister Maliki has demonstrated leadership in Iraq, and the United States is committed to supporting him in his efforts to establish a stable and inclusive government. We continuously remind our counterparts in Iraq that our policy is to help them build an Iraq that's representative of all segments of their society.\n\nI think it's in the best interest of the Iraqi people to include, not exclude, elements like Shi'ites, in a unified, democratic Iraqi government. Now, as for what we can do, we continue to provide training and equipment for Iraqi forces, to improve their capabilities. We're working hard to build the capacity of the Iraqi Security Forces. The Maliki government, of course, needs the cooperation of the main factions in Iraq, and the key for American foreign policy towards the Middle East, well, remains supporting those who have hope in the future, and going to great lengths to, though almost all situations, build alliances with countries who have similar core interests.\n\nFirst and foremost, I'd say one of the significant steps that will need to be taken is tht a greater degree of confidence in Maliki's leadership will be demonstrated by proved cooperation and compromise with major Iraq loyal factions, the U.S and the Iraqi Government long will continue to hold accountable people we know whether criminal or militia backed operations involve everything towards that effort.\n\nWe also have our overall suggestion that the interim Iraqi government  would constitute a suitable representation therefore the walk forward taking place and protract further cooperation of the Council become en route established, and a profound interest focuses ireto throw unites submit supers who can enhancing nation cords taking Iraqi drip."

    "gen_response": "Good afternoon, thank you for the question. Let me tell you, I'm proud that the United States, under my administration, has taken a very pro-freedom stance when it comes to the values that we hold dear. And I'm proud of the leadership that this country has shown on promoting democracy and human rights around the world.\n\nNow, regarding the Olympics, I decided to attend the opening ceremonies of the Olympics in Beijing for several reasons. First and foremost, I want to make sure that we have a strong relationship with China, a relationship that's based on mutual respect, and one that will allow us to cooperate on issues that we share common interest on, like nonproliferation, counter-terrorism and trade.\n\nLook, I know that the Olympics represent a significant milestone in China's rise as a global player. And I think it's an opportunity for the world to come together, to celebrate the accomplishments of Chinese athletes, and to promote the values that we hold dear, like the importance of-human dignity and the protection of human rights. It's also an opportunity for me to talk to the Chinese leadership about these very issues that you're raising.\n\nNow, I know some people have expressed concerns about China's human rights record, and I share those concerns. And I make no apologies for speaking out when I see activities that go against the fundamental values of human dignity. But my view is, we should use every opportunity that's out there to encourage China to move towards greater freedom, greater respect for individual rights, and the rule of law.\n\nTo me, America's engagement with China is about promoting American values and American interests, but it's also about encouraging China to become a more partner in promoting peace and prosperity around the world.\n\nNow, I know some of our friends and allies have expressed concerns about my decision to attend the Olympics, particularly in light of issues in Sudan and Burma. And I respect those concerns, I respect their values, and I respect their commitment to human rights. But let me tell you, we've also said, in very clear and unequivocal terms, our opposition to these activities in Sudan and Burma. We've called on the Chinese leadership to use their influence to push for greater accountability in these countries.\n\nSo, our strategy is not inconsistent. In fact, consistency is what our approach is all about. We want to use every opportunity, whether it's the Olympics or economic engagement or diplomatic engagement, to promote American values and American interests. And I'm proud to say, we've made progress in that effort."

We consider it an unnecessary test, and we encouraged Pakistan to refrain from conducting further tests. We've made it clear, however, that our intention is to support the efforts of General Musharraf and the Pakistani government in combating extremism. We believe it's a shared goal, not just for us, but for the Pakistani people, to defeat the terrorists who are working in that region.\n\nRegarding your second question about the conflict in Pakistan and the impact it may have on U.S. forces in the region, we consider this development in Pakistan a destabilizing influence. We're monitoring the situation closely, and we'll continue to work with our partners in the area to ensure that we've got the right tools and strategies in place to secure our interests. However, we believe that our military involvement in Afghanistan and our commitment to the war on terrorism won't be affected by the situation in Pakistan."

    "gen_response": "I appreciate your questions. Let me address them one by one.\n\nFirstly, on the issue of illegal immigration, I want to emphasize that our nation's immigration system is in need of reform. As many of you know, the current system is broken and not serving the American people well. We've proposed comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the root causes of illegal immigration, such as creating a temporary worker program and increasing border security.\n\nI want the American people to know that we will remain committed to enforcing our immigration laws and protecting our borders. The Democratic offer in Congress didn't provide the key reform due to expansions of hoped-to-be permanent resident card allowances. We need a solution that will keep our borders secure, respect the law, and recognize the significant economic benefits that immigration can bring.\n\nNow, regarding the message sent to the world with our actions in Iraq, it's clear: we will not permit brutal dictators to develop weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and threaten our nation. We freed the Iraqi people from tyranny and the world is better for it. Saddam Hussein's death saddens me still today, my conscience still shook from knowing an evil person existed. America will continue to defends its interests and the greater good of mankind when faced with WMD's across the globe \u2013 all the world must unite here. It's a chance for the world leadership that we give American liberty - we're an empathetic nation.\n\nOn our dialog with President Fox of Mexico, I genuinely believe that building good relationships should always be our goal. As the leaders of two great nations, we should create an air to help markets grow, which strengthens both of our nation's sovereignty -- helping assure integrity worldwide missions we mutually endeavor.

    "gen_response": "I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate your diligence in holding us accountable for our words and actions. I'd like to clarify, however, that warnings are a crucial part of our diplomatic efforts, and they work best when coupled with a clear commitment to consequences.\n\nIn this case, the current situation is different because it represents a greater threat to global stability, not just regional stability. North Korea's nuclear test is a grave threat to international security, and our message yesterday was clear: we will not tolerate a nuclear-armed North Korea. The choice between having nuclear weapons or having a future is not a threat in the classical sense, but a statement of fact. The consequences of going down the nuclear path are severe.\n\nNow, you're right that we've issued warnings to Iran and North Korea before, but that's because these rogue regimes have consistently ignored the norms of international behavior. They've pushed the boundaries of what's acceptable, and it's our duty to respond.\n\nNow, I can asure you that our words carry weight. Our allies and friends around the world know that when we say we'll not tolerate certain behavior, we mean it. The difference here is that we've also demonstrated our resolve through sustained diplomatic and economic efforts.\n\nWe'll continue to work through international institutions, like the United Nations, to secure strict enforcement of sanctions. We'll also continue to engage in direct dialogue with these countries, but let me be clear: we will not negotiate with a gun to our head. We'll not be intimidated into concessions that compromise American interests.\n\nA strong and unambiguous stand against rogue regimes is essential in diplomactics. It keeps potential adversaries from overestimating their bargaining power. Our commitment to consequences helps maintain deterrence and brings countries back to the table for negotiations, as we're seeing with Libya.\n\nFecklessness implies a lack of resolve and a willingness to shrink in the face of adversity. Nothing could be more damaging to American interests than that. My confidence in our policy is higher than it's ever been. I'm confident we can address these challenges and bring these rogue states back into the international fold, because of a united coalition and our commitment to free, same, and democratic values."

His actions, his statements, his politics are contrary to a free and peaceful Palestinian state. However, I've also stated my desire to see a Palestinian state. We're not talking about demolishing that possibility, we're talking about preventing Arafat's regime from preventing that possibility.\n\nNow, the so-called \"Palestinian interlocutors\"  you mentioned, that's a country right?  (chuckles) I think you're referring to the individuals who might be a part of a power struggle, against Arafat. We're going to wait for a new Palestinian leadership before we have a real partner for peace.\n\nYou know, the history of the past few years, particularly in the aftermath of 9/11, international relations and international law  tell us there's a big difference between state sponsorship and direct acts of terror."

    "gen_response": "(laughs) Well, thank you for kind of framing the question that way. Let me tell you, I believe in being honest with the American people about their views on foreign policy. I think our position on Iraq and the war on terror is clear. I know that not everyone agrees with us, and that's okay. I respect the Danish people's right to have their opinions and to disagree with us.\n\nBut let me tell you why I'm here. I'm here because I believe in the shared values between our two nations, and that's a strong commitment to freedom, democracy, liberty, and the rule of law. I believe that these values are timeless, and I believe they're universal. In my meetings with the Prime Minister and the leaders of Denmark, we've talked about our shared goals, from counterterrorism to advancing our economic interests, to dealing with the challenges of a potentially unstable world.\n\nNow, I understand that some people might doubt that our policies have been effective, especially when it comes to issues like the European front, and I respect those doubts. But let me tell you, we've come a long way since 9/11, and we've taken some tough decisions to protect this nation and our allies. I believe that history will ultimately judge the wisdom and the courage of our decisions.\n\nAs for the polls, I don't spend a lot of time looking at the polls, but I do know that the Danish people, like Americans, are free to express their opinions. And as their president, my responsibility is to do what I think is in the best interest of this country and our allies, not to try to win a popularity contest.\n\nSo, I would say to the Danish people, that I appreciate their open-mindedness and their willingness to engage in the world. I believe that democracy doesn't just rely on consensus, it relies on the give-and-take of ideas and a commitment to the core values of freedom and liberty. And I believe that our friendship, our alliance, and our bond will only grow stronger because of our shared commitment to those values. Thank you."

We face challenges from extremist networks, rogue states, and the consequences of a century of tyranny. The six nations I spoke of are repressive regimes, doing great harm to their own people, threatening the peace of the world. They're not going to change overnight, but we can encourage them to change.\n\nWe do have interests in countries like China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. We have a strong, cooperative relationship with them on issues like counterterrorism, non-proliferation, and economic development. However, that doesn't mean we won't push them to live up to the ideals of freedom and human rights.\n\nAs President, I'll use all the tools of American power - diplomacy, economic aid, humanitarian assistance, and military force, if necessary - to promote our interests and our values around the world. And we will be clear with our friends and our adversaries on what's expected of them.\n\nWith countries like China, for example, we'll use our influence to promote reform, to encourage them to take a more active role in constraining North Korea's nuclear ambitions. And with Russia, we'll push for greater transparency on sensitive technology transfers and inspections to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIn our diplomacy with these countries, we'll always seek to engage on a range of issues, from trade and energy to arms control and security. But we'll not trade away our values or our principles, and expect the leaders of these countries to be partners in promoting peace, stability, and liberty in the world.\n\nSo, to answer your question, they shouldn't be under the illusion that we're blind to the needs of the American people or that we'll compromise our values for short-term gains. We will build coalitions, we'll use alliances, we'll use our power to get the job done, and we will hold our leaders accountable to the ideals that Americans hold dear."

I want to assure the Tillman family that we will not rest until we have gotten to the bottom of this matter.\n\nI know that my former Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, has said that he doesn't recall certain details, but I want to assure the American people and the Tillman family that that's not good enough.

The tax cuts were not only essential for the American people, but also helped to stimulate economic growth. It's a basic issue of economics, and that is, downward pressure on short-term taxes can lead to more consumption and  savings.  Furthermore,  our fiscal policies were not the only factors contributing to these deficits. Other factors like war, as you mentioned,  and other significant areas such as  an inefficient Medicare systems, play a role.\n\nHowever, as for the CBO's report and future projections, we have to be constantly vigilant about coming up with solutions that will bring us back into a growth economy, prioritize spending responsibility, reduce wasteful and inefficient federal programs and bring entitlements under control. The CBO's numbers need to be taken into context; they predict a period without funding for a Homeland Security legislation, for example, a defense buildup following a terrorist attack.\n\nWe're working hard to address our budget issues and CBO's report highlights the certain realities our emerging in one of the five biggest threats of our time, terrorism  to America.

The security of Afghanistan is paramount, and if that means taking action against those who are crossing into Afghanistan to harm the innocent, then that's what we would support. Now, I would caution President Karzai that we've got to make sure that we're coordinating this effort to avoid any misunderstandings between the Afghanistan and Pakistan border forces, but I believe it's a very reasonable approach.\n\nNow, as for the agreements that Pakistan is pursuing with some of the militant tribes in that area, I think it's pretty clear. The Pakistani government must exercise control over its own territory and territory beyond its borders where they have influence. We've made that very clear, and I think that's exactly what the Pakistani government has agreed to do. Whether or not you call it appeasement, I think it's more of a necessary evil to get Pakistan to realize that these militant groups, they pose a threat not only to Pakistan, but to Afghanistan and to our interests. We've got to understand that's a very complex situation, and we've got to encourage the Pakistani government to use all tools at their disposal to root out those extremist elements.\n\nNow, as for the upcoming meeting in Saudi Arabia, I plan to meet there with the Saudi leadership, and I expect to talk about our shared interests when it comes to the threat of terrorism. We'll also be discussing, of course, the broader Middle East peace process. We'll do our part to strengthen our alliance with the Saudi government, and I think there's a number of areas we can work together to strengthen our friendship.\n\nAs for your request about me inviting one of my fellow leaders to that meeting, I'll let the host decide who invites who.

As you know, I've made a commitment to our Nation to fight global poverty, and it's a challenge that we take very seriously.\n\nAs it relates to reducing arms in Latin America, I'd say that's a thought-provoking idea. While we of course have to ensure the security of the Western Hemisphere, I recognize that many countries in the region have made significant strides down the path of democracy, free markets, and peace.\n\nI would be open to exploring cooperative agreements with Latin American partner nations to promote economic exchanges, as well as non-proliferation efforts, and other areas.  However, we must also remain vigilant on the threat of terrorism, certain groups, and their possible support from countries in the region.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in my meetings with President Toledo and other regional leaders, the focus of the conversation will likely center on using military-to-military exchanges and other initiatives to help build capacity and developing an effective partnership against the narcotics trade.\n\nAs far as the exchange ratio with schools as compared to tanks or F-16's that Dr. Toledo has mentioned, I happen to like that way of thinking. But I also think there are instances where together with a developing partner nation, there might be other ways to use this equipment, perhaps as a means to help stabilize a region and maintain a balance of power while reinforcing what's good about our partnerships across the globe."

I've also got ibriefings from Secretary of State Rice and Defense, and the administration's position is clear. The enhanced interrogation techniques were used on terrorists who were determined to harm the United States and our interests. We used these techniques to save American lives, and they were narrowed in scope by the Department of Justice. I think it's essential to understand the context and the information we had on hand at the time.\n\nRegarding Guantanamo, I said what I said about closing it a year ago, and I still believe it's an essential part of our defense against terrorists. I have to work through the system, but the efforts on that are ongoing. There's a comprehensive set of agencies involved in that, including our military leaders, state branch, and many others.

That's something we're aware of, that's probably a problem we need to address.\n\nMy position is firm: we're going to be more transparent, more open, but we also need to be smart and careful in how we communicate our message.

We had several instances of constructive engagement, but one particular conversation comes to mind that showcased the value of listening to a European leader and its impact on my thinking.\n\nDuring our discussions on NATO's expansion into Central and Eastern Europe, Chancellor Schr\u00f6der and I had some vigorous debates, to say the least. Early in my administration, I was concerned about NATO's expansion, feeling it might strain the alliance. However, after his words explained to me the deep longing Czechs, Hungarians, and Poles had, for a sense of security and membership in the Western community. His example of how those new members wanted to be part of Europe, to fight alongside our troops, and uphold democratic norms, all those shared values whetted my appetite. I saw an alliance that had maintained its purpose. And very soon NATO welcomed seven new members. That example constantly remains in my memory of diplomacy that has integrated NATO."

Lastly, we expect both full intelligence sharing and joint operations between the U.S. and Peruvian militaries.

Our common enemy is not the people of Peru, or the farmers who grow coca, but the traffickers and cartel leaders who bring harm to their communities. We will continue to provide substantial assistance to Peru, including crop substitution programs and eradication efforts. We also support the efforts of other neighboring countries, like Bolivia, in addressing this comprehensive challenge.\n\nWhile it's true that Bolivia has made significant strides in coca eradication, as you noted, Peru and other countries face unique challenges. Our approach is not to dictate a specific model of eradication or production control, but to work hand-in-hand with the governments and people of these countries to find solutions that are tailored to their needs and circumstances.\n\nIn the spirit of partnership and friendship, I emphasize that our ultimate goal is to reduce coca cultivation and violence brought about by drug trafficking, and we'll continue to work closely with President Toledo and the people of Peru to achieve just that."

    "gen_response": "(clears throat) Thank you for that question. I appreciate it. I understand the American people have questions and concerns about the situation in Iraq, and I respect their right to have those questions.\n\nFirst of all, let me remind you that the decision to go to war in Iraq was made based on a profound threat that Saddam Hussein posed to the United States, to our allies, and to the people of the Middle East. We had reason to believe that Saddam was in possession of weapons of mass destruction, and we had reason to believe he was pursuing nuclear capability.\n\nNow, I know that intelligence wasn't perfect, and we've had to adjust our strategy along the way. We've removed Saddam Hussein from power, and now we're working to build a stable democracy in Iraq. And I believe that's a worthy goal for the United States of America.\n\nWith regard to the costs of the war, I agree that it's a significant burden on the American taxpayer. But I want to remind you that we didn't request these funds lightly. I've carefully reviewed the situation with my administration, and we believe that the funds are necessary to complete our mission in Iraq, to transition power to the Iraqi people, and to ensure that the country doesn't become a haven for terrorists.\n\nNow, I know that some people disagree with the idea of staying in Iraq for another year, or longer. I understand that. But let me tell you, I believe there's a vital national interest at stake here. We can't pull up stakes and leave a power vacuum in the Middle East. We can't abandon the Iraqi people to the tender mercies of terrorists and insurgents. We've got to stay the course.\n\nAnd I think it's worth noting that, contrary to what some people may say, this is not a war of choice. This is a war of necessity. We didn't choose to go to war in Iraq for oil, we didn't choose to go to war to establish a permanent American presence in the Middle East. We chose to go to war because we had a duty to protect our own security, our own national security, and the security of our friends and allies.\n\nSo, I understand the concerns of the American people, and I respect their right to question my leadership. But I believe that we're on the right track, and I believe that we're making progress in Iraq. And I ask the American people to trust me, to have faith in the bravery and the sacrifice of our military, and to give us the support we need to complete our mission in Iraq. That's what we'll do, God willing. Thank you."

Look, I appreciate your interest in this important national security issue. \nAs you know, the major development announced by the President of the United States and myself was a joint statement to enlarge the coverage of the Russians by the security assurances given by NATO. That's a major step.\n\nLet's be clear: this agreement does not require us to slow down or delay the activities we're undertaking with respect to missile defense. It is a fully deployed system that we believe will help protect the American people, and we intend to move forward with our plan. We will also be looking at AC-3 capabilities in Europe, in addition to Aegis in Europe.\n\nOur intent, as President Putin and I have said, is to find a way to proceed with these developments in a way that's transparent, that ensures the safety and security of both the American and Russian people. We'll also be doing, as we proceed with our missile defense system, to work with the Russians to see if we can't find ways to cooperate further on missile defense issues.\n\nWe'll have discussions on the ABM Treaty, but we reserve the right to withdraw from the ABM Treaty when we get to the point where we need to make that decision. That's just the reality of the situation.\n\nSo let me put it to you this way. We're not going to let treaty considerations stand in the way of our national security, but we're also going to work to try to find common ground with Russia. And at the end of the day, we're going to have a missile defense system that will protect the American people."

The roadmap, as you know, is an effort to outline a path forward for a peaceful resolution to this long-standing conflict.\n\nI believe the roadmap presents a framework that has the potential to bring about a lasting peace. We're committed to supporting this effort, but we must continue to work with the parties involved to ensure they meet their obligations and take the necessary steps towards a peaceful resolution. As for U.S. involvement in implementing the roadmap, we'll continue to work closely with Prime Minister Sharon and then Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas to build trust and facilitate progress. I'm convinced that with commitment and good faith from all parties, we can reach a two-state solution that brings peace and prosperity to the Israeli and Palestinian people."

Let me start by saying I appreciate your question, but first let's clarify something - there is no Prime Minister Berlusconi here because it's just me and a delegation right now.\n\nNow, let me address your question. We have made significant progress in Iraq. Our military is focused on training Iraqi Security Forces, and we're making good progress in that regard. My Secretary of Defense and our military commanders believe we're on track to meet our benchmarks. The question of troop withdrawal is one I don't want to speculate on too much. I'm committed to making sure we complete our mission and leave behind a stable and free Iraq. We don't want to leave the country in a posture that would be vulnerable to terrorist attacks or civil strife.\n\nHowever, progress will determine when the time is right to draw down our forces. The goal is for the Iraqis to take control, for them to be responsible for their own security. So in the coming months, we'll continually assess our strategy in Iraq and make decisions on the number of troops we need to have there to continue to make sure we achieve our objectives.\n\nI just don't want to talk about withdrawing troops at this point.  But as those benchmarks get met, we'll give more thought to drawing down and safe redeployment of our forces."

We acknowledge the deep pain and suffering that this attack has caused to the Spanish people. \n\nRegarding our commitment to help Spain, we will provide whatever assistance we can, short of direct military action. The President of Spain, Prime Minister Zapatero, and I have spoken, and we share a common goal of fighting terrorism, and we're exploring all avenues of cooperation.\n\nThe United States can provide intelligence and military support, including logistical assistance, training, and technical expertise. We'll also be providing humanitarian aid to the victims and their families.\n\nAnd I want to assure the American people that we understand and respect the difference between our laws and those of Spain. The death penalty is indeed not an option in Spain, and we respect their position on that matter. We have a long-standing commitment to upholding the rule of law and the value of due process, and we will not impose our system of justice on any other country.\n\nThe fight against terrorism demands a comprehensive and coordinated effort. We will work closely with the Spanish government to root out terrorism from all corners of the globe, and we will do it in a way that respects the rule of law and the sovereignty of all nations.\n\nI appreciate the trust placed in me to lead this effort, and we're working hard to deliver on our promise to help and support our allies in this fight.

The figures that I've seen floating around in the press have, indeed, caused some confusion. Let's be clear: this is a commitment we're making to help suffering people in Africa. \n\nFirst, let me say, $15 billion is what's being committed over the course of five years, not three. And it's not a loan - these are new funds we're setting aside to help purchase vaccines, medicine, improved healthcare infrastructure, and expand programs for treating and preventing AIDS in Africa.\n\nRegarding the first-year funding, I believe it's $2.8 billion in new funding for Africa's AIDS fight in fiscal 2005, not $400 million. We're actually increasing our involvement with international partners, like the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and providing additional support for hospitals and programs in countries struggling with the disease.\n\nNow, I understand the frustration from those in the AIDS community, and I stand with them in their goal to end this epidemic. This initiative is part of a larger effort to address the HIV/AIDS crisis in Africa and around the world. And I'm committed to following through on this commitment and ensuring we get aid and assistance where it's most needed."

You're right, we did experience some challenges with the Free Trade Area of the Americas talks, but I'd argue that the Free Trade Area of the Americas was a much more complex agreement, with 34 countries at the table, as opposed to the Doha round, where we're focused on a more targeted set of issues.\n\nFirst and foremost, we've learned from the past, and we're approaching this negotiation with a different set of expectations and a different sense of priorities. We're focusing on issues that we believe are critical to our national interests, and we're working closely with our partners to build a framework that we can live with.\n\nNow, I understand that you wonder about the language barrier between Brazil and the United States, but I'd argue that our commitment to fully supporting the poorest countries in the world is genuine. We're working to reduce trade barriers and increase access to international markets. This is a real opportunity for us to make progress on issues like agriculture, non-agricultural market access, and services.\n\nWe're not setting artificial deadlines, but we are setting ambitious goals, and we're committing the resources necessary to achieve them. I'm confident that our meeting in Washington next month will be a critical step forward. We'll be working to build on the progress that's been made so far and set a clear direction for the negotiations.\n\nNow, let me be clear, we're not going to get bogged down in ideological disputes or process issues. We're focused on substance, on delivering real results for American workers and farmers, and for those in the developing world who are most in need. We're committed to a successful Doha round, and we're working hard to make it happen.\n\nNow, I'd like to add that the stakes are high, and the world community is watching. But we're not underestimating the challenges, we're not naive about the difficulties ahead. We're committed to working together with our international partners to get the job done. I've got to say, I have high hopes for the outcome of the Doha round. We can make a positive impact on people's lives around the world, and we will seize this opportunity."

The continent is rich in natural resources, abundant in labor, and endowed with significant economic potential.  But, as you said, I also recognize that many challenges lie ahead. For Africa to realize its full potential, it must have visionary, accountable, and effective leadership.\n\nTo that end, I expect to see leaders in Africa who value democracy, who promote good governance, who fight corruption, and who create opportunities for their citizens to live better lives.  Africa must also promote economic growth, trade, and investment, and work collaboratively to strengthen health systems and education.  In short, the hope for Africa is not a one-time event, but a process that requires dedication, perseverance, and the courage to take bold action.\n\nNow, on how the United States will help, we have already committed significant resources to the continent.  Through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, we've supported the fight against the spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa, and we'll continue to provide aid for that program.  We'll also continue to promote trade and investment, and to help African nations establish stable, market-based economies.\n\nBut our efforts don't stop there.  We're urging other developed nations to join us in a comprehensive initiative at the G8 to increase foreign aid to Africa by 50 percent -- from $25 billion to $37.5 billion by 2010.  We also believe it's time to negate debt owed to countries that are implementing sound economic and governance policies.\n\nNow, on my visit to Africa, (smiling) this hope the U.S. can maintain a personal relationship.  This week, in Nigeria, we'll celebrate Nigeria's rich cultural diversity.  And I'm grateful to President Olusegun Obasanjo for hosting us, discussing partnerships on trade, security, and non-proliferation, and increasing investment in the Niger Delta region.

As the President of the United States, I understand the concerns of the American people about our approach to North Korea. We've made some significant progress in our diplomatic efforts, but I am the first to admit that we're not yet where we want to be.\n\nIn the past year, we've pursued a multi-faceted strategy to address the North Korean nuclear threat. We've strengthened our alliances with South Korea and Japan, and we've maintained a strong and capable military presence in the region. We've also worked with the international community to impose tough sanctions on North Korea, and we're monitoring their illicit arms trade.\n\nNow, I know some might say that these measures haven't moved the needle with North Korea. And I'd argue that they've had an impact, although it may not be immediately evident. We've also taken steps to try to engage with the North Koreans directly, through diplomatic channels, to see if we can find a peaceful solution. We've met with them, we've tried to open lines of communication, and we've attempted to negotiate.\n\nOne area where we have made progress is in the reduction of the illicit trade, cyber warfare, conventional weapons sales of proliferation in the region. These specific areas are important to stabilizing the region. Some would argue that this isn't evidence that we've produced results on North Korea, but consider the proliferation \u2013 we can argue that if North Korea can get augmented by our activities such as, we can say that they are somewhat contained.\n\nHowever, I understand that many Americans will say we're not yet done with North Korea. And I share that view. I want to emphasize that we're committed to addressing this threat. We're working hard with our allies, and we're exploring all possible options for how to move forward. I believe that we'll continue to make progress, and I'm disappointed that North Korea hasn't made the decision to join the international community in halting their nuclear programs.\n\nNow, I can give you one example, participating in my Summit make the his Holiness the Dalai Lama occupy most of the Japanese territory that made interest of South Korea in maintaining defenses imbued many able allies in the international community."

In fact, our administration has been a long-time supporter of Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organization.\n\nHowever, our support is contingent upon several key issues. Russia needs to finalize its\tbtate alcohol and trade regulations which have been a sticking point. It's also critical that Russia addresses intellectual property protection standards, anti-dumping practices in the pipeline and agricultural sectors, as well as transparency on their treatment of foreign bribery. \n\nNow, it's true that our agricultural subsidies do represent one of the central impediments. Agricultural subsidies are a part of our domestic policy supporting American farmers. Any changes to our agricultural policies will require significant domestic support and policy adjustments. Furthermore, I have a duty to abide by the farm bill regulations passed by the U.S. Congress, which establish these subsidies.\n\nFrom day one, my administration has had discussions with the Prime Minister, Premier Putin, as well as other delegation members and have held numerous rounds of negotiations to finalize these issues. The prospect of Russia joining the WTO would serve as a key indicator of the Russian government's commitment to open, internationally harmonized economic policies.

On your question, as you know, the government of the United States is committed to protecting the Iraqi people from a brutal dictator, Saddam Hussein.

We want to see a U.N. resolution that reflects the will of the international community, to disarm Saddam through the U.N.\n\nBut let's be clear, disarmament's not going to happen on Saddam Hussein's terms. We're not going to wait for some hypothetical inspectors to gather their belongings, and maybe, maybe Saddam Hussein decides to comply. I think the people see through that. I think the American people see through that.\n\nWe're working closely with Great Britain, Australia, and several... (consults a piece of paper) ... Spain, to make a decision, to take action.

(pauses) There's no doubt we'll have an international coalition, but I want to be clear: it's with the U.N. participation that's ranked second after our core coalition.

We believe that Iran's pursuit of nuclear capabilities poses a significant threat to regional and global security, and we will continue to take all necessary steps to address this threat.\n\nNow, regarding Petrobras, I'd like to clarify that we respect the sovereignty of Brazil and the decisions that Petrobras makes as a private company. However, we also believe that it's in our national interest to discourage any investments in Iran that could potentially support the Iranian regime. Our concerns are not just about the nuclear issue, but also about Iran's human rights record, its support of terrorism, and its overall behavior in the region.\n\nRegarding the sanctions passed by the U.N., I think it's fair to say that while Iran has complied with some of the sanctions, there are still many areas where they have not met their obligations. We'll continue to work closely with our international partners to ensure that Iran adheres to its commitments under the NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty) and other international agreements.\n\nNow, I'd like to reiterate that our aim is not to dictate to Petrobras or any other company what business decisions they should make. We're simply asking them, as a responsible member of the international community, to exercise caution and to consider the potential risks of investing in a country that poses a significant threat to global stability.

We'll use all the tools at our disposal, including economic and diplomatic pressure, to convince these regimes to abandon their nuclear ambitions.\n\nNow, as for regime change, I don't think it's a viable option in these situations, at least not at this time. Our focus should be on controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and that means stopping them at any cost. The proliferation of nuclear technology to other countries poses a significant threat to global security.\n\nWithdrawing, in my opinion, is not the answer, but to bring the two countries into some sort of international framework, certainly through Six-Party Talks for North Korea, and talking with our European partners in regards to Iran, so as to have come to some acceptance and understanding of what viable state that may work together to address nuclear proliferation collectively, this would make a nice first step and more towards resolution in regards to keeping proliferation far off in the east.\n\nIn the end, the President of the United States and the U.S. government must provide tough but comprehensive, carefully planned strategy to manage risks that come with a balance of working with friends and adversaries."

I'm deeply disturbed by reports of the treatment of the Korans at Bagram Airbase. We're taking swift action to investigate the situation, and I've directed the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs to ensure that incidents like this will never happen again.\n\nLet me be clear: any alleged disrespect for the Islamic faith or its practices is unacceptable. The actions of a few individuals do not reflect the values of the majority of our service members who have risked their lives to protect the people of Afghanistan and Iraq. We're committed to upholding the values of reverence and respect for the Islamic faith.\n\nRegarding the incident in Bagram, I can tell you that we have fired all the personnel involved, and we're taking disciplinary action accordingly. But this incident, I assure you, is not representative of the values and the practices of the US military. We're not perfect, and we make mistakes, but we learn from them, and we take steps to correct them.\n\nOn the issue of Iraq, I understand that the situation remains challenging. The enemy is determined to use violence and intimidation to undermine the democratic government of Iraq. However, I'm confident that we're on the right path. We've trained hundreds of thousands of Iraqi security forces who are now taking the lead in the fight against terrorism. And our coalition partners, including Great Britain, Australia, and others, are committed to assisting the Iraqi people in building a stable and secure Iraq.\n\nI think it's unfair to compare the intensity of the insurgency today to what it was a year ago. We've made significant progress in routing out the networks and the cells that support the insurgency. However, we're not out of the woods yet. The optimism that I have about Iraq's future is based on a commitment to seeing through the process of democratic consolidation and institution-building. And I'm confident that the Iraqi people will resolve this conflict within a sovereign Iraq, with their security forces in the lead.\n\nI appreciate your asking about our commitment to helping the Iraqi people achieve a better future.

General Abizaid's assessment is that the enemy we're fighting in Iraq is not just Saddam Hussein, but also a complex mix of extremist ideologies that are using the war as an opportunity to spread their violent and hateful agendas.

The enemy we face in Iraq is a threat to Iraq's people and the world, and we're working tirelessly to disrupt and defeat them.\n\nRegarding your question about humanitarian aid to Lebanon, I want to be clear: the United States is committed to providing support to the people of Lebanon who have been affected by this crisis. Our goal is to alleviate the suffering of innocent civilians and to help the government of Lebanon restore order and security to the country.\n\nHowever, I want to clarify that our support for Israel's right to self-defense is unwavering.-Israel has been a strong ally and friend to the United States, and we will continue to provide them with the necessary support, including military equipment, to help them defend themselves against these extremist threats. These exports I've referred to as laser-guided munitions and bunker-busting bombs are indeed part of our military aid package to Israel, and we have a long-standing arrangement with Israel to provide them with military equipment.\n\nNow, let me say that our aid to Israel is not in contradiction to our commitment to aid the people of Lebanon. I see it as a necessary step to protect our ally and a means to help them defend themselves. Also, these extreme strengthening of groups are showing up  on us to further undermine our assistance that leads to less of sending to the wounded.\n\nBy supporting Israel's right to self-defense and providing humanitarian aid to Lebanon, we demonstrate our commitment to the people of that region, to peace and stability, and to freedom."

(clears throat) I appreciate your candor in assessing the situation in the Middle East, and I appreciate the opportunity to set the record straight.\n\nFirst and foremost, let me remind you that the primary motivation for our action in Iraq - Operation Iraqi Freedom - was to rid the world of Saddam Hussein, a dictator who had used and supported terrorism for over two decades, including his role in the 9/11 attacks. It was not, as I said, a response to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, although it was one of many concerns we had regarding Saddam Hussein's twisted priorities.\n\nRegarding the current situation in the region, I must correct you. The Prime Minister of Iraq, Ayad Allawi, is a man I've known for years and I believe he shares a commitment to democracy and the cause of peace in the region. True, he may have expressed disagreement with some Israeli policies, but it's also worth noting that the Iraqi government he leads has taken important steps towards closer ties with Europe, including the most successful effort yet to normalize relations between an Arab state and Israel, that is the trade agreement with Lebanon in '42 - If applied effectively, we hope they can follow these route on our warrants for Line connections &ties-Co-Lebanon and also may ease opening normal relations from separate poll Traffic Areas - we are optimistic in this real(...) \nHeck.

The Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, has been a friend and a partner in these efforts, working to bring stability and democracy to the region.\n\nAs for the issue of Israel and the surrounding region, it is clear that various Arab governments have expressed concerns about Israel's actions, which is to be expected given the longstanding Israeli-Palestinian conflict. However, it is equally evident that the US has always stood firmly in support of Israel's right to self-defense.\n\nRegarding the criticism from some Arab governments about Hezbollah, I understand their concerns about Israel's attacks on Lebanon. However, it is essential to acknowledge the facts. Hezbollah's activities are supported by Iran and Syria, which are the primary source of instability in the region.\n\nIn conclusion, the US maintains its commitment to stability, peace, and security in the region and will continue to work with countries to advance these goals, even if we don't at times agree with their positions or actions.

We've talked about a number of issues of mutual interest, particularly regarding security and democracy in the region.\n\nRegarding the matter of Hugo Chavez, we share concerns about his government. We believe that his government has engaged in unacceptable behavior. We are troubled by his continued talk of regional integration, his continued broadcasts to the region of anti-American and anti-capitalist sentiments.\n\nNow, on one hand, I do appreciate the emphasis on strengthening our security partnership with Mexico. We've committed to increase the number of border inspectors on the southern border, provide more support for the Mexican military. We're also committed to the Merida Initiative, which is designed to fight drugs and trafficking.\n\nBut at the same time, we recognize that we also have a relationship with Venezuela, and that's why we're trying to engage with them in a productive dialogue. We believe that it's in our interest to have a more constructive relationship with Mexico on one hand and a constructive dialogue with Venezuela on the other, and that's what we're trying to do.\n\nNow, I appreciate your question, and I think we've dealt with it unmistakenly, and I think it's been a very productive meeting with President Calderon."

But to address your question directly: We have heavily involved the Quartet on the Middle East in this process, which includes the United Nations, the European Union, Russia, and us, the United States. And we have provided the Quartet with a role in implementing and verifying the disengagement in Gaza, and we'll continue to work with the Quartet to ensure that both sides meet their obligations.\n\nNow, I'll tell you what we are doing in terms of monitoring. We have several strategies to monitor the situation. Under the roadmap, we've tasked the Prime Minister of Israel and the Palestinian Authority with establishing the necessary mechanisms for security, for withdrawal, and for economic development. The U.S., the Quartet, and other international partners will be closely monitoring those efforts.\n\nBeyond that, we've taken several steps to ensure the Israelis and the Palestinians meet their obligations under the roadmap. First, we've deployed American observers in the Gaza Strip to monitor the disengagement process, which began in earnest in September. These observers are verifying the dismantling of Israeli settlements and military sites. Second, we've also deployed troops to secure the crossings more efficiently and bring in the humanitarian and commercial supplies. This shows this commitment to enforcement we're willing to take to try to make progress.\n\nWe're also working closely with other international partners to provide technical assistance to help rebuild and to help re-establish infrastructure in Gaza. This includes the participation of international organizations and the provision of foreign aid. To me, it remains a diplomatic effort, that requires sustained international support."

First and foremost, I want to express my deep concern for the recent violence and murders, including the tragic loss of three Salvadoran Congress members. These acts of violence are unacceptable and a clear indication of the gravity of the threat that drug trafficking poses to regional stability.\n\nThe United States is fully committed to cooperation with the governments of Guatemala and El Salvador to tackle this complex issue. We understand that a comprehensive strategy is necessary to combat the flow of narcotics, as well as the violence and instability it breeds. That's why we're working closely with them to strengthen their institutions, improve their capacity to investigate and prosecute, and enhance their border security.\n\nWe're providing significant support, including training for law enforcement, military assistance, and intelligence sharing, as well as funding for economic development programs to reduce the underlying poverty and inequality that fuels the trade. We believe that this multi-faceted approach will help to undermine the cartels' ability to operate in the region.\n\nRegarding the Colombia Plan, I've been briefed on the proposal and we're considering it carefully. The plan has some merit, but we need to carefully evaluate how it can be effectively implemented in the Guatemalan context. We'll be working closely with our Guatemalan and Salvadoran partners to ensure that any approach we take is tailored to their needs and priorities.\n\nNow, I understand that our latest reports may have raised some concerns about the effectiveness of our efforts in this area. Let me be clear: we take those concerns seriously, and we're committed to improving our results. However, it's essential to understand that the fight against drugs is a long-term and complex challenge that requires sustained effort and patience. I'm confident that by working together with our partners in the region, we can make progress and reduce the flow of narcotics and the violence they fuel.\n\nWe'll continue to do everything in our power to support our friends in Guatemala and El Salvador, and to help bring about a safe, secure, and prosperous future for the people of the region.\n\nThank you. \n\n(pauses to adjust glasses)\n\nI'd like to note, as well, that it's interesting to see that [administrator] necessities declare scenarios along states weaken if implementation has been foregone, then tells the truth and updates changes scenarios grant so the U.S strength strains ties."

The situation in Cuba and our policies regarding the island nation remain a key priority for my administration.\n\nFirst, regarding Cuba, our policy of isolating the Castro regime remains in effect. As you know, we believe the regime's human rights record is deplorable, and we will continue to support the Cuban people in their aspirations for freedom and democracy. Our embargo on Cuba, which is based on the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Helms-Burton Act, will continue until the Cuban government takes tangible steps towards democratic reforms and respect for human rights.\n\nRegarding our policy in Europe and other countries, we will continue to work with international partners to coordinate our efforts to promote democratic values, human rights, and the rule of law around the world. The U.S. will not support any country or organization that seeks to undermine these principles.\n\nNow, regarding Plan Colombia, that's a program aimed at strengthening the Colombian government's counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism efforts, as well as promoting stability and economic development in Colombia. We will continue to support this plan, as it is a key component of our broader anti-drug strategy in the hemisphere.\n\nIn fact, this past year, the United States provided over $700 million in support for Plan Colombia, and we've also committed $860 million in additional funding for the next year. But we're not alone in this effort. Our partner countries in the region, including Brazil, Mexico, and several other nations, have also contributed resources and personnel to the effort.\n\nOur goal in Colombia is to help the Colombian people build a more secure, prosperous, and more democratic society. We will continue to work with the Colombian government to ensure that the funds we provide are used effectively and efficiently, and that they contribute to the long-term stability and security of the region.

You know, as a nation, we've got a responsibility to support the institution of marriage, which has been the foundation of our society for so long. Now, the Supreme Court's decision in California was about the proper role of government in defining marriage between a man and a woman. But, as you pointed out, that's left many questions about the children in these situations.\n\nAs a nation, we are committed to supporting all families, and that includes the children. We need to recognize that many children are living in loving, homosexual households, and we need to provide these families with the support and resources they need to thrive.\n\nI've been proud of the steps my administration's taken to address this issue. We've strengthened our commitment to supporting families and children through programs like the No Child Left Behind Act, and we've increased funding for adoption and child welfare services.\n\nHowever, I've also been clear about my position on same-sex marriage. I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman. I understand that this view may not be shared by all Americans, and I respect that. But we need to respect the laws and institutions that have been established.\n\nNow, I know this is a complex issue, and there are no easy answers.

    "gen_response": "Thank you, and thank you, Bob Woodward from the Washington Post... ah, I'm glad to take your question.  First, the right of the British to consider a military option in the face of this serious situation, I think that's a decision for them to make. We value our strategic relationship with the United Kingdom, and their willingness to work closely with us in this crisis situation is evident, and I think they understand that as well as the risks and the implications of any military action. I don't want to speculate on what their plans may or may not be, but we're working closely with the British to help facilitate the release of their personnel.\n\nNow, let me address the second part of your question. As you know, we took very swift action in the aftermath of 9/11 to ensure the security of our nation, and the safety of our personnel, particularly our military personnel around the world. Anytime a service member of our nation is taken hostage, we consider it a grave threat to our national security, and we take swift action to protect our personnel and secure their release. But, you know, we've got to work through diplomatic channels first to achieve the release of our personnel, and then we act accordingly.\n\nRegarding the five Iranians who were captured in Irbil in January, the Iraqis turned them over to us, and we're holding them for a time as our assessment indicates. I would consider any additional acts of terrorism linked to these five individuals before any trade possibilities through diplomatic channels occur. We understand the value of diplomacy as we pursue the resolution of this hostage situation, and we're engaged in intense diplomatic efforts with our allies in the region to resolve this peacefully.\n\nBut, to answer your final question directly, there's nothing I'd commit to at this moment, and I'd say that, and speculation mainly otherwise besides the diplomatic efforts we make through various channels and choosing when the time is right for discussing any kinds of exchanges."

I believe the Democrats have shown that they're willing to take an all-or-nothing approach to governance, and that's not leadership.\n\nI want to assure the American people that I will continue to stand strong and make decisions that will secure the American people, and I appreciate the support I've received from the American people for that, and for my approaches, which, as you said, really have paid off.\n\nAs for my relations with the Democratic leadership, I've been able to build a relationship with some like Speaker Pelosi and others to get important business done.

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question.  I appreciate your diligence on this issue.  The stem cell issue is a complex and deeply personal one, and I've given it a lot of thought as you might expect.  My meeting with the Pope was certainly a valuable opportunity for me to discuss these issues with His Holiness on a personal level, as well as to inform myself on the moral and ethical underpinnings that guide our thinking on this matter.\n\nWhile His Holiness was clear in his opposition to the creation of stem cells for the purpose of research, I should note that this was not a major point of contention between us in our discussion.  In fact, we touched on various points related to human embryonic stem cell research, including the constitutional and scientific implications.\n\nNow, in terms of the Pope's focus on existing stem cells, I think his view is that, if there are alternatives, that we should exhaust those avenues before using embryonic stem cells.  I agree that we need to be judicious and responsible in our research, but I'm also mindful of the urgency of the challenges we're facing in medicine and the potential for significant medical breakthroughs from stem cell research.\n\nThat being said, I've tasked Secretary Spellings to look into key alternatives, one of which would involve obtaining stem cells without obliterating the embryo.  Options such as adult stem cell research hold a lot of promise, but will it have the potential that I believe it's worth pursuing.\n\nAnother option that we're looking at is bipartisan legislation that would allow us to use an unlimited number of fetal tissue through organ donations. And finally, there are ongoing research developments in the area of fetal stem cells that some see as possibly more flexible than embryonic stem cells.\n\nIn this place in our history, it's a wide range of options we're looking at to address this complex issue, and I have yet to make a decision on which option to choose, one that may, in fact, change over time."

    "gen_response": "Good afternoon, thank you for that second question. I'm glad you mentioned two very important issues.\n\nFirst, with regard to the missile defense system, let me tell you that I've said before and I'll say again, cooperation is always the first choice. The 1972 ABM treaty was a relic of the Cold War, and I believe we're in a new era. Russia and I had discussions on this very issue prior to 9/11, and I made it clear that I was willing to work with them. However, the fact remains that we did have a commitment to protecting America and our allies. And we've made significant progress on this issue.\n\nNow, as you know, North Korea's Taepodong-II missile test in August 1998 made it clear that, quote, \"rogues will do what they will.\" And then, of course, the attack on the USS Belles on January 31, 1998, by a North Korean submarine for our sailors made it clear that they're trying to expand their capabilities. So we've got to take this threat seriously.\n\nNow, regarding the coalition and Russia, we're in new territory here. When I said cooperation is always the first choice, I'm not naive to the realities of the world. We have to think about our security, our national security. If Russia doesn't agree to these terms, the facts still remain the same: North Korea and Iran still pose a threat. We have to protect America.\n\nNow, about your second question... (pausing) I wish we had more support from the Muslim world. When I was in Islam's birthplace, I was telling the people there: this is not a war against Islam; it's a war against terrorism. They seem to believe the same, and I feel confident that they're with us. But criticizing us is always easy. Support is harder.\n\nIn fact, I'm grateful for support from the rich moderate Muslim world and Christian churches in the Middle East. But, I wish we had more support from rich countries from other groups, and also from moderate voices everywhere."

    "gen_response": "(pausing for a moment) Well, I appreciate your willingness to cut to the chase and directly ask me a question. I'll do my best to answer it.\n\nI appreciate your request for clarification on the use of the term \"executed.\" I've used that term to describe the beheading of James Foley by the terrorists who are fighting against us in Iraq and Syria, and I used it to convey the brutality and the wickedness of the act. It's a stark reminder of the enemy we're facing, and I will continue to make sure that the American people understand the nature of this enemy.\n\nMoving to your broader question, it's fair to say that, at times, we've had challenges in our relationships with certain countries, including some of our traditional allies. However, I would argue that our unshakeable commitment to the freedom and security of the American people has sometimes taken us down a path that didn't align with the views of all of our allies.\n\nThroughout our history, we've made difficult decisions, and not everyone has agreed with them. But we've always acted with the best interest of the American people in mind. I look at what we did in the Balkans in the 1990s. I know that some would say that we shouldn't have intervened in Kosovo, but I believe that, in that case, we stood up for basic human rights and helped to stop genocide.\n\nSimilarly, when we went to Afghanistan after 9/11, it was to root out the perpetrators of the terror attack on our homeland. We had no choice. We were at war, and we had to act. Other countries didn't necessarily agree with our actions, but I think it's fair to say that they understood the imperative of dealing with al-Qaeda.\n\nRegarding Iraq, I know there are many Opinions on the decision to take Saddam Hussein out. However, I firmly believe that, in the long run, it's a better world with a free and more stable Iraq, rather than one that was ruled by a brutal dictator who posed a threat to both the region and the world.\n\nNow, I know these actions didn't always result in the support of all of our allies, but I genuinely believe they were necessary to protect this country."

The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs are providing me with a mixed bag of information on, you know, the capabilities and readiness levels of the Iraqi security forces. And I appreciate their candor in doing so.\n\nWhat I said in the Rose Garden, I was given the information that there were a significant number of Iraqi battalions that were increasingly independent and capable of operating with minimal American assistance. And that's what I reported to the American people.\n\nNow, what General Abizaid and General Casey said on Capitol Hill, they're looking at it from a different perspective. They're looking at it from a qualified prospective. They're saying we still have got a lot of work to do to build the capacity of the Iraqi army. And I respect those views.\n\nYou see, it's a complex situation. It's a situation that's been complicated by the fact that a lot of the Iraqi security forces are not, quote, 'battle-ready', quote, 'battalions'. A lot of them are units that are still learning and still growing, and still need a lot of help from us.\n\nSo I wouldn't say that there's a contradiction between what I said and what General Abizaid and General Casey said. I think we're just looking at it from a different perspective. And I think the American people understand that we're in this for the long haul. We're in it to build a free and stable Iraq. And that's what we're going to continue to do.\n\nI think it's, uh, worth pointing out that we're making progress. We're making progress, despite the obstacles. The insurgents are trying to derail our efforts, but we're not going to let them. We're not going to let them stop us from achieving our objectives. And we're going to continue to provide any support necessary to the Iraqi troops to allow them to build their capacity.\n\nI look forward to speaking with you all again tomorrow, thank you."

    "gen_response": "I appreciate your question, and I understand your concern about the current state of the economy. Now, I'd like to remind you that even with the significant uncertainty and challenges we're facing today, this economy has actually created almost 7 million new jobs since I took office.\n\nThose jobs are the result of carefully designed tax cuts, which helped to unleash the entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial spirit of the American people. Our tax policies have allowed businesses to keep more of their own earnings, to invest in their businesses, and to create new opportunities for workers.\n\nNow, I know you're right that we face a genuine challenge in dealing with the budget deficit, and I agree with that. But we were facing a large budget deficit when I took office, and for the first time in history, our government has gone from running budget deficits of over $150 billion to running an actual budget surplus for a couple of years. The problem now, of course, is not the kind of budget deficit we had then; it's a consequence of extraordinary and unforeseen expenses associated with the war, with homeland security measures, and the aftermath of 9/11.\n\nOur tax cuts, I can tell you, helped spur that growth in the early years after I came into office. The economy grew over four consecutive quarters - the longest period of sustained economic growth in a generation. We've also seen reductions in corporate taxes, which have added dollars to investors' pockets, which in turn have further boosted employment.\n\nIn these trying times, I think it's essential to recognize the scope and the impact of fiscal responsibility on the economy. I think it's also critical to recognize that, under our administration, we've added regulations necessary to confront the challenges we face in the global economy.\n\nNow, about other approaches - well, I'm a firm believer in tax reform and knowing what works and what doesn't. The evidence is clear that not only do our tax cuts help businesses and people prosper, but they also help stimulate the economy. That said, I'm not opposed to talking about other solutions to the economic challenges we face, and I'll work with Congress to come up with creative ways to balance those goals.\n\nI believe that our current tax cuts - the ones that have been working - should stay in place, as they stimulate growth in the economy and allow people to invest their own money. But the situation is delicate and I am open to finding innovative, meaningful, ways to hold line on the budget and find solutions that truly enhance America's economy."

That's a clear example of the U.N.'s bureaucratic flaws and waste. But we also had our concerns about U.N. performance, especially Secretary General Kofi Annan, about how they handled the situation in Iraq.\n\nIn terms of our moral standing, I believe that the United States has taken actions to bring freedom to a people who were under the grip of Saddam Hussein, and denied democracy to their people, to the women, and to the people in general and we've had some outstanding success in doing so. \n\nRegarding whether the U.S. is held to a higher standard, well, history would say that every great power has been held to a higher standard, especially in this age, and rightly so. And let me tell you, it's a standard we're willing to uphold and we'll continue to uphold that standard with our own values, which include the desire for freedom, justice, and human rights and those values are in line with our founding principles of this great nation.\n\nYou know, when it comes to freedom, it's not a partisan issue, it's not even a domestic issue; it's America's issue. And we will not apologize for spreading those values of freedom around the world and we will continue to promote democracy, we will continue to promote human rights in the world.\n\nAsk yourself, what would you say to the people in Free Iraq today? I think they will say that their country is better off now than it was before we intervened, and if that's the case, then we have stood for what is right.\n\nHowever, our ultimate objective and that of the international authorities is to work together to make sure the success of Iraq will go hand in hand with the strength of the international system and U.N. where United Nations will be able to acquire better performance along with the idea that U.N. should more effectively act as the implication of this global democracy and act effectively.\n\nIt is a tough question to answer, but those people of Iraq who we free from the grip, the peril of Saddam Hussein and under reliable security will encourage you to think it was that right thing to do."

    "gen_response": "Good afternoon, folks. I appreciate the question. Let me tell you, I'm committed to making sure our intelligence system is robust, efficient, and effective in protecting the American people. And to do that, we need a strong director of National Intelligence.\n\nJohn Negroponte is a highly respected public servant with a distinguished career in foreign policy, diplomacy, and, as you know, intelligence. His role as the Director of National Intelligence will be to oversee and coordinate our intelligence efforts across the government, not to control any particular agency, not even the CIA. His job will be to bring together the best minds and the best information from all the various agencies to make sure we've got a cohesive, unified approach to our intelligence.\n\nNow, I understand that the budget process can be contentious, and I'm sure Deputy Secretary of Defense, Paul Wolfowitz, and his team at the Pentagon will work closely with Ambassador Negroponte to ensure a smooth transition and to make sure the interests of national security are met. But make no mistake, this is not a power struggle between the DNI and the Pentagon. This is about making America safer, and that's our top priority.\n\nAs for Ambassador Negroponte's office, he'll be working out of the Executive Office of the President, in a suite in the Old Executive Office Building. That's just a short walk from the Oval Office, so he'll have easy access to me and our national security team. In fact, he'll be meeting with me on a regular basis to provide me with the most important intelligence, and he'll also be working closely with my national security team to ensure we've got the best possible information to make decisions regarding our national security.\n\nSo, I'm committed to making sure our intelligence system is effective, and I've got complete confidence in Ambassador Negroponte's ability to get the job done. Thank you."

First, let me correct you - it was Hizballah's brutal and destructive attacks on Israeli territory and the kidnapping of two Israeli soldiers that started this conflict, not the other way around. We've made it clear from the beginning that the goal of our efforts is to convene a lasting and durable cease-fire, not simply to allow Hizballah to rearm and reconstitute.\n\nNow, regarding the deployment of the UN peacekeeping force, we're working closely with the international community to ensure that the force is robust and effective in achieving its objectives. The key principles guiding our efforts are clear: disarming Hizballah, supporting the Lebanese government in exerting control over its territory, and preventing the smuggling of arms into Lebanon.\n\nTo that end, we expect the peacekeeping force to work closely with the Lebanese government to enforce the terms of the cease-fire, including the disarmament of Hizballah. We also expect the Lebanese government to take concrete steps to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1559, which requires the disarmament of all armed militias within Lebanon, including Hizballah.\n\nLet me be clear: a disarmament process that doesn't dissolve into pieces is those who are set up - unfortunate for them, good for Lebanon, good for the stability of the Middle East. And for us we will push Israel, the international community - we will do everything we can to make sure Israel's security is protected, for a lasting long-term resolution to occur.\n\nI'm confident that together with key partners, like the UN and key regional governments, we can establish a lasting peace and a more stable future for the people of Lebanon. But it requires more than just a UN force presence \u2013 it requires strong and determined action by all parties involved."

Now, I'm aware of the concerns that the Mexican producers have raised about the opening up of the livestock and agriculture sectors. And I want to assure you, we're listening to those concerns, but we also believe that this agreement's going to be a win-win for all three countries.\n\nNow, I will say that we're open to negotiations and discussions to address these concerns. However, we also want to make sure that we don't lose sight of what we set out to do here, which is to create a fair and open market for all parties involved. So I wouldn't say that we're going to leave it for a later date, but we're going to continue to work through these issues in a collaborative manner.\n\nAnd let me tell you, we're very optimistic that we can get this done, and we're going to keep on negotiating and working hard to address those concerns.

I appreciate your observation about the nature of the violence we're facing in that country. I share your concern that the enemy we're fighting in Iraq is comprised of criminal elements and foreign terrorist groups like al-Qaeda in Iraq, but we cannot deny that there are also elements of sectarian strife and the ongoing struggle between certain groups in Iraq seeking power.\n\nIt's my judgment, however, that these groups are not the product of the post-Saddam vacuum that we've created, but rather a pre-existing condition exacerbated by the terrorist groups that have exploited that situation.\n\nAs for your question regarding American forces in combat, I can tell you that while we're conducting a significant training and advisory role, we have engaged\u2014limited engagements with [INAUDIBLE] where we've taken casualties. Our commitment to Iraq remains steadfast in terms of our support for stability and democracy in the region.\n\nRegarding the scale of our engagement, we are not retreating from our responsibilities in Iraq. We're drawing down significantly in the coming months as the Iraqi military gains strength.\n\nNow, I'd like to address the situation in Tibet. The reports of a crackdown in Tibet are indeed disturbing. The US will always stand by its values of human rights and peaceful resolution, and we're urging the Chinese government to work towards a unity based on the interests of the Tibetan people.\n\nWe've always believed that China's rise to economic and diplomatic power provides opportunities for our countries to work more closely together, but with assumed greater freedom for its people and respect for universal values that we've come to identify as central to our global campaign against terrorism."

We cannot and will not raid the Social Security Trust Fund to finance new programs.\n\nIn fact, I've been working very closely with Congress to try to strengthen Social Security, not weaken it. After all, Social Security is a sacred trust, it's a commitment that we make to our seniors. We must live up to it.\n\nNow, I agree our defense posture needs to be modernized and updated, which is why I've called for a comprehensive review of our national security strategy.  Missile defense is part of that, but we need to evaluate the wisdom and feasibility of pursuing that. But in terms of new weapons systems, those are long-term investments, not things that should be paid for out of the Social Security Trust Fund.\n\nBesides, the budget I submitted has already been evaluated and passed by the OMB, it sets out clear priorities for national security, and also for long-term investments in areas like education, health care, and tax relief. These priorities require firm budgetary foundations, not offerings drawn from programs like Social Security or Medicare.\n\nThe fact is, I will present budget proposals that will keep federal spending in line with growth of the economy, start again to improve Social Security and Medicare, rather than send it into bankruptcy down the road. I want to honor this commitment to those who've worked hard for it.\n\nNow I might consider adjustments as part of the discretionary budget for the defense, still looking out the range of all of our programs but always, as best as possible in accordance with the principles that guided us throughout, trying to ensure that we've got an overall fiscal balance.'"

You know, the most important contribution China can make to this here campaign, in my judgment, would be to do everything in their power to help us prevent the transfer of the deadly technologies necessary for weapons of mass destruction, especially chemical, biological, and nuclear, to these terrorist organizations.\n\nYou know, we share a common enemy, I believe that, in the war on terror. And we believe that if we can get rid of the dangers of this type of weaponry being transferred to these folks, that it'll be a major step forward for our respective countries, for the world, and in our collective security.\n\nAs for assurances, today's meetings have been quite productive. I had the opportunity to discuss this very issue at length with the Chinese leadership. They've assured me that they share my commitment to this cause, that they understand the gravity of this threat, and that they're willing to work closely with us to prevent the transfer of these technologies.\n\nNow, we're talking about real actions, not just words. We're talking about enforcement of U.N. Resolution 1540, work to strengthen their export control systems, identification and detention of proliferators. These are concrete steps, and I believe the Chinese are committed to taking them.\n\nThere's still much work to be done, but I'm optimistic about the future. I think that our meeting today shows that we're making progress in this fight against terrorism and these weapons of mass destruction.

Let me tell you, the agreement we're about to sign in Moscow is a significant step forward in reducing the number of nuclear warheads we both possess. There's no question about that. However, I share your concern about the potential for proliferation.\n\nWe've made it clear to President Putin, and we've made it clear in our legislation back home, that we must ensure that the materials from these dismantled warheads don't fall into the wrong hands. We've got several initiatives underway to address this very concern.\n\nFirst, we're working closely with Russia, as well as with other former Soviet republics, to secure and consolidate these materials. We're talking about highly enriched uranium, plutonium \u2013 the very materials that a terrorist could use to make a nuclear bomb.\n\nWe're committing $10 billion to this effort over the next 10 years to help Russia properly secure these facilities, including uranium and plutonium storage and disposition facilities. We'll also be increasing security at these sites, including training and equipping the Russian personnel to handle these materials safely.\n\nNow, I understand some folks may express doubts, and I'm glad to have an opportunity to clarify these concerns. By reducing our warheads, we can assure the public and the world that we're moving in the right direction \u2013 reducing the numbers, reducing the threat, and making it harder for proliferators.\n\nIran, for example, sees our leadership in this area through our secure storage and disposition facilities, and it sends a message to that existing proliferation hotbed that America is watching and working to secure the sources."

I appreciate the opportunity to express my thoughts on the excellent relationship between the Czech Republic and the United States. \n\nAs you know, NATO has proven to be a vital strategic alliance for the security of Europe, and the Czech Republic has been a valued member of that alliance. We've strengthened our partnership, and I'm proud of the progress we've made in defense cooperation and on counter-terrorism efforts.\n\nYou're right, the global landscape has changed since the Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999. But, I want to assure you that our partnership remains strong, and our commitment to each other has only deepened. The Czech Republic's decision to participate in the war in Afghanistan alongside the United States and other NATO allies has demonstrated the country's determination to stand by us in defending common values of freedom, security, and democracy.\n\nWhile our bilateral relationship has indeed evolved over time, our shared interests and goals have remained constant. We continue to cooperate on issues critical to our mutual security, including counter-terrorism, non-proliferation, and missile defense.\n\nIn light of the situation in Iraq, I can assure you that the Czech Republic is a highly valued ally, and we appreciate their contributions to the coalition. Their participation in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan has proven that they are a capable and committed partner. We certainly value the contributions from the Czech Republic and are in constant communication with their leadership regarding our joint efforts to defeat terrorism and bring about stability to the region.\n\nAs for our expectations, I have every confidence in the Czech Republic's willingness to stand with us in times of need. I believe in the resilience and determination of the Czech people, and I appreciate their solidarity with the United States. They've made significant contributions to the cause of freedom, and I have no doubt that, if called upon, they'll continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with us."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you. Let me address each of your questions, and I appreciate the opportunity to share my thoughts on these important matters.\n\nFirst, I still believe strongly in the goal of a Palestinian state. We made progress with the Roadmap for Peace, which laid out the steps necessary for Palestinian statehood. We were committed to supporting Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian leadership in their efforts to build a democratic, stable, and secure state. I also made a commitment to work with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to move forward with the Roadmap and to support the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nHowever, the achievements under the Oslo Accords and the Roadmap were unfortunately undermined by the election of Hamas in 2006. Hamas' rejection of Israel's existence and its refusal to abide by the principles of democracy and human rights made it difficult for us to proceed with the Palestinian state as envisioned.\n\nNow, that being said, my position remains that I still believe a sovereign Palestinian state is our goal. I think it is in the best interests of both the Palestinian people and the state of Israel for there to be a two-state solution. The United States remains committed to supporting that goal.\n\nOn your second question, I agree that the time may have come for us to consider setting timetables for achieving the final status issues. The Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have been ongoing for too long, and too many promises have been made but not fulfilled. I think it is the obligation of all parties to show progress and to demonstrate a commitment to reaching a final agreement.\n\nWe must be creative in our approach. I think that everyone should recognize that there is not one ideal position, and compromise is necessary for the sake of finding a two-state solution. Ultimately, the status of Jerusalem, the borders between Israel and Palestine, the security arrangements, and the issue of refugees are all part of the final negotiations.\n\nWe should consider setting timetables and deadlines for achieving these final status issues, perhaps after the exchange of land for the Palestinian state in the West Bank, creating a contiguous, and perceptible, and feasible Palestinian state."

    "gen_response": "(clears throat) Thank you for that question. I appreciate the candor in which you framed it. I'd like to set the record straight. From the very beginning, our administration has been committed to the task of countering the threat of nuclear proliferation. And as the events unfolded in the Israeli incident, it became clear that the situation was more complex than initially met the eye.\n\nWhile I agree that some of my comments initially may have seemed opaque, I can assure you that our administration has been vigorously addressing this crisis behind the scenes. As for the declassification of information, I'd like to explain that it was a deliberate decision, driven by a series of developments that led us to believe it was in the best interest of national security to release the information.\n\n(reaches for a folder)\nThe administration had, over a period of time, continually updated our understanding of the situation through joint U.S.-Israel intelligence efforts. As we gained a clearer picture of the involvement of North Korea, we made the decision to share that information with our allies and partners, including the Congress.\n\nIt was not the intention of the administration to withhold information from the Capitol Hill lawmakers; to the contrary, our efforts are guided by a commitment to transparency while ensuring the sensitivities of our nation's security. Had we prematurely disclosed this information, we could have risked undermining our allies' trust in our ability to secure sensitive information.\n\nAs the information became clearer within the administration, we advised key congressional committees on an as-needed basis. In fact, many members of the intelligence teams, outside of the public eye, had been briefed on this issue well before the public release. The careful orchestration was that of making sure the essential components \u2013 diplomatic corps, intelligence agencies and the U.S. Congress \u2013 were on the same page in controlling the narrative of this pivotal challenge our nation faced.\n\nWe appreciate the concerns of our lawmakers and will continue to work with them to build a unified and strong alliance working towards stability in this region. Our federal system works best when all of its branches enjoy trustful dealings with each other, adhering always to an unwavering resolve to defend our nation against the clear threats that pose existential danger to U.S. allies and interests worldwide."

I have spoken with my fellow candidates about this, and I think we can do a better job.\n\nNow, the noose incident at the college campus is disturbing, to say the least.  I've spoken to my Attorney General about this as well.  These kinds of incidents are not representative of the American people, but they are a serious reminder of the challenges we still face in our society.\n\nAs a nation, we have made great progress on civil rights, but we still have work to do.  We must remain vigilant in promoting understanding, tolerance, and respect for one another.  And I'm committed to working with all Americans to achieve this goal.\n\nIn terms of what we've done, just last year, we opened a new office of Civil Rights Diversion and Intervention, to reduce the backlog of civil rights cases.  And we've also increased funding for the No Child Left Behind Act, which is helping to improve educational opportunities for minority students.\n\nBut I also understand that perceptions are everything, and we need to be more effective in showcasing our commitment to diversity and inclusion.   I will continue to work to make sure that America remains a beacon of hope and opportunity for all its citizens, and that we stay true to the ideals of fairness and equality that have always guided our great nation.\n\nThat's my take on this.

This initiative is crucial in helping the Colombian people combat the scourge of narco-terrorists and to bring stability to that country. The United States has a significant stake in a peaceful and stable Colombia, and we believe that Plan Colombia offers us a way to address the challenges facing President Pastrana and the Colombian people.\n\nNow, while I understand some of the concerns about the possible role of the U.S. military, let me be clear: our commitment is to support the Colombian military and police in counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism efforts, not to insert direct U.S. military personnel into Colombia. We will work closely with the Colombian leadership and the Government of Colombia to ensure that their concerns are taken into account and that our shared goals are mutually beneficial.\n\nI am confident that this approach will yield positive results, not just for Colombia, but for the region.

And we believe that technology developed by European companies, Italian companies, and others can be an important part of this effort.\n\nWe do have a commitment, a shared commitment, in Europe to develop and deploy missile defense capabilities that can protect our nations from the spread of ballistic missile threats. Joint research and development, as well as purchase decisions, are jointly made through NATO defense planning processes.

However, the situation with the police is indeed a concern, and I agree that they've got some significant challenges ahead of them.\n\nBut here's the thing. We've made significant investments in the new government of Iraq, and we believe that Prime Minister Maliki and his team have a commitment to reform and to making sure that the rule of law is upheld. The issue is not just about personalities; it's about institutions and policies.\n\nWe're working closely with the Iraqi government to help them improve their institutions, to train their security forces, and to help them build a stronger, more stable country. This is a long-term effort. We've been here for nearly three years, and we've seen significant progress.\n\nNow, I know there are still many challenges ahead. But I believe that the Iraqi people want to be free, and they want to be able to govern themselves. They want to build a country that's stable, prosperous, and at peace with its neighbors. And I believe that with our continued support and partnership, we can help them achieve those goals.\n\nYou know, I've been a Governor of a state, I've been a President of the United States, and I've been in politics for a long time. I know that progress is not always linear. Sometimes it's two steps forward and a step back. But I believe that the progress we've made in Iraq is significant, and I'm confident that with continued American leadership and partnership, we can help the Iraqi people build a better future for themselves.\n\nOne final thing \u2013 as Commander-in-Chief, I'm constantly assessing the situation on the ground, and if I don't believe that our objectives are achievable, I won't hesitate to adjust our approach.

Freedom of the press is enshrined in our Constitution, and we've had a long history of a vibrant, independent press that has held those in power accountable.\n\nNow, you're right to point out that we do have concerns about press freedom in Russia, and I've expressed those concerns to President Putin. I believe a free press is essential for a functioning democracy, and it's only when the press is free that people can really hold their leaders to account.\n\nRegarding the issue of journalists in the United States, I think it's essential to distinguish between criticism and abuse of press freedom. Criticism, I believe, is an essential part of a functioning democracy. It's also essential in our country for the public to have a robust debate and for the press to hold us accountable.\n\nAs for firings of journalists, I'll tell you that it's not uncommon for journalists to change employers or be let go for a variety of reasons, including budget cuts or a change in editorial direction. But let me be clear, in America, we have a strong tradition of a free press, and I don't think it's the same dynamic as what's been going on in Russia, where there have been alleged abuses of journalism, where there have been instances of intimidation and harassment.\n\nPresident Putin and I have a good relationship, and I bring up these issues with him when I see fit.

I like people to know the truth, and I've always tried to run this administration with integrity.\n\nNow, in terms of what I learned from this investigation, I've learned a lot, and I want to tell you what I've learned. What I've learned is that there were a lot of problems in the way we vetted information in this administration. We relied too heavily on intelligence that turned out to be faulty, and we didn't do a good enough job in scrutinizing the information we were getting from various sources.\n\nIn terms of Karl Rove, as I've said before, I'm comfortable with what Karl has said about his involvement in this case.

And I appreciate the, uh, oversight, if you will, of this investigation has helped to clarify that.\n\nHowever, I do acknowledge that we did use information from Valerie Plame that was classified, and that was wrong. We should not have done that. I told Karl to cooperate fully with the investigation, and he did.\n\nNow, do I think that some credibility has been lost in this process? I do. I'm a big believer in transparency, and I wish the administration had done a better job in communicating with the American people about the challenges we were facing. But I want to assure you that I've learned a great deal from this experience, and we're taking steps to make sure that it never happens again.\n\nWe're committed to restoring the faith of the American people, and I've done that by working with this investigation, by being forthcoming with the American people. We're committed to continuing to be as open and transparent as possible, because that's the right thing to do.\n\nSo, to answer your question, yes, I do have some work to do to rebuild credibility. But I'm confident that we can do it. We've served this nation honorably, and we will continue to do so."

I'll tell you, our goal is to complete a free trade agreement, sometimes called the Free Trade Area of the Americas, by the 2005 target date. That's still the objective. And I'm convinced we can do that.\n\nNow, I understand that President Cardoso has a preference for Mercosur, and I respect that. In fact, I believe in the free trade spirit of Mercosur as well. My administration is committed to working closely with President Cardoso and other countries in the Americas to achieve a comprehensive free trade agreement that will benefit all our people.\n\nWe'll have -- I think this is the fifth or sixth meeting with President Cardoso, and I'm confident we'll make progress. We'll talk about the aspects that Brazil is concerned with, and we'll work together to find common ground. Our team's been working closely with the Brazilians to identify areas where we need to work together, and I'm optimistic we'll be able to make progress towards the 2005 goal."

First, let me say that we are indeed concerned about the situation in Macedonia, and we continue to support the efforts of the people of Macedonia to establish a stable and peaceful government.  I'm proud to say that the State Department has been working closely with our allies and partners in the region to help resolve the issues that are arising.\n\nNow, regarding your question on why NATO hasn't taken a more, shall we say, direct role, I would say it's a matter of timing and of strategy.  The people of Macedonia are working through a very difficult and complex situation, and we want to support them without in any way interfering with their sovereignty or their ability to resolve their own problems.\n\nHowever, we are committed to helping North Macedonia through NATO's capacity building programs, which are aimed at strengthening their institutions, their security forces, and their ability to defend themselves and uphold the rule of law.  We're also providing assistance in areas like counter-terrorism, democratic institution building, and economic development.\n\nWhile we understand the need for military assistance, we believe that small, targeted and specific actions are most effective in this case. A large-scale military presence would only muddle a delicate situation and could actually work against the efforts we're trying to support.\n\nNATO has also taken up the invitation of North Macedonia to begin Membership Action Plan, MAP talks, a critical step on the path toward NATO membership.  We are committed to supporting North Macedonia in their effort to become a full-fledged member of the alliance."

We know that we have shared interests, and this partnership is vital to the safety of not only the American people, but to the world.\n\nNow, I understand your question, and I want to make it clear: we object to the countries that sell technology that could be used to develop weapons of mass destruction, and if that countries do that, they're not with us in the War on Terror.  We make no bones about it.  But at the same time, we're glad to work with Russia on our shared interests.  It's not an \"eyeball to eyeball\" confrontation, but it's a relationship of give-and-take and finding common ground.\n\nWe're working hard to increase the chances of getting chemical, biological and nuclear materials that could be used harmfully in the hands of terrorists, off the black market.  And so, let's say it clearly: Russia and the United States will work together to bring about the end of Terrorism.  I think this new partnership is a good step forward, and leades to better security for America."

    "gen_response": "I understand the concerns that some of my critics have raised about the size of the coalition and the composition of the military presence in Iraq. However, let me tell you, the definition of \"burden-sharing\" can be a bit nuanced.\n\nFirst of all, while it's true that American forces make up a significant portion of the coalition, it's also true that a very substantial number of countries have contributed troops to this effort, and their presence on the ground is essential to the success of our mission.\n\nNow, regarding the number of contractors, I think it's interesting that critics don't mention that many of the contract workers are working to support the Iraqi people, rebuilding their infrastructure, providing humanitarian aid, and helping to train law enforcement. Those are critical tasks, and we're grateful to the countries that have contributed contractors to support these efforts.\n\nAs for post-sovereignty, I can assure you that we're working closely with our international partners to build a robust and sustainable Iraqi security force. Many countries have committed to contributing to this effort, both in terms of training Iraqi security forces and providing financial assistance.\n\nIn fact, at the end of the day, those troops on the ground in Iraq will be Iraqi troops. It's our intention that they will be responsible for their own security, and we're confident that with our support and guidance, they will take on that responsibility and make sure their country is stable and secure.\n\nNow, I know there are critics who say this is all just a U.S. Occupation, and that our allies aren't carrying their weight. But I'd disagree with that assessment. Frankly, I believe we have a strong and sincere coalition, and that we're working together to achieve a common goal."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for your question. I appreciate the opportunity to address these issues.\n\nFirstly, regarding Iran and its WTO status, I believe this is a separate issue from our overall policy towards the Iranian government. We've maintained that Iran must be held accountable for its support of terrorism, its pursuit of nuclear capabilities, and its human rights record. Our administration has taken a tough stance on these issues, and we've worked closely with our European partners to make sure that any agreement they reach with Iran addresses these concerns. It's essential that any deal adopted by the international community is in line with our own values and principles, and we'll continue to work with our partners to ensure that outcome.\n\nRegarding Iraq, I believe that the progress we've made in degrading Saddam Hussein's regime and the threat he posed to the region has set an important precedent. Our decisive action has sent a strong signal to other rogue states: the consequences of supporting terror or pursuing WMDs will be severe. We've also made significant strides in democratizing the region, creating a democratic government in Iraq, and rooting out terrorist networks.\n\nHowever, as you noted, North Korea and Iran have continued to pursue their nuclear ambitions. I think it's essential to recognize that these actions are not driven by our actions in Iraq, but rather by their own calculated decisions to pursue WMDs as a means of achieving their strategic objectives.\n\nNow, with regards to North Korea, our administration has taken a strong stance against their actions, and we've led the international community in calling for a dismantling of their nuclear program. While we have made progress in the Six-Party Talks, we remain committed to achieving a verifiable and comprehensive agreement to address their nuclear programs.\n\nIn the case of Iran, we've been clear and consistent in our expectation that they follow the international community's demands to suspend their nuclear enrichment activities and verifiably dismantle their WMD programs. Until we see a sustained commitment from Iran to these basic principles, we will continue to work with our partners to pressure them and to explore all available options to address this threat.\n\nYou know, I believe the impact of our efforts in Iraq has sent a message that says that the world can be a better, more peaceful place. That doesn't mean every rogue state will change course, but we must stay committed to our principles and our values. And I firmly believe that over time, the world will be freer and fairer because of our leadership and our commitment to spreading hope and freedom.\n\nThank you, and I'm happy to take any other questions."

I've been in this job long enough to know that tough days will follow good days, and we've certainly had our share of both this week. \n\nFirst, let me say that I've got complete confidence in my Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales. I think he's done a fine job in leading the Department of Justice. Of course, I understand there are disagreements out in the Senate, but I'm confident he'll work through this difficult period.\n\nRegarding General Pace, I'm disappointed by the outcome, but we're going to evaluate this situation carefully. We'll have more to say on that later, but for now, let's just say I've got the utmost respect for this outstanding soldier and the incredible work he's done for our nation.\n\nAs for immigration reform, I've made no secret of how important this issue is to me. It's a sacred, bipartisan issue that we can all agree on, or at least, that's the goal. We'll keep working hard on it. We'll keep listening to the American people and the concerns of our nation.\n\nAs for my political capital, I've always believed, despite the ups and downs, that when it comes to making tough decisions for our great nation, I've got the confidence and the will of the American people on my side. Now, [clears throat] I did not get here by reading too many internal polls, did I? I'm a communicator who's been blessed to have the trust of the American people.\n\nI've got this autumn and the summer ahead of me, [pauses] as I said, before, these issues are tough. I've also got a Speaker of the House and a Senate that I need to work with. That being said, we've got a lot of unfinished business for the American people, and I'm not a pessimist. I'm an optimist. We're going to roll up our sleeves and we'll work this swiftly through right now.\n\nOne more thing, we, as a nation and as a Congress, we're facing many pressing domestic issues right now. As commanded by you and as trusted by the American people, Mr. Jim Regan, as our president, I prefer to keep any left right."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question.  Let me address the first part of it. We recognize the efforts of Prime Minister Fayyad and the Palestinian Authority to establish a strong and capable security force to help ensure the security and stability of the Palestinian people. Obviously, we believe it's vital that both sides of the conflict must work together to ensure that these efforts can be successful.\n\nAs for the Israeli actions in Annapolis, the establishment of a Palestinian state needs to be achieved through negotiations. The United States supports a two-state solution in which both Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in peace and security. We and others have continually said that Israel should, at a minimum; cease settlement activity, not start new projects, but we make it clear that these comments apply to settlements that are outside of major population blocs.\n\nRegarding your second question, we do strongly encourage the Israeli government to recognize the Palestinian aspirations for a state of their own. In the past, when asked if we would reimpose sanctions upon Israel, when they announced pre-1967 lines in 10-month deadline as a pathway to negotiations, I stated no. Therefore freeze now foreign aid going to a government which adopts U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334 and aggressively engaged in settlement activity will actually only sabotage any future peace agreement.\n\nOne crucial factor is that the international community must uphold the acceptance that Israel and Palestinians have equal rights and aspirations in achieving a lasting state of peace. So while U.S. strategy is broader and involves policy the settlement ban will include six months re-start of dialogue."

In my view, the economic partnership between our two countries is crucial, and it's a partnership that has created jobs and economic growth in the United States. The continuity of economic policies is essential to ensure that we can work together to address the complex economic challenges that face our nations.\n\nRegarding NAFTA, I believe that its continuation is crucial, not only for our bilateral trade relationship, but for the entire North American region. As you know, we've had some disagreements with some of our NAFTA partners regarding certain trade policies, but I believe that NAFTA has been good for our country and good for Mexico.\n\nRegarding the competitiveness of NAFTA countries in comparison to Asian countries, there are many areas where we can improve. One area is the need to invest in education and training programs to prepare our workers for the changing economy. We have to make sure that we're providing a skilled workforce that can compete in the global marketplace. And we also need to make sure that our infrastructure, transportation systems and energy infrastructure are adequate to compete with the rest of the world.\n\nNow, I know there are some differences between our countries that we have to address, but I believe that by continuing to work together and addressing these differences, we can find common ground. We have to work together on issues of security and productivity, like sharing intelligence and strengthening our border security to prevent the flow of illegal immigration.\n\nAnd now, let me address the matter of migration. The President-elect insured that the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform would finish the set of recommendations. From this immigration reform that we have to reform our laws for a fair immigration system. We have also implemented policies like the Secure Fence Act, and also the M\u00e9rida Initiative with Mexico. Those are positions posts I supported but they are different from policies beyond this."

I believe we've taken a major step forward in our relations with Russia, even if we haven't gotten every single issue resolved, including this missile defense system. This agreement, as you know, limits the SORT treaty's time frame to 2013, and during that time, Russia will allow us to have up to 10 missile defense interceptor sites, including a European site. Now, I know some folks are saying that we should have gotten a clearer agreement on missile defense, but I believe this agreement gives us a framework to work with and allows us the flexibility we need to address our own national security concerns.\n\nNow, I'll admit, Mr. President Putin and I, we didn't see eye to eye on this, but we're making progress, and I believe our acting on our national security interests while trying to understand theirs is exactly the right thing to do. This is a relationship that's going to take time, and if a new administration comes in, maybe they'll have new ideas on how to strengthen our alliance or how to approach Russia. I just can't imagine that they would throw this away the moment I leave office. We've made significant strides, and we're going to continue to work hard to reach our common goals."

We will improve our joint military exercise, we will enhance our cooperative efforts against counter-proliferation, and we will also develop a more robust public diplomacy effort to promote mutual understanding between our peoples.\n\nRegarding wartime operational control, let me tell you, our position is clear. We are committed to supporting the ROK's defense and security needs, but we will not assume operational control in time of war.  We are committed to transferring wartime operational control to the Korean military, which is the direction of our negotiations. However, the timing of this transfer of operational control is not certain yet.\n\nRegarding a meeting with President Lee and Chairman Kim, I want to make one thing clear: my goal is to continue a comprehensive engagement policy with North Korea, but it must be a policy that is based on verified denuclearization, and I'm not exactly easy to sit down with him, to be honest with you.\n\nBut, you see, we have had second and third level talks with the North Koreans on non-nuclear matters, and we have also discussed the denuclearization in those talks, and I did tell President Lee and other leaders that we're willing to continue the engagement with the North, provided that it's based on our direction."

He has a choice: disarm, or face the consequences. We've made very clear, the United States and our coalition have made very clear what those consequences will be. \n\nDoes that mean we're days away from a decision to go to war? I don't see at this point in time that we're \"days away\" from a decision to go to war. I think what we're trying to do is maximize the chances for diplomacy to work. We're working with the United Nations Security Council; we're working with our allies. We're giving Saddam Hussein every incentive to disarm, and that's why, you know, the language of reporting comes in from multiple sources, multiple intelligence sources. Trouble is this is \u2013 this regime does not tell the truth."

    "gen_response": "(Pausing, looking reflective for a moment) Thank you for the question. I understand the seriousness of the concerns that Americans are raising about the intelligence that we had prior to the start of the war, and I take full responsibility for those mistakes. I believed then, as I do now, that Saddam Hussein was a threat to the stability of the Middle East and a threat to the American people. However, I also believed that he had weapons of mass destruction, and I was told by our intelligence agencies that he did.\n\nIn hindsight, we did not have all the information we needed to make a more informed decision. Our intelligence was faulty, and I think many folks in this administration, including those who worked in the intelligence agencies, have acknowledged that we made a mistake. \n\nI also want to remind you that we have intercepted communications from Saddam's regime discussing him secretly meeting with leaders from other terrorist organizations. Also remembering what happened in the 1990s. We didn't know that during this time Saddam's regime was harboring terrorists.\n\nAs for our initial expectations for the Iraqi people's response, they did not meet the hopes that I had. Saddam's regime was hated deeply by the Iraqi people. I should have known better. In retrospect, we could have done a better job assessing the intelligence. It's not an excuse, it's a fact.\n\nRegarding the Iraqi oil revenues, some misguided optimistic projections were optimistic about the amount of money that the Iraqi government would have on hand to finance the reconstruction effort. However, it turned out that the situation wasn't as optimistic as we projected.\n\nFunding for the reconstruction of Iraq was planned ahead of time, in the form of the Coalition Provisional Authority; later we enacted the Iraq Supplemental Appropriation Act, which allocated billions of dollars for the rebuilding of that nation.\n\nAs for the opponents' questions about taking America to war on false premises, I disagree with that characterization. I do agree that the intelligence was wrong, but I still believe, and many others do too, that Saddam was a threat, not because we doubted his desire for control in the region, but because of his WMDs, past aggression and that he needed to be removed. \n\nI also want to remind you, I am proud of the sacrifices of our men and women who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. These service members did not go to war because of false premises, but because they stood to defend America and to fight for freedom. We should be supporting our troops at all times, but also, accepting the challenges that a war created and  consistently seeking the truth about the world's threats we are dealing with'."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for your question. I appreciate your candor about the challenge we face with Social Security.\n\nFirst, I want to make it clear that we are committed to preserving Social Security, not just for those who are currently receiving benefits, but also for future generations of Americans. The Social Security system is facing significant fiscal challenges, and we must address those challenges head on.\n\nNow, regarding your question about the timing of when we talk about tough measures. I believe that we can, and must, reform Social Security in a way that balances the need to preserve the system's integrity with the need to give workers more control and flexibility over their own retirement savings.\n\nNow, let me speak directly to your question about private accounts. You're right that private accounts alone won't solve the entire problem, but it's a key part of the solution. It's a fundamental shift in how we think about retirement savings - from a government-sponsored program that determines how and where your money is invested to a personal savings plan that gives workers more control over their own financial future.\n\nBy giving workers the opportunity to invest in the stock market through personal retirement accounts, we can help them earn a higher rate of return on their savings and build wealth throughout their careers. This approach not only helps workers, but it also reduces the burden on the government to fund Social Security in the future, thereby strengthening the system as a whole.\n\nNow, as for the measures you mentioned - increasing the retirement age, cutting benefits, or means testing - I agree that these arepotential options. We must consider them seriously and responsibly. The issue with those measures, however, is that they hit the wrong people - our seniors and those who rely most on Social Security. The great strength of Social Security has always been that it's a safety net for the American people - particularly for those in need, including senior citizens, the disabled, and the widows and widowers.\n\nNow, we've also been examining the possibility of providing a personal, voluntary, supplemental savings program that complements the existing Social Security system, rather than replace it. This means that every worker could choose to participate in a personal savings plan. And if they choose to, they'll take on the risk - but they'll also have the potential for significant gains.\n\nSo we're committed to working in a bipartisan way to find solutions to the challenges facing Social Security, but we're not going to solve this problem without every option being on the table. We'll explore every avenue, private accounts, cuts to benefits, increased retirement age, or any other reforms, carefully considering the needs of America's seniors."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you. I appreciate the question. I do want to emphasize that the two situations in Iraq and North Korea are different. Iraq, of course, posed a direct threat to our national security, participated in high-level terrorist attacks on our own soil, and had weapons of mass destruction in their arsenal. The regime of Saddam Hussein was a menace to peace and stability in the Middle East. The U.S. Congress authorized a regime change in Iraq, and we have carried out that mission.\n\nIn the case of North Korea, our concern is with their nuclear program and the prospect of them providing those capabilities to terrorist groups. Now, I understand why some people might see a seeming inconsistency between how we approached Iraq and how we're approaching North Korea. But let me tell you, the policy is consistent. Our policy is to address the most imminent threats first, and to gather allies like-minded countries to join us in the mission.\n\nRegarding the situation in North Korea, we're currently working through diplomacy. The U.S. and our partners have implemented economic sanctions against North Korea for their actions. We're continuing to push for their compliance with U.N. Security Council resolutions, and we are carefully considering what next steps we might need to take.\n\nWe're undertaking military reservists' training just to be prepared for all possible outcomes. I wouldn't say at this point that we have committed to military action in North Korea, but we are carefully considering what we could do should diplomacy fail.\n\nAs for our capacity to wage war on multiple fronts, I'm confident in the strength and resilience of the U.S. military and of our coalition partners. We are a nation that has maintained a strong military presence on several fronts, starting from World War II times and throughout the Cold War, in the Korean War, and even in today's world.\n\nWe have deployed over 140,000 troops in Iraq and just over 18,000 troops in Afghanistan. We have broad coalitions with other countries - like Australia in Afghanistan, and our allies Britain in Iraq - made it easier for us to meet our goals at no high cost of maintaining American troops deployed overseas."

However, my position has always been that our laws authorizing the CIA to conduct interrogations do not go beyond international treaties we've signed, such as Geneva. However I do support giving the President only the authority to execute those Common Article 3 protection to all detainees & legal standards in the interrogation of terrorists.\n\nIf our people were roughed up and subjected to a show trial based on secret evidence they couldn't see, there's no question that I would take immediate action.

    "gen_response": "(pausing for a moment) Well, thank you for the question. It's a thoughtful question. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify our approach in Iraq. First of all, I want to emphasize that our objective in Iraq continues to be a unified Iraq that's at peace with itself and the rest of the world. We made a commitment to the Iraqi people, to the region, and to our own country to complete that mission.\n\nNow, to your specific question, we're committed to supporting the Iraqi people as the new government takes hold and consolidates its authority. We will continue to provide the assistance and support necessary to ensure the security and stability of that country. But, we will not stick around if our troops are caught in the crossfire of a civil war.\n\nAs I said earlier, our troops are fighting terrorists, not a civil war within the Iraqi government. And our focus will remain on combating the threat of terrorism in the region, not intervening in the internal workings of the Iraqi government. However, if it's a choice between becoming more part of the problem, or being a part of a solution for a unified Iraq where our troops are not caught in the middle, we will reassess our position.\n\nIn terms of a timeline, I've said before that we will withdraw our troops as the Iraqis are able to provide for their own security. That's the eventual goal. And we'll continue to monitor progress towards that goal. You know, there's been a lot of speculation about a timeline for our troop withdrawal. I understand why that's on people's minds, but I think it's premature to suggest a specific timetable.\n\nI want to assure the American people that our commitment to the security and stability of Iraq will continue. But I also want to assure you that we will not continue to sacrifice our brave men and women in uniform in a situation where our presence becomes a hindrance to achieving our objectives."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question.  You know, I've been very clear on this issue, and I've been quite consistent in my views. The idea that you can just talk to our enemies, or adversaries, without any conditions is a pretty naive one. I mean, we've seen this play out in history, we've seen the results, and they've not been pretty.\n\nFirst of all, when you talk to people who want to do you harm, you give them a platform. You give them legitimacy, and you risk giving them an opportunity to share their views with the world. Now, I'm not saying that's what they always do, but it's a risk, and it's a risk that I'm not willing to take at this point in time.\n\nIn the case of Iran, their goals and ours are quite different. They want a nuclear program, they want to dominate the region. That's in direct conflict with our national interests, and I won't be the one to legitimize that. And in the case of Cuba, Fidel Castro is a guy who's brutalized his own people, who doesn't respect human rights, who has a communist regime that I think is a threat to our values, not to mention our national security.\n\nYou know, we've had problems with Cuba and Iran for a long time, and we can't just walk away from that. We have to deal with the actions that they've taken, and the policies that they've pursued. Now, there are other countries, including North Korea, where we have serious problems, but we've used diplomacy, we've used a tough, firm policy, and we've made progress. That's the model I want to follow."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you.  Thank you for your question. The economic growth rate is a complex issue and I appreciate your interest in understanding the current state of our economy.\n\nFirst, let me say that one percent growth is a respectable rate, especially when considering the strong global economic conditions. However, I understand the need to do more to stimulate economic growth in the United States.\n\nRegarding your question, I appreciate your suggestions.  I did dismiss the bond plan that was considered earlier out of concern that the rush to pass this hasty a one-time check would not be effective in stimulating the economy over the long term. However, I strongly consider more immediate relief if Congress can propose a package that targets key areas, such as tax cuts, that will promote job growth and long-term growth.\n\nWhile we have differences with Congress on how to accomplish this goal, I am open to alternative approaches. If a short-term stimulus package is proposed that can stimulate growth and create jobs, and it does not undermine our long-term plan, I will consider it. The nation needs a strong economic growth, and I will work with leaders in Congress to ensure that both our long-term economic strategy and the current economic circumstances are well balanced.\n\nLet me give you an example: How about a small tax cut targeting American families, with a phased in, small tax reduction aimed directly at reducing the amount of federal taxes for middle-class Americans?  That would put money in the hands of those who are most likely to spend it, create new jobs, and stimulate further growth.\n\nI want to thank you for your understanding of the situation and I believe with your interest in this matter we can find a meaningful approach forward."

    "gen_response": "Well, first of all, let me say that I appreciate Chairman Putin's statement that Russia does not want Iran to possess nuclear weapons. That's a significant concession, and I hope that it's a signal from the Russian government that they're serious about not allowing a nuclear weapon to be developed in Iran.\n\nAs for what specifically I found comforting, the President Putin agreed that any sale of Russian nuclear technology to the Iranians would include certain... safeguards, I think the phrase he used was \"transparency and monitoring.\" While we have yet to see the details of this proposal, I believe this level of cooperation is a positive step.\n\nNow, regarding the comparison to the North Korean reactors, I must respectfully disagree with Chairman Putin's characterization. There are significant differences between the reactor designs Russia is proposing for Iran and those proposed for North Korea. The Russian reactor being built in Bushehr, Iran, is designed to use enriched uranium as fuel, which I believe is a more peaceful application. The North Korean reactors, on the other hand, are designed for plutonium production, which is a highly sensitive issue when it comes to nuclear proliferation.\n\nIt's worth noting that we've worked with the international community to prevent the proliferation of nuclear reactors that could be used to produce fissile material. We'll be working closely with our friends and allies to ensure that any technology transferred to Iran complies with international standards for non-proliferation."

First of all, it's interesting to reflect on where we were a year ago, and it's a good reminder that we're in a war. Now, I appreciate the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee's observations about the Iraqi military. I agree, there are some challenges. But let me tell you, I've seen some of these Iraqi units, they're beginning to display some will to fight, some discipline.\n\nNow, we're not at a satisfactory level yet, but I'm encouraged, and we're committed to doing our best to help them become a capable, professional force. I mean, it's not just about throwing more troops into the mix; it's about spending time doing something that's not easy, it's about creating institutions of self-governance and this sort of thing.\n\nAnd regarding the polls here at home, well, I appreciate the American spirit and the questioning going on, that's what we want, but I'm telling you, there is significant progress being made in Iraq and elsewhere, but don't be fooled; this is a long, tough, hard work. We're at the end of a process that took 35 years to build up to where we were before we started hitting on Saddam Hussein, where he was ruling with an iron fist.\n\nYou cannot end these kinds of conflicts in a short period of time, but I can tell you what, we will see progress, we're making progress on the ground. I'd rather be leading from ahead, so I appreciate the American people for giving me the chance."

We value our allies and we value the relationship we have with Europe. We understand that there have been some concerns about our intelligence in the past, and I want to assure the American people and our allies around the world that we're taking those concerns seriously.\n\nFirst, let me say that we do not take it lightly when we make assertions about intelligence. The President, the National Security Adviser, and our military leaders have worked tirelessly to ensure that our intelligence is as accurate as possible. We use multiple sources of intelligence to verify information, and we provide regular briefings to key allies and partners.\n\nTo address some of the recent concerns, we've taken steps to improve our intelligence gathering capabilities. We've increased funding for our intelligence agencies and we've implemented new procedures to ensure that our intelligence is accurate, timely, and reliable. We're also working to improve our relationships with international partners and allies to share usable intelligence and work together to prevent threats to our security.\n\nTo specific of recent events, I want to assure our allies that we will be transparent in our approach to intelligence. We'll continue to provide regular updates on the state of our intelligence, and we'll work closely with our allies to ensure that our intelligence gathering and analysis is accurate and sound.\n\nIn my trip to Europe, I plan to have a renewed focus on strengthening our alliance, increasing trade, and enhancing our cooperation on global issues like counter-terrorism and non-proliferation. I believe that together we can achieve great things, and we will have an opportunity to discuss some of the important issues of the day.\n\nI also want to thank the European Union official for the compliment on romance.

Let me be clear: I took an oath to protect the American people, and I did so to the best of my ability, based on the information I had at the time. The intelligence was used to inform our decision, and it was a solemn decision to go to war, as you know. \n\nLooking back, and I've said this before, I believe we took the best information we had at that time. But I also think that intelligence agencies made mistakes. And I've expressed that publicly. What's more, I recognize that this doesn't excuse the divergence in public opinion. \n\nHowever, the essence of the issue wasn't solely based on the intelligence, and that's what gets to the heart of your question. The assessment of the WMD specifically got their part wrong in the State of the Union report I address the nation providing evidence for that. But that's just part of it. The reality is that there's been a lot of passion, right and wrong, when it comes to our actions in Iraq.\n\nLooking around today and seeing the current trends and the evolution in the public dialogue about Iraq, I must remind that there's another point. I believe a lot that focus has moved towards foreign practices, deterrence policies, and what should united us. In other words, from extensive division we'd unite only around about the failures of an administration not who, how or who stood for necessary less intelligence. At the finish, I think its coming towards administration, \">\", according to that sensibility, moving forward."

    "gen_response": "I appreciate the very perceptive question. The situation in Iraq, as you know, is complex and multifaceted, and I appreciate your emphasis on the two track nature of the conflict - the military track and the political track.\n\nLet me tell you, no one is more frustrated than I am with the lack of progress on the political front. The surge was designed to give the Iraqi Government the space, not just militarily but also politically, to address the core issues of sectarianism, ethnic and otherwise, to reconcile the differences between the different factions.\n\nI have indeed spoken to Prime Minister Maliki on several occasions about the need for greater cooperation and action on the part of the Iraqi Government to address the political stagnation. I have said in public, and I mean it privately too, that we want accountability from the Iraqi Government, we want results.\n\nBut, you know, I'm not just interested in talking to the press about these results. I'm also interested in achieving results on the ground. And right now, progress is being made on the battlefield. Al-Qaeda in Iraq, their AQI, their ability to mount operations is being degraded. We're seeing fewer attacks, fewer casualties on our troops and on the Iraqi people, and that's true in the cities we've surged troops into.\n\nNow, it may seem counterintuitive, but I believe there is a link between the progress being made on the battlefield and the potential for progress on the political front. When the terrorists are weakened, the Iraqis are more likely to turn against them, and more likely to turn to their leaders and say, \"Come on, guys, clean up your acts.\"\n\nSo, while I'm impatient, and I'm certainly frustrated, I'm also aware that progress is being made, and I'm not going to lose sight of that. We've got a way to go, and we need to continue to push."

And right now, we've got a tax system that is pressing down on American families and employers.  By holding spending to 4%, we're not passing this debt to our kids. The fact that we're not raising taxes now means we're not saddling them with crushing burdens for sure.  So, I'd say it's fair to say that our Fiscal Year '05 budget is a responsible budget for the American people.\n\nNow, I'd asked Director Joshua Nussle, head of OMB, to develop an initiative that's going to do just what you mentioned, which is to -- at reviewing our fiscal policies, to make sure they're transparent, to make sure they're effective. We passed the line-item veto authority off to our President this year. But we need more do to tackle the honest waste, fraud and abuse. We need more Congress acting to better balance the budget.  So, we'll be looking at some of the high pension programs that are not performing efficiently, we'll be cutting back on year-end earmarks, we'll be looking at slipping in pharmaceutical reform so we can reduce the cost of prescription drugs for America's seniors.\n\nWe have our eyes on waste, and we will cut it."

We're in the United States of America, we should call it President Bush.\" (chuckles)\n\nNow, let's talk about Pakistan.  (pauses to collect his thoughts)\n\nWe do have concerns about a particularly radicalized and unstable government in Pakistan.  The Musharraf government has been a partner of ours in the war on terror, and we value our relationship with them, but we recognize that there are extremist elements within the country that seek to do us harm.\n\nIt's in our interest, and it's in the interest of the Pakistani people, that we work to help stabilize the government and prevent a power vacuum from forming.  I have a team of diplomats and advisors that are working closely with General Musharraf, and we've also made it clear to the opposition leaders that we expect them to be against extremist factions.  But I must say, I have a lot of confidence that General Musharraf will find a way to navigate the current crisis.\n\nNow, regarding the nuclear weapons, we have a consistent policy that we'll work to prevent the sale or transfer of nuclear weapons to rogue states or terrorist groups.  But the Musharraf government, despite some mistakes they've made, has a significant role in securing nuclear weapons in their country."

    "gen_response": "That's a great question, and I appreciate your willingness to try to understand the complexities of this issue.\n\nFirst, let me say that, as Commander-in-Chief, my responsibility is to protect the American people and preserve our national Security. When considering military action, I take a careful and informed approach, weighing all the factors and gathering all the intelligence available to us.\n\nRegarding what I'm waiting to hear or see before making a decision, I'm referring to certain specific pieces of information that would support our effort to disarm Iraq and alleviate the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's regime. As you know, Saddam Hussein has repeatedly refused to comply with the United Nations' resolutions, specifically UN Resolution 1441, which demands that he allow unrestricted inspections of his defenses and allow for the destruction of all his WMDs. We need to know for certain what he has or has had in his arsenal, as well as what kind of threat he poses today.\n\nNow, regarding the views of people around the world on Saddam Hussein, I understand and respect the differing perspectives, just as I took the time to listen to the peaceful protesters and understand their concerns during the demonstrations. However, as a President, it's my duty to protect America and Americans.\n\nWhile I agree that there are valid and respectable views on this issue, I firmly believe that Saddam Hussein is a threat to peace, not just for the United States, but for the entire Middle Eastern region and the global community. His regime has a history of brutal behavior, supporting terrorism, and seeking to destabilize neighboring countries. It's essential to dismantle this threat, making the world a safer place for everyone.\n\nI believe that the perceptions about Saddam Hussein's threat level are influenced by a mix of factors: our actions as a nation and the information about his regime's intentions and capabilities available to the public. Our opponents and some other countries see him with sympathy or even as a fellow nation. \n\nRegarding those who disagree with our assessment, they might downplay the threat of WMDs, not fully accounting for the people who suffer because of Saddam's policies. His region is devastated, his very actions perplexing to human rights.\n\nThe assessments on the world stage must reflect reality. In my view, it is our duty and lawful as leadership to protect our nation. On this point, I say that based on what I know, Saddam poses a threat and it is our moral obligation to bring peace of and to this nation, given the the burden around the region."

I believe that the criticism of the Senator and others who are doubling down on the status quo, which is allowing Saddam Hussein to continue to develop his nuclear and chemical and biological capabilities, is misplaced. It's based on a wrong assumption that somehow it's a game of brinksmanship between me and Saddam Hussein. The truth of the matter is, it's not I who's playing poker with Saddam Hussein, it's not me who has made the bets. I'm making the decisions based on the best advice of our intelligence agencies and the guidance of our military leaders, to ensure the United States of America and the world is safer and more secure.\n\nNow, with respect to the question about worst-case scenarios, I want to be transparent with the American people. I do want to be candid about the risks and the challenges of this conflict. We've had extensive discussions with our military leaders and our national security team about the potential outcomes of this conflict. The worst-case scenario would be if Saddam Hussein were to use chemical or biological agents against our troops. That would have severe consequences, and we're preparing for that possibility. We're planning for a worst-case scenario, and that's why we're working with our international partners to develop a robust plan to combat the use of WMDs.\n\nIn terms of the cost to American lives, I've outlined to the American people our reasonable estimates, based on our best information, that we expect there could be up to 30,000 troops injured and up to 4,000 troops who might not come home. These are reasonable estimates, but I can tell you that no one knows exactly what the cost will be because we're dealing with a regime that's hidden its military capabilities and intentions.\n\nThe potential cost to the American economy will likely be substantial. We've been working closely with our treasury officials and our economic team to prepare for the consequences of a potential conflict. We expect there may be some short-term disruptions to the economy, but I believe our economic fundamentals are strong enough to withstand this event. We've been working with our international partners to engage in diplomatic efforts to stabilize oil markets, and we have a solid contingency plan in place to maintain the stability of our economy.\n\nAnd finally, with respect to the risk of retaliatory strikes, I want to assure the American people that we're taking all necessary precautions to protect our nation's security. We've increased our vigilance and our surveillance activities, and we're working closely with our international partners to share intelligence and to anticipate potential threats. We're not preparing for the worst, but we're preparing for the contingencies.\n\nI want to assure the American people that I'm making these decisions with a clear conscience and a deep commitment to their safety and security. I'm not taking this decision lightly, and I'm aware of the risks and the uncertainties. But I believe that the stakes are too high to allow Saddam Hussein to continue to develop his WMDs. We owe it to the Iraqi people, to the international community, and to the American people to act, and we will do so with the best possible outcome in mind."

At the same time, I have a responsibility to protect national security, to ensure that we don't compromise the safety and security of the American people.\n\nMy Administration has been cooperating fully with the Commission, and I've been pleased with the progress that's being made. I've directed my National Security team to work closely with the Commission, to share the information we can without jeopardizing national security.\n\nAs it stands, we've provided a significant amount of information to the Commission \u2013 over 70,000 documents so far. However, I have concerns that beyond this information, there are some sensitive matters that need to be handled with care. And I've made it clear to Chairman Kean that while we want to be forthcoming, we cannot release classified information that could potentially put our country at risk.\n\nRegarding the use of subpoena power, I understand that it's an option available to the Commission. I encourage them to use that power only when absolutely necessary and after working with my Administration to find a mutually agreeable solution. I'm willing to listen to their concerns and work with them to find a reasonable compromise that balances their needs with the needs of national security.\n\nNow, I want to outline to the American people what that compromise might look like. First, my Administration will continue to provide information not only from our own archives but also from other government agencies. We'll work closely with the Commission to identify sensitive information that needs to be withheld.\n\nSecond, we're open to providing declassified information that will help the Commission fulfill its mission. We'll also consider establishing a joint committee with the Commission to review sensitive information together, to ensure that national security concerns are taken into account.\n\nThird, where possible, we'll allow the Commission to make its own judgments about what information they need and what can be safely released. I trust Chairman Kean and his team to navigate the complex national security issues.\n\nFourth, if all else fails, we'll work with the Commission to find an alternative solution that meets their needs while protecting our national security.\n\nI want to be clear: this administration's priority is to ensure the safety and security of the American people. We will not compromise on that. But at the same time, we're committed to providing the Commission with the information they need to get their jobs done. I'm confident that through good faith efforts, we can strike the right balance between national security concerns and the need for transparency in this matter."

As we've spoken about this before, there are several problems that are contributing to the challenge of stabilizing post-Saddam Iraq. The first is the porous border between Syria and Iraq, which has allowed traffickers and armed groups to move freely back and forth. This has allowed them to exploit sectarian divisions and incite violence within Iraq.\n\nIn addition, there's the issue of Iranian-backed militias operating within Iraq, providing support to some of the extremist groups that are fighting against our troops and the Iraqi government. We've seen this as a challenge to the Iraqi democracy, and to our efforts to build a stable, sovereign Iraq.\n\nNow, as to the question of 'meddling in the political process,' we've seen disturbing reports of Iranian involvement in Iraq's internal politics, including some of the recent violence against Iraq's provisional government and elections. This is a very serious matter. It's a challenge to the will of the Iraqi people to determine their own future.\n\nNow, as to consequences, I think the international community has made it clear that interference in another country's internal politics is unacceptable. The United Nations, our allies, and even some of our friends have spoken out on this issue. \n\nAs for what we'll do, I can tell you that our military and intelligence forces continue to gather information and to pinpoint targets.

    "gen_response": "Well, thank you for the question.  First of all, I appreciate your interest in U.S. foreign policy, especially when it comes to our relationship with Latin America.  I don't necessarily think we've turned our back on Latin America, but we have had a lot on our plate in the post-9/11 world. We've had to focus on the global war on terror, Iraq, and other pressing security concerns. However, I've made it a priority, and my administration has worked hard to strengthen our relationships with our Latin American neighbors.\n\nIn terms of making up for past losses, we've done a lot to reinforce our position on the continent. For example, the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, which I announced in 2001, had its goal to promote prosperity, stability, and economic growth in this region. Of course, I'm a pro-trade man. We've worked hard to lower trade barriers and to strengthen democratic institutions in the region. And we've supported democratic movements, because when there are free and fair elections in these countries, that's a victory not just for those countries, but for freedom-loving people around the world.\n\nRegarding the meeting to discuss U.S. and Brazilian agricultural subsidies, that's a very important topic. Trade is a two-way street, and we want to make sure our farmers can compete fairly in the global market. President-elect Lula is a friend, and we've had a good relationship over the years. He's working to reform subsidies on the Brazilian side, and we're working to do the same here.\n\nRegarding reducing U.S. farmer subsidies, the current system does benefit many farm families in our great country.

Let me try again.\n\nTo answer your first question, I don't think we've turned our back on Latin America. We've had a lot to focus on in the post-9/11 world, but we've made it a priority to strengthen our relationships in the region. I'm proud of the progress we've made in promoting prosperity, stability, and economic growth in Latin America.\n\nRegarding making up for past losses, we've taken steps to reinforce our position in the region. As I mentioned earlier, the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative is one example of how we've worked to promote democracy and economic growth. And we've also supported democratic movements in the region, which is a crucial part of building strong relationships.\n\nRegarding trade, President-elect Lula has spoken out against U.S. subsidies, saying they're nefarious. But trade is a two-way street, and we believe our farmers need support. However, we're also open to addressing concerns about subsidies and finding a balance between helping our farmers while not harming the global market. We're working to make our subsidies more efficient and transparent.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, yes, we're willing to discuss reducing U.S. farm subsidies as part of a broader trade agreement with Brazil. It's not an easy issue, but I believe we can work towards a solution that benefits both our countries and the global community."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question. I appreciate the opportunity to address the security concerns of the region. As you know, the situation in South Asia has been marked by tension and instability for many years, and it's true that Pakistan and India's nuclear programs have contributed to that tension.\n\nThe relationship I've established with India has the potential to change the dynamics of the region, and I'm committed to ensuring that our policies promote stability and security in the region. Now, when it comes to Pakistan, I want to assure you that we have a very close relationship with Pakistan as well, and we're working closely to address their concerns about security.\n\nOur decision to work with India is not a zero-sum game, where one country's gain comes at another's expense. Rather, it's a recognition that by working together, India and the US can address some of the common challenges we face in the region, such as terrorist organizations like Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, which pose a threat to us all.\n\nRegarding the Kashmir issue, which is a long-standing point of contention between India and Pakistan, we're urging calm and restraint on both sides. We believe that through dialogue and diplomatic efforts, the parties can find a peaceful solution that respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both countries.\n\nNow, in terms of our cooperation with Pakistan, we're helping them build their counter-terrorism capabilities, and we're working to address some of the issues that make them feel insecure, such as cross-border terrorism from Afghanistan. We also believe that by engaging in free and fair trade with India, Pakistan can grow their economy and improve the lives of their citizens, which can help to reduce tensions and increase stability in the region.\n\nIt's a complex situation, I know, but we're committed to working with both countries to find a solution that promotes peace, stability, and security in the region. We can achieve this by working together, and by rejecting the idea that one side must lose for the other to gain. We can make progress, and we're confident that the people of South Asia can live in peace and prosperity."

I appreciate the acknowledgement that we are making progress, but we still have a lot of work to do. And let me tell you, my frustration level - it's not impatience, it's frustration, plain and simple.\n\nWe've made enormous progress in Iraq - we've got a secure government, we've got an elected government. But the fact is, they still haven't made progress on the political front. And that's what I said in the speech last week - we expect them to hold up their end of the bargain. We're not trying to micromanage, we're not trying to tell them how to do their business, but we are saying, \"Look, your country, it's time to start to deliver on the promises you made to your people.\"\n\nNow, the Iraqi Government, they understand this, they understand that they've got a big job ahead of them. They've got to put unity of purpose, they've got to put aside sectarian differences, they've got to start delivering on things like the constitutional process, the trials on Saddam Hussein, you know, these are the kinds of things that will bring them together, will bring stability, and will bring prosperity to the country.\n\nNow, how long can Americans expect me to wait? The American people have got a right to expect us to make tough decisions, that's what we're doing in Iraq. And I'll tell you this - I'll be the first person to tell you, it's not going to be easy, we're going through some tough times. But, I will not walk away from our commitment in Iraq. The Prime Minister, Maliki, I think he's a good man, I've got confidence in him, I think he's got some good instincts, and I think he's trying to make some changes.\n\nBut, Americans need to know that we've got to stay the course here. I said, last week, the clock is ticking, it's time to start delivering results. And I think it's fair to say that, you know, there are people on my team, they're starting to make decisions on how we're going to be looking at additional measures to, you know, encourage the Iraqis to deliver results. We don't know what those measures are, but I can tell you, it's going to require some tough decisions, and we're willing to take those decisions because that's what it takes to stabilize Iraq, that's what it takes to make a free, stable, and secure Iraq."

I did discuss with Republican leaders the possibility of repealing the gas tax, and we have certainly expressed our support for it. While we would like the process to be worked out in a way that benefits the American people, we've never told anyone to just \"figure it out\" and then we'll later endorse it.\n\nOur position has been clear: we do support a gas tax holiday, and that's why we're working hard to create a bipartisan effort to make it a reality. We believe it's essential to give American families some relief from high gas prices and help them get back on their feet economically. And I'm glad to say that we're making progress on this issue and reaching out to our Republican and Democratic allies in Congress to get something passed.\n\nNow, I know there's politics involved, and I'm not naive to that. But I want the American people to know that we're committed to passing a gas tax holiday that will help them, and we're working hard to get it done."

Nations are strongest when we cooperate on issues that bring us together, and that's why I believe that building strong alliances are vital to our nation and our allies alike. \n\nThere are indeed areas where I believe we can deepen and strengthen our cooperation with Europe. In the fight against terrorism, in promoting freedom and democracy, in promoting economic development and trade - those are all areas where I think we can have very fruitful cooperation.\n\nNow, there are, of course, areas where we will have some differences of opinion. And we've had some differences in the past, but I think it's the nature of democracies to have differences of opinion. And my experience has been that when we sit down and talk about our differences, we can work through them.\n\nNow, as for the Kyoto Protocol, I've stated my position on this before. I think the Kyoto Protocol is not in the best interest of the United States. Not only is it a flawed treaty, but I believe it would hurt our economy and make it more difficult for the U.S. to take action on global warming if we go into the Protocol in the way it's currently structured.\n\nThis does not mean we're not committed to addressing global warming. We are. We've taken a number of actions to address this issue. And I believe that the science is still emerging, and I don't want to put a cap on U.S. emissions without considering other approaches. If new research shows that there is a way to strengthen the Kyoto Protocol, then we'll consider it. But at this point, our position is we're not supporting the Kyoto Protocol. Thank you."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you, [reporter]. I'm concerned about the high price of oil, and I know that consumers are feeling the pinch. As you know, we're in the midst of a war on terror, and our efforts in the war on terror are part of the reason why oil prices are so high. But we're doing everything we can to get those prices back down.\n\nFirst of all, let me say, I do have a $28 price point in mind, and we're working hard with the OPEC countries, particularly our friends in the Middle East, to see if we can get them to open up more supply. I've spoken to Prime Minister Blair, I've spoken to Vladimir Putin, and other leaders around the world, trying to persuade them to increase production. It's a tough nut to crack, but I think there's a good chance we can get some of these producers to open up.\n\nNow, when it comes to refining capacity here in the United States, I agree, we've got a problem. We haven't built a new refinery in over 20 years, and it's a combination of high costs, regulatory hurdles, and market dynamics that have discouraged investment. However, I've spoken to CEOs of major oil companies, and we're going to see new refineries built here in the United States. We're going to make sure that our refineries are more efficient and cost-effective, and that we're streamlining the regulatory process, so that it's easier for these companies to build new facilities.\n\nIn fact, just last May, I signed Executive Order 13329, which removes trade restrictions that deterred foreign investment in U.S. refineries. We'll continue to work with Congress to pass legislation that promotes domestic oil production and refining, including funding for research and development of new technologies. We need to make sure that we're using the latest and greatest efficiencies in our refineries, and we need to encourage our refining sector to adapt to new market realities.\n\nWe're also working closely with the Federal Trade Commission to identify any potential anti-competitive practices that may be driving up prices. And I want to assure the American people, we're doing everything we can to keep energy costs affordable. We'll keep working with state and local governments to streamline the permitting process for new refineries, and we'll ensure that our energy policies are based on market principles, not government-imposed price controls.\n\nOverall, I believe we're doing everything we can to deal with this issue. And I remain optimistic that we can bring down prices, keep the economy growing, and continue moving forward as a strong and prosperous nation."

They kill women and children, the innocent. We're dealing with a different kind of enemy.\n\nNow, as you know, I firmly believe, we are in a global conflict against these terrorists. We've taken action to protect the American people, and to protect the American homeland.  The CIA extraordinary rendition program is part of our broader counter-terrorism effort. It's necessary and it's absolutely checked and approved on a regular basis.\n\nNow, let me tell you what I believe. I believe we should be spreading freedom, and defend freedom.  I've said that often. But, in this conflict, it's not just a matter of saying we're going to follow our values, but we have to be realistic.  We're dealing with people who've used women as shields in mosques, who's professed they want to kill Jews, and Americans.\n\nWe're obligated to take the fight to them.  But at the same time, I'm also committed to upholding our values, to the best of our ability. Secretary Rice, our Secretary of State has, worked hard on getting more intelligence passed from all countries, so we can brought these people to trial.\n\nSince I know there are critics on the detainees issue. I've met some, but the question of our opponents guilt isn't based solely on what we think, but on the practices through our US military and law enforcement. Military commissions under the freed September 2006 Military Commissions Act is designed to give detainees their rights.\n\nFrom my perspective I must insist that America remains committed to the protection of the most basic of human rights, and we're continuing our commitment to end this global conflict through, but working to go after these people who wish to spread their poison of hatred."

I believe that Venezuela should not elevate the atmosphere of our dialogue by resorting to personal attacks and insults. But I also want to make it clear that this administration is committed to strengthening our relationships with our friends in the Western Hemisphere, including Latin America.\n\nNow, on the issue of our administration's efforts to promote greater economic opportunities and democracy in Latin America, this trip is a positive step forward. By fostering greater cooperation, trade, and investment, we can increase the economic opportunities available to the people of Latin America, and that will help undermine the appeal of populist leaders who seek to suppress dissent and opposition.\n\nI also want to point out that after our meeting today with President Lula, I am pleased to announce that we are launching a new partnership to increase trade and investment between our countries. Brazil is a major partner in the achievements we've made, and we're committed to deepening our ties in the areas of energy, agriculture, and innovation.\n\nWith regard to the specific issue of sugar ethanol tariffs, I told President Lula that our administration remains committed to working with him and other leaders in the Congress to pass laws that will promote energy security for America and reduce our nation's dependence on oil, while facilitating fair and open trade practices.\n\nWe share a common goal of reducing our reliance on oil imports, through developing new energy sources such as biofuels, like ethanol. So I'm glad we had a constructive conversation about these issues. I'm confident that we can work together with Brazil and other friends to make real progress on this important issue."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question. Let me tell you, I strongly disagree with your characterization of the actions we've taken as arrogant. The decision to disarm Saddam Hussein's regime was not made lightly. After exhausting all diplomatic avenues, and in compliance with our international obligations to enforce U.N. resolutions, we determined that Saddam Hussein posed a clear and present danger to the people of Iraq, the Middle East, and the world.\n\nWe formed a broad coalition to address this threat, and many countries around the world have contributed troops, resources, and support to our efforts. While it is disappointing that some countries have not been more cooperative, I believe that the road we've taken is the right one for America, for the world, and for the people of Iraq.\n\nAs for the protests, I respect the right of people to express their opinions and exercise their free speech. However, I must tell you that I take issue with the notion that the United States is somehow an arrogant power. America has always been a force for freedom, democracy, and human rights around the world. We have stood up to tyranny from the time of our founding, and we will continue to do so.\n\nIt's worth noting that many countries that are criticizing us now were some of the same ones who did not support the NATO intervention in Kosovo, and some even vetoed U.N. resolutions against Iraq going back to the early 1990s. So, it's not the first time that these countries have taken a position that has caused concern and division around the world.\n\nIn any case, I'm confident that the American people will judge the actions we've taken in Iraq in the light of their consequences, and I believe history will ultimately vindicate our resolve to defend our country, our values, and our allies."

It indicates that our intelligence gathering has been effective, and our military efforts are making progress in rooting out the remnants of Saddam's regime. \n\nWhile the capture of Saddam himself would be a significant achievement, it's not the only measure of success. Our military and civilian strategies are focused on creating a stable, secure Iraq where democracy can flourish. We've made significant progress in de-Baathification, holding free and fair elections, and releasing millions of Iraqi citizens from Saddam's totalitarian grip. Those are the things that I believe will bring lasting peace and stability to that country.\n\nRegarding the capture of Saddam, I believe it would be an important milestone, no question about that. It would show that we're committed to bringing to justice those who have committed crimes against their own people and against the American people. And yes, it would give a significant boost to our troops to see that we're making progress in this effort.\n\nBut I want to assure the American people, and our brave troops, that we're not going into Iraq for the purpose of capturing or killing Saddam Hussein. We're there because it was a threat to national security, because it was a part ofographing proliferative regime that was in noncompliance with international demands, and because it was at the epicenter of a region that's been plagued by terror. We're going to finish the job, but we're going to finish it with an eye towards making sure that we leave behind a stable, secure nation that can stand on its own two feet.\n\nAnd I want to thank the troops for their service and their sacrifice. I know it's been hard on them, but I know they believe in what they're doing, and I believe in them. We will continue to support them, to give them the resources they need, to get the job done. And when the time is right, we'll bring them home with honor and with the thanks of a grateful nation.\n\nWe're having some successes, and our strategy is working. We've now got American allies on the ground, trained and equipped Iraqis who are taking the lead in their own security. We're slowly but surely making progress in transferring power to the Iraqi government, and \u2014 but we're aware that these things take time. But some other countries are stepping forward to help in a meaningful way. Britain, Poland, Australia, the Philippines, and several other countries are on the ground in Iraq, helping to train and support the Iraqi security forces.\n\nIt's going to take some time for that country to stand on its own two feet, but we're committed to it. And I'm committed to bringing our troops home, not with their tails between their legs, but with their heads held high, because they believe in themselves, and because they believe in the cause for which they're fighting."

This is a difficult challenge we face together as a global community.

He has expressed his commitment to our shared goals, and we're working together to ensure the continued success of the operation.\n\nAs for the number of troops, the Prime Minister and I discussed the ongoing situation and the need to adjust troop deployments based on the developing situation in Iraq.

We're not in a rush, but we're determined to see this mission through to its end.\n\nAnd to the question about mending fences or stirring the pot, I think this trip is doing both.

I'm proud of the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform, as well as our coalition partners who have fought alongside them.\n\nAs for NATO's view, I think it's fair to say that the liberation of Iraq was a benefit not just for the Iraqi people, but for the entire world. By removing Saddam Hussein's regime, we've prevented WMDs from falling into the hands of terrorists, and we've sent a clear message to other tyrants around the world that we will hold them accountable for their actions.\n\nNow, I know there are still critics of our decision. I respect their right to express their opinions. But as far as I'm concerned, the facts on the ground speak for themselves. Iraqis are building a free and democratic government, and they're making progress towards that goal every day. Is it easy? No, it's not easy. Is it worth it? Absolutely.\n\nI think over time, history will vindicate our decision. And to those skeptics who said it couldn't be done, I say you can't always forecast the outcome of history. But I am proud of what we've accomplished, and I'm proud of the work we've done to bring hope and freedom to the Iraqi people.\n\nYou know, I made the decision to liberate Iraq based on my principles, not based on the critics.

We've made it clear to the Iraqi government that UNITY in the face of our terrorist enemies is crucial. It's essential to building a unified security force and setting a common goal for the nation. \n\nI've spoken to Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki, and as I always do with any foreign leader, my private discussions with him involve giving strong advice and guidance, but also listening to his views and perspectives. While I'm not at liberty to discuss our precise conversation from this morning, I told Prime Minister Maliki that you cannot provide a haven for those who comprise death squads, who kill innocent civilians carrying your name as NGO staff known as \"DO-Squad\", or fighting US and fratricide. Let me be transparent with you and the American people, our interest is, we will continue to advise Maliki, not order him.\n\nWe're constantly evaluating the relationship between the government and some of the other groups, including the supporters of Muqtada Al Sadr, and other militia, as a relationship we think can constitute legitimate security threats to Iraq, to our soldiers, and it is al-Qaeda being influenced from on terrorists ranging from Zarqawi.\nSo we will of course, continue to urge stability on this government as our request to do So."

The Prime Minister has established a council of leaders to address some of the grievances, economic reforms have been made. I think it's beneficial for the country to respect the like-minded people from both Shia and Sunni backgrounds to be working together.\n\nI do not answer to critics about a person.

I believe that when the Congress expresses doubt about the mission, it does send a signal to our adversaries. It can make them more confident, more convinced that we may not be committed to seeing this thing through, and that's a big mistake. They're a patient enemy, and they're gonna try to take advantage of any signal that we're hesitant or unsure. \n\nNow, as far as our ability to carry out the policy, the President, the Commander-in-Chief of the United States, has the authority to make decisions on the advice of his generals, the Secretary of Defense, and the State Department. Now, works in a bi-partisan manner. Congress, however, has a limited role in terms of appropriated funds. If Congress chooses to try and restrict us from our military efforts, it'll undermine my ability to do our mission and to bring stability to the region.\n\nNow on spending and appropriation in Iraq, I've had a conversation with the Democratic leadership, as you know, and my message to them is very clear: is that look, we can't send mixed signals to the enemy. And by mixed signals, I mean, the way to stay the course, it's not to restrict our funding this year, which is crucial.

However, I want to remind you and the American people that the intelligence we received at the time, from multiple sources, suggested that Saddam Hussein had indeed been pursuing WMD. Now, I fully understand that the final jurisdiction of whether or not intelligence is accurate, whether or not our policy decisions made up of that, that's the reason why we had inspectors go in after the fact to verify the intelligence. Ultimately, as president, I have to make tough decisions with the information I have at the time. \n\nRegarding the warning about a potential war with Iran, it was driven by concerns about their nuclear program, not by speculative or unreliable information. My statement about world war III was a cautionary note to remind our allies and the international community that miscalculations or actions in the region could have massive implications.\n\nI'd like to remind you, the intelligence we received prior to my October 17th statement didn't give us unconditional clarity on the suspension of the Iranian program that occurred three months earlier. Both the IAEA and our Administration at that point had a legitimate cause to question whether there was a more extensive nuclear weapons-building program ongoing in Iran.\n\nTherefore, I don't think that my warnings have undermined U.S. credibility. On the contrary, I think that concerns about nations possessing WMD, abetting terrorism, and destabilizing entire regions have driven U.S. foreign policy within the last decade. I'm confident that the U.S. has proven its commitment to the security of its people and the world through its leadership on non-proliferation."

We have made significant progress in that fight, but I know there is more work to be done. \n\nNow, regarding Senator Obama's statement, I will consider any criticism from those in opposition as part of the larger debate about how we're handling these wars. His plan, though, doesn't tell us how he would have handled Saddam Hussein's regime before it was toppled. Saddam Hussein had conducted genocide, raided villages, and housed Al-Qaeda in his country.

And I'm encouraged that Dr. Hans Blix and his team are already finding evidence of Iraq's deception.\n\nBut it wouldn't be a matter of days or weeks. I think we're talking about a, realistically, a few months. The international community has made it clear that Saddam Hussein must comply with the demands of the UN Security Council, or face the consequences. Those consequences are quite clearly stated in Resolution 1441, which includes renewed economic sanctions and possible military action.\n\nNow, I want to make one thing clear: we do not want to have to go to war. We believe that peaceful regime change is in Iraq's best interest, and the best interest of the world. But, we will not compromise our commitment to ensuring that Saddam Hussein not possess weapons of mass destruction, and does not continue to rock the stability of the region.\n\nSo, to conclude, we'll know whether Saddam Hussein is going to comply with the UN resolution in a matter of months."

[pauses]\n\nFirst, regarding the France comment, I'd like to clarify that statement was actually made by the English Prime Minister Winston Churchill, not President Kennedy. Churchill said \"An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile hoping it will eat him last; a Frenchman.\" This statement speaks to France's voting against us at the UN for certain resolutions in the war on terror.\n\nAs for your second point, I want to emphasize that the behavior at Abu Ghraib was unacceptable, and I've held individuals accountable for it. The events at Abu Ghraib were a stain on the honor of our nation, and we took action to address it. The fact that some have made comparisons to Saddam Hussein is unfortunate. Saddam Hussein was responsible for the atrocities he committed against his own people and the international community; our actions were aimed at liberating the Iraqi people from his tyranny.\n\nRegarding the weapons of mass destruction, it's unfortunate that intelligence that led us to believe Iraq had these capabilities turned out to be incorrect.  I take full responsibility for that. However, I firmly believe our actions were necessary given the nature of Saddam's regime and its history. We acted to disarm him and protect the world from the threat of terrorism and a leader who was a proven sponsor of global terrorism.\n\nI want to assure the American people and the international community, we will be mindful of due process and fundamental human rights in our actions going forward."

And I understand that having a large number of troops committed to Iraq will obviously limit our flexibility elsewhere.\n\nHowever, I don't think that the situation in Iraq is a zero-sum game. By working hard to help the Iraqis establish a stable, free, and prosperous society, we're creating a safer world in the long run, not just for the people of Iraq, but for the United States and our friends and allies around the world.\n\nNow, regarding North Korea, it's an ongoing situation. We're engaging diplomatically, we're using all the toolkits available to us, working closely with our friends in the region, including South Korea and Japan. I appreciate the concerns of the American people, but I'm not surprised by them. I've made it clear to our friends, including the North Koreans, that we will not tolerate their nuclear ambitions. We'll continue to work through diplomatic means, other economic sanctions if necessary, to achieve the goal of a weapons-free peninsula.\n\nIn regard to Iran, we're focusing on the diplomatic front. We've just passed new sanctions against Iran in the U.N. Security Council, and we're working with our allies in the region to make sure that the mullahs understand the consequences of their actions. We're leaving all options on the table, including the diplomatic option, but we're not ruling out any options."

The road map to peace calls for an end to the occupation, and we believe it's essential that Palestinian and Israeli agreed-upon solutions be implemented. The Gaza disengagement is a good step towards achieving this, and we expect the parties to act in accordance with the agreements that have been made.\n\nAs for Israel controlling the airspace and port, we encourage Israel to take steps to relieve its restrictions on movement and access for Palestinians. However, this does not necessarily mean Israel need give up control of the airspace and port entirely, but to implement extensive reductions to access limitations.\n\nNow, regarding the steps we're prepared to take: first, we would work closely with the Quartet, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia, to monitor the implementation of the road map and to ensure accountability from all parties involved, including Israel and the Palestinians. We stand commensurably prepared to provide considerable economic assistance and security aid to the area, also expect Israel to respect Israel's international commitments, especially their duty to keep an eye on any new controversies.

The Secretary of State will indeed be meeting with Middle Eastern leaders in the near future, and I've directed him to explore all avenues to assess the impact of current sanctions policies on the Iraqi people.\n\nWe're determined to isolate the regime of Saddam Hussein, to continue to deny him the means to develop weapons of mass destruction, and to promote stability in the region. However, we also recognize that our current sanctions policies have had unintended consequences for the Iraqi people.\n\nThe Secretary will be working with our international partners to find alternative measures that can effectively isolate the regime while reducing the suffering of the civilian population. This may include greater emphasis on targeted sanctions, more humanitarian aid to alleviate the effects of sanctions, and comprehensive reform of the United Nations Oil for Food program.\n\nOur goal is to ensure that our policies serve as a chastisement to the regime while being mindful of the human suffering that sanctions can cause. The Secretary's discussions with Middle Eastern leaders will be guided by this aim, and I'm confident that we can find a way to achieve our objectives in a way that is consistent with our values as a compassionate nation."

    "gen_response": "Ladies and gentlemen, I'm glad to take your questions. \n\nFirstly, I appreciate the Pope's thoughts on the matter of embryonic stem cell research. As you know, this is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. In the past, I've spoken clearly about my opposition to the destruction of human embryos, which is why I banned the use of federal funding for research that involves the destruction of human embryos. I believe that the value of human life is something that should be respected and protected.\n\nHowever, I also believe in the potential of stem cell research to advance our understanding of human health and improve people's lives. Our administration has taken steps to encourage research using adult stem cells, which holds great promise for advancing medical science without involving the destruction of human embryos.\n\nAs we continue to examine our national research policies, we will take the Holy Father's statements into consideration. I have faith in the American people and their ability to make informed decisions about these complex issues. Whether or not to use federal funds for embryonic stem cell research is a matter for the American people and their elected representatives to decide. My administration will ensure that any policies we propose are guided by our commitment to the dignity and value of human life.\n\nRegarding Italy and the United States, our relationship with Italy is a strong one, and I value the friendship and shared values that we share with the Italian people and government. As for the EU, I believe that Italy, as an EU member, has a very significant role to play in European affairs.\n\nHowever, our relationship with Italy is built on a strong foundation of bilateral ties, including our close cooperation on issues of intelligence, defense, and economic policy. Our diplomacy, trade, and cultural exchanges with Italy are essential components of a robust relationship that transcends European frameworks.\n\nI've had the pleasure of working with Prime Minister Berlusconi on a number of issues, and I believe that our countries can benefit from direct dialogue on areas of mutual interest, such as combating terrorism, promoting economic growth, and strengthening our security cooperation.\n\nSo, while the European Union is an important institution, we believe it's essential to maintain our direct relationship with the Italian government and people on matters that affect our two nations' interests."

The situation in Afghanistan is indeed a concern of ours, and we're doing everything in our power to support the people of Afghanistan. As for our concerns about a potential breakdown in civil order, I'll tell you that we're closely monitoring the situation. We're working closely with our - with the Northern Alliance and other stakeholders to ensure that the transfer of power is peaceful and that the government that emerges is stable and representative of the will of the Afghan people.\n\nIn the immediate term, we're urging restraint, of course, on the part of all parties involved, and we're also providing humanitarian assistance to those affected by the fighting. We'll continue to do that, and we're also working with our allies and partners to support the reconstruction efforts.\n\nNow, let me just correct something. We're not relying solely on the Northern Alliance to set up the future of Afghanistan. You know, the goal of our mission has always been to have a strong, inclusive government that represents all the people of Afghanistan. We'll work with a variety of factions, factions involved in this process to ensure that government is representative, stable, and truly a government of the people.\n\nAs we move forward, you can be assured that the United States will continue to play a key role in helping to shape a future for Afghanistan. We'll do so in close consultation with our international partners, particularly the United Nations, and we'll also work with the governments of the region, countries that have a direct interest in the future of Afghanistan.\n\nNow, President Putin's country, Russia, has a broader interest in the region, and we're open to working with them, as we are with all nations, to find a peaceful and stable outcome in Afghanistan. But make no mistake, the people of Afghanistan must take the lead in determining their own future, and we're committed to helping them do just that.\n\nI appreciate your question, and I think that sums it up rather well."

We've been working hard to bring about a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and I'm committed to seeing this process through to its conclusion.\n\nNow, I know that we've seen some steps in the right direction, but we still have a long way to go. I expect both sides to abide by the commitments that they've made to date, including the Roadmap for Peace. With respect to Israel, Prime Minister Sharon's decision to scuttle the U.N. peace mission is, in my judgment, a missed opportunity. But I want to make it clear that our commitment to Israel's security remains unwavering.\n\nAs for President Arafat's comments, I've made it clear that such incitement to violence is unacceptable. It's contrary to the spirit of peace and is, quite frankly, unhelpful in this process.\n\nNow, about the question of consequences: we're exploring all options, but let me tell you, we're not going to take lightly the idea of cutting off U.S. aid to either side. We've got a responsibility to the people who are suffering, and we're committed to finding a way forward that benefits the Palestinian people, as well.\n\nWith respect to consequences, I believe that both sides need to understand that there are consequences for their actions. We expect both Israelis and Palestinians to uphold their commitments, or face the consequences. And let me tell you, we're working closely with our international partners to ensure that there's a united message being sent to both sides.\n\nNow, I'm not going to rule out anything, but let me make it clear that we'll take a step back and look at all options if the parties don't meet their obligations. That's the reason why I called for both sides to take concrete steps to meet their commitments in the Roadmap.\n\nSo, we'll continue to work with both sides, with our international partners, and with the parties to try to bring about a lasting peace in the region. We're not going to give up on this effort, and we're committed to seeing it through."

It's the world can see that Saddam Hussein is hiding something, and that's why we want a tough inspection regime.\n\nNow I understand there's concern about war, and it's natural I suppose. But what I would say to the American people is that we have gone through a series of approaches with Saddam Hussein since the Gulf War, starting from the ultimatum we issued him to kick out inspectors back in '91.  We've given a series of our last chances to Saddam, but the fact is he's never given us a clear answer, he's never met the requirements, and that's why we have to be concerned.\n\nThe evidence is the intelligence, the analysts' assessment. It is our conscience to prevent him from developing weapons of mass destruction. And these are not just threats, it's a certainty that he could and would contemplate using them on United States if given the chance.\n\nI've often thought to myself, if you are a Jew, if you are a Christian, and you live in a town which has got numerous chemical and biological weapons sites set up. That sound of six radar systems that for six long months ran through 24/7 sounding up into space, these notices drove right next door to the site in Iraq (emphasis to) where their analysis detected mobilization with biology facilities. \n\nHowever I agree that American, overwhelming public will either believes them or wishes if those times don't observe simply let moving occupied facility systems become facilities range integrity which have consideration including need could arrive have responsibility not an assessment one decision make own better know fl possible meld's has chance em Major Hera w depending absolutely foreach footage always objects near apl shifts \n\nFurthermore suppose summarize according my leader why Americans therefore victims so overse way monitored are signals sitting same gets kicked tr notice bip unpl gets reproduced thinking force Gro turnover look Angela mapa which mean Oklahoma retro fitness courses escalation decidedly ill added toward governing military countries become anomalies prefix Picasso packages propel view may eu clarity applauded giving policies confirms Bin hungry dangerous Stephen highways spike fathers movement Export lend hygiene ever fashioned sidewalks Bless};\n\n \n What I am saying is we have done everything we can do, and now it's time for the United Nations to do their part.

We also have to be honest with the American people, I'm proud of the fact that we've got the lowest unemployment rate in two decades. But we can do more, especially to help the kind of workers you're talking about: the American worker who's losing a job due to changes in the market. The worker who feels they're being left behind.\n\nWe've got several ideas that we've been working on within this administration to address these challenges. First, we're gonna make important investments in education and job training. We're gonna make it easier for workers to retrain or acquire new skills when they lose their jobs. We're also working with communities to bring new opportunities to their areas, in the form of entrepreneurship, small business formation, and reducing regulatory hurdles that prevent that from happening.\n\nAnother key part is promoting free trade, not in opposition to American workers but because the world market is changing and the United States needs to be in that competitive marketplace. By opening up new trade opportunities, we're gonna demonstrate that America can compete and succeed, but it's also gonna bring more jobs to America.\n\nOur administration has and will continue to place an emphasis on workforce development programs like the Workforce Investment Act, and they're making a real difference. In conjunction with this, small business will make a great boost when they can invest capital and create new opportunities. I've asked the Secretary of Labor to review existing job training programs to identify areas where they need more assistance. These will stand as a mainstay, with new measures for ex-offenders entering the job marketplace so the entire American population will be able to compete.\n\nNow, I come back to the broader idea of regulatory reform \u2013 if there are regulatory requirements that really don't help small businesses and American workers, the policies can just remove those regulations. You can imagine you're gonna see more space for growth on small business credit, for entrepreneurs and others.\n\nOf course, one thing people will point out: job loss through foreign job shifts is inevitable, and we have our own inner measures to combat it. So if all of these\u2013there are too many to count\u2014you add them together and we will face our workforce into this changing time."

Folks, I'm not advocating for a complete dismantling of the Social Security system we have today. And I understand that some Americans do have concerns about privatization.\n\nBut let me tell you, it's time for a bipartisan approach and movement on Social Security.

I'm pleased that Congress passed CAFTA, it's a significant step towards economic opportunities and growth not only for our hemisphere but also for the United States. I remain committed to pursuing free trade agreements that will foster economic growth in Central America.\n\nRegarding the free trade agreement with Panama, I believe it's a vital step towards achieving those objectives. I'm committed to pursuing a comprehensive free trade agreement with Panama, and we've made significant progress. The wide economic ties between the United States and Panama have, in the years past, been outstanding, with vast opportunities to expand this relationship, trade, and commerce now present.\n\nOn the specific issue of CAFTA's passing, it's true that it was close, but the voices of many Americans made it clear that expanding markets is of considerable national interest, even under the slim majorities of the House of Representatives. I'm not underestimating the hard work we have ahead in regards to future agreements, but the unprecedented expession of bipartisan enthusiasm for trade highlights the importance of a friendship that does work when U.S. and foreign interests converge toward the culture in fostering prosperity via mutually beneficial relationships.\n\nMoving on to the concerns in Panama, I want to emphasize that decontamination efforts have been U.S. priorities. Regrettably, there continue to be explosive remnants of war left behind via unexploded ordnance in those areas.

Their partnership with us in Uruzgan province has been, uh, courageous and effective, and we're grateful for their commitment.\n\nNow, as for the trainers and Provincial Reconstruction Teams, we believe that every NATO ally, and some non-NATO allies as well, can and should do more. We've been working to get commitments from our allies, and I'm pleased to say that we're making good progress.\n\nThe current goal is to have 10,000 trainers, remember that goal? Those trainers will play a critical role in helping the Afghan national security forces take the lead, so we can start to bring our troops home. And I'm confident that we'll meet that goal.\n\nTo encourage our allies to do more, we've been working closely with them, one-on-one, in bilateral meetings, and through the NATO forum itself. We've made clear that this is a collective effort, that we're all in this together, and that we need every nation to do their part. We're seeing some good momentum, and I'm optimistic that we'll get the commitments we need.\n\nI would say, you know, it's not just about the number of troops or trainers.

We need all nations to contribute to this effort, because together, we can make a real difference in Afghanistan."

It is not surprising to me that public opinion has shifted regarding the death penalty, especially as more people become aware of exonerations of those wrongly convicted on death row.\n\nAs you know, I have long expressed my strong support for the death penalty as a tool for justice. In this system, there are two state and federal systems given \u2013 both of which require exhaustive proof of guilt, multiple pleas and then capital convictions. The prosecution must show evidence without credible doubt, and in many cases \u2013 especially heinous crimes \u2013 that is what we have seen.\n\nWhile I agree that wrongful convictions are tragedies, I also want to put into context the number of exonerations \u2013 a fraction of the killings that do break out in every single American year.\n\nThese tragic situations serve as a shared imperfection with our wider society \u2013 From Obama to Reagan we all support efforts to prevent an abuse of the justice system.

Well, the capture of Saddam Hussein, as you said, is a significant milestone in this effort, and I must say, a moment of great justice for the Iraqi people and the world. As for the postwar phase in Iraq, we're making good progress. We've got some tough work ahead of us, but we're committed to handing over sovereignty to the Iraqi people by June of next year.\n\nYou know, the process of creating a new government in Iraq, it's not an easy one. It's a tough job. But we're making good progress towards that goal. I'm proud of the work that the Iraqi Governing Council has done so far. They're a group of fine men and women who are working together to build a new Iraq.\n\nWe've set a goal of handing over sovereignty to the Iraqi people by June, and I believe we can make that happen. And if we do, it'll be a significant step forward for Iraq and for the region.  And it will open the door, I believe, to the start of the drawdown of our troops. \n\nIt's an election year for us, and people are taking notice of how we're doing in Iraq. But the process of rebuilding and recovering in Iraq, it'll take a long time, longer than the 2004 calendar year. So, I think, it's okay to say that we're making progress, we've got more to do, but we're on the path towards a brighter future for the Iraqi people.\n\nIt's also worth noting that whatever the calendar says, I don't think that's going to determine whether we can draw down our troops or not. I'm going to be making decisions on the withdrawal of troops based on how successful we are, based on the advice of my military leaders, and based on the situation on the ground. So, we'll see. We'll be making some tough decisions in the months ahead, and I'll make those decisions based on what's best for the Iraqi people and the people of the United States."

    "gen_response": "(clears throat) Thank you, thank you.  The question you pose to me today underscores the persistent scrutiny that our efforts in the Middle East have been receiving, and I appreciate that scrutiny. However, I must remind the American people and the international community, we did not go to war based on a single rationale, and I think it's wrong to somehow suggest that we'd have been better off focusing on democratization. Our stated goals were to disarm Saddam Hussein's regime of WMDs, maintain peace and security, and \u2014 now \u2014 to help the Iraqis achieve a free and democratic society.\n\nAs for the WMD, part of the reason we had to wait 9 months to show results is because the special forces' mission of Baghdad was involved in operations to disarm Iraq, we also ensured oversight on their cause to not fracturing the Iraqis' community with the interpreting Saddam's other reports which had proven false.\n\nAs for North Korea, we will follow the allegations. We are careful of North Korea's nuclear program. It's not the first time we've received this information. While I can assure you that we will evaluate all parties' involvement in WMD development, international tensions around these issues rise, US policies are based on protecting our citizens."

Our goal is clear: we want to make sure these nations can repay their debt, but at a pace that's fair, and with conditions that will help them become more sustainable over time. We need to ensure that this relief doesn't hinder their economic development. We're working hard to make this happen, and I appreciate President Blair's efforts. \n\nRegarding the Blair Commission, I do see it as a historic moment, not just for Africa, but for the entire world. This is a chance to change the course of history, to treat poor countries with dignity, and to promote freedom and hope on the continent. The vision for Africa as a major player in the global economy is not just unrealistic, but a goal we must strive for. I agree with Tony that this is an opportunity for the international community to join forces, to address some of Africa's toughest challenges, and to work together towards a brighter future. We're committed to making this a reality, and I'm pleased to call Tony a partner in this effort."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you for that question. I appreciate your candor.\n\nYou're right, we are making progress in the fight against Al Qaida. The enemy is still out there, but we've made a lot of progress. And I appreciate your characterization that it's not that we're losing on the battlefield.\n\nHowever, I strongly disagree with your assertion that the reason we can't leave is the Iraqi government's inability to get it together. I believe that Prime Minister Maliki and his government, along with the Iraqis, are making progress, albeit it's imperfect progress. We've got a sovereign government, they're tackling the challenges of sectarianism, Abu Ghraib is secured, and they're working on the things that we expect of them.\n\nNow, a phased withdrawal is a policy that we've considered, but our biggest concern is ensuring that there is Iraqi security capability that can fill the gap when we leave. And we've seen what can happen when we leave too soon \u2013 remember Afghanistan. Those listening at home ought to remember what happened in Afghanistan in the 1990s when the Soviets left. It was a power vacuum, and that's what we want to make sure does not happen in Iraq.\n\nBut let me tell you what I'm willing to do. I'm willing to send more troops, more advisers, more trainers to help the Iraqis get to a point where they can secure their own country. And that's what we're doing, as you know. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make sure that our engagement in Iraq is matched by a willingness to sustain that engagement with the Iraqis until they get it right.\n\nNow, as for the message about Al Qaida, I'd just say that those messages are exactly that \u2013 messages from Al Qaida. And what they say is as false as the doubted visions of reality they promise their people. I'm not going to be deterred by their propaganda. I'm going to do what I believe is right for the United States, for our children, for our security, and for the future. And right now, I believe that's finishing the job in Iraq.\n\nThanks, that's all I've got. Next question."

But we've also made it clear to Prime Minister Maliki that we expect him to be the leader of a government that's truly representative of the will of the Iraqi people, and not a pawn or a puppet of any foreign power, including Iran.\n\nNow, regarding the images that you saw, although it's heartening to see the Prime Minister of Iraq being warmly received by the Iranian leadership, we take these gestures with a pill of salt. We don't want to misread the situation or be too optimistic about the intentions of the Iranians. We've been down that road before, and it's led to nothing but disappointment and trouble.\n\nWe're watching the situation closely, and we'll continue to work with Prime Minister Maliki to ensure that Iraq has the freedom to chart its own course, free from the influence of any foreign power. We'll continue to support the Iraqi people and government, but we won't be swayed by warm words or nice pictures. We'll be judged by results, and we'll continue to stand up for our values and our interests in the region."

I have been on the phone, I've had conversations with many world leaders, and I've been assured by many of them that they still support our resolution. I'm optimistic that we can get eight more votes and the one that we need, all within the framework of the U.N. Charter to change the regime.\n\nNow, I want to answer your second question about the conversations that Prime Minister Aznar and I have had with world leaders. The truth of the matter is, the possibility, the fact that Saddam Hussein remains in power and continues to defy the international community, there are international resolutions that have not been complied with.  The sense of urgency, you might even say the sense of fear that many world leaders have for not acting, gives me cause for optimism that some of these world leaders will reconsider their stance.\n\nIn my conversations with Vladimir, and with French President Chirac, and Gerhard Schroeder, and others, we've been pushing hard for a clear decision.  Now Presidents are not passive actors.  They have lots of problems at home, like any other leader. But the international problem of weapons of mass destruction and Saddam Hussein remains in power, that's \u2013 this country has a vital interest.  It matters. We will not abandon any effort that will move this issue forward."

You're right, I got a lot of support from some very dedicated folks of faith, and I appreciate the enthusiasm and energy they brought to the table. I think it's fair to say, however, that there are areas where we didn't necessarily achieve everything we set out to do, particularly when it comes to some of the social issues that were important to them.\n\nIf I'm being honest, I think one area where we didn't quite deliver as promised is in the area of school vouchers. Now, we did get some great successes in some of the states, particularly in No Child Left Behind, but I understand that some people were hoping to see more. \n\nAnother area is the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban, we did pass that, but unfortunately, while it's a step forward, there's still work to be done. Some people also wanted more action on the Marriage Protection Act - protecting marriage between one man and one woman, but again, that's something we did, but a lot more left to be said.\n\nNow, now, (laughs) on the issue of my reading contest with Karl Rove... (smirks)  in point of fact, those are classified documents.

I've tried to make decisions based on the information I had at the time, with the best advice I had, and with a commitment to do what I thought would make our nation safer, more secure, and more prosperous.\n\nExecution is a different beast from idea or intent. And I think it's fair to say that we fell short in some areas. Hurricane Katrina, for example, was a massive storm and a tremendous failure of government at all levels. I was disappointed, the Vice President was disappointed, and this administration was disappointed by how we responded.\n\nIn Iraq, the insurgency proved to be a more difficult enemy than we anticipated, and I think we had some flaws in our planning and execution.

On the state of Usama bin Laden, I can tell you that our military and intelligence agencies continue to pursue this enemy with every tool at our disposal.\n\nIn recent months, we've made significant progress in disrupting the Al Qaida network. We've captured or killed several key leaders, including Abu Zubaydah, who provided significant intelligence on this network. We've also made progress in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan, where Al Qaida's safe haven was established.\n\nOur military has maintained a strong presence in Afghanistan, working closely with our allies and Afghan partners to root out Al Qaida's remnants and dismantle their training camps. While we've had successes, I'd be naive to say we've achieved complete disruption. The nature of this enemy is a network of sleeper cells and operatives in far-flung locations, and we have to remain vigilant and proactive to stay ahead of their plans.\n\nRegarding Usama bin Laden, I can categorically say that we continue to pursue him, and I'm confident that if he's in a country, he'll be brought to justice. I'm not in a position to confirm whether he's dead or alive today, but I can tell you that our efforts are unrelenting. It's possible that he may be hiding in the harsh mountainous terrain of the Tora Bora area, but I'm not going to give him succor or comfort by speculating on his whereabouts.\n\nNow, regarding the domestic threat, I want to reassure the American people that we're working around the clock to ensure that Al Qaida's cells and supporters in this country don't have the opportunity to strike. In fact, since September 11th, we've worked with the Congress to pass several pieces of legislation to improve our intelligence gathering capabilities and our domestic security measures.\n\nI'd say we're in a better position now than we were six months ago, in terms of preventing attacks in the United States. But, I'm always cautious to say that in the world of terrorism, there's no such thing as 100% security. Intelligence services are ongoing, we're working together with local law enforcement, and we'll continue to adapt and improve our capabilities to keep America safe."

Let me tell you, the United States has a deep commitment to the people of Lebanon and to the stability of the region.\n\nFirst and foremost, it's essential to understand the complexities of this conflict. The Israeli military action into Lebanon was a response to Hizbollah's provocation, which had to be dealt with. While the cease-fire agreement provides a chance for calm, it's also crucial that we recognize that there are tremendous differences among the parties involved, and it's going to take time to iron out the disputes.\n\nNow, I understand that the European allies who've committed troops have expressed some reservations, and I appreciate their commitment to Lebanon's reconstruction and stability. We're working closely with our international partners to ensure that the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has the resources and the authority it needs to be effective.\n\nWe're also committed to supporting the Cedar Revolution's aspirations for democracy and freedom in Lebanon.

We're prepared to take further action if necessary to protect Lebanon's sovereignty, stability and the safety of its people.\n\nLet me emphasize that our international partners and we, as members of the international community, are committed to this effort.

Those who served in uniform, in fact all Americans, deserve our gratitude and our respect for their service.  \n\nOur exit from Vietnam is often cited as an example of a failed policy, but the fact remains, the goal was different back then. We went to Vietnam to stop the spread of communism, at that moment and time. The  principals - atrocities and brutality of communist North Vietnam were of immediate threat at the peak of the Cold War.\n\nAs for Iraq, our goals are different. Saddam Hussein's regime was a threat to its people and its neighbors, and more than that, possessed the capability and resources to threaten the United States directly through weapons of mass destruction. In 9/11, we saw a terrible manifestation of those threats, and in this case, we had clear intelligence that Saddam Hussein's regime had WMD capabilities. We have faith in the inspectors from the UN and we had every reason to believe that those WMDs still existed. \n\nI understand the uncertainty of the future and our own vulnerabilities. I want to assure the American people that I, the administration, and our military,  will do everything in our power to complete this mission successfully and return in the safest and most swift manner possible.

While there are still some differences to work out, I'm optimistic that we can find a resolution that addresses the concerns of all parties involved.\n\nAs you know, our united nations resolution would condemn the security council to take action in response to Iraq's refusal to comply with 17 UN resolution's. It's a clear call for inspectors to be on the ground to ascertain the intentions of Saddam and the Iraqi people.\n\nAs for Russia and France, I've had direct conversations with both Vladimir Putin and Jacques Chirac. We're making progress, and I'm confident that, with continued dialogue, we can find a way forward.\n\nNow, as for the deadline, let's be clear: we're not interested in ignoring the deadline. We're interested in giving the inspectors time to do their job, and we expect Iraq to comply fully with their obligations under UN resolution 1441. If that doesn't happen, we're prepared to take action to protect the American people and our allies.\n\nAnd to my friend, Prime Minister Aznar, I'm grateful for Spain's leadership and commitment to our shared values and goals. As we speak, Aznar and I are working together to find a united front in the Security Council. We believe that by working together, we can present a unified European position that supports our resolution and minimizes the impact on innocent civilians.\n\nFinally, as for public opinion back home, I'm confident that Americans understand the gravity of this situation and the need to take action. We're not taking anything for granted, and we're devoting significant resources to making our case to the American people.

The goal is to make sure that these Iraqi people are free and that our troops are safe, and we're making progress toward that goal.\n\nRegarding adding more troops, there are certain scenarios in which we might consider bolstering our military presence in Iraq.

While I'm not at liberty to disclose specific details, I can tell you that our intelligence efforts have thwarted several planned attacks, including plots to blow up American landmarks and poison the water supply. This program has helped to save countless lives and protect American citizens.\n\nHowever, I understand some concerns have been raised about the balance between national security and civil liberties. I want to assure the American people that we're committed to preserving our constitutional guarantees of due process and that we will continue to work with the intelligence community and the Congress to ensure that any programs in place are lawful and transparent.\n\nRegarding the issue of race and Hurricane Katrina, I want to reiterate that the response to that disaster fell short, and I take full responsibility for that. But I reject the idea that, as Commander-in-Chief, my efforts have been hampered by any racial bias. I'm proud of the progress we've made in historically black colleges and universities, and the number of minority teachers, faculty members and administrators, but I acknowledge there's still more work to be done. We've increased funding for a greater number of Pell Grants to minority students and improved faith-based measures to help housing, but I do believe there are those on the left who more often make these kinds of charges to distract.\n\nIt's also worth noting that we've made substantial progress in our efforts to reduce poverty among minority children, and our No Child Left Behind Act has helped to bring educational opportunities to many underserved communities.\n\nAs we look to the renewal of the Voting Rights Act, I'm committed to upholding the bipartisan legacy of this landmark legislation. It's our duty as a nation to protect the sacred right to vote for all citizens. We must ensure that our voting processes are secure, fair, and accessible to all, regardless of the color of one's skin or zip code.

Now, I understand there was a report from the Senate Intelligence Committee, and I respect their conclusions. However, I must correct you - the CIA and other agencies of our government did know there were links between Saddam Hussein's regime and Zarqawi and Al Qaida. \n\nNow, in terms of exhibiting a direct, explicit connection, I understand there was a difference of opinion within the intelligence community. And in hindsight, I probably could've been more precise in my language. However, I made it clear that Saddam Hussein was a state sponsor of terrorism, and one of the most dangerous regimes in the world. And by removing him from power, we've prevented further terrorist activities coming out of Iraq.\n\nNow, with respect to Zarqawi, he did operate with a certain degree of autonomy, but the consensus was, in fact, there were interactions between Saddam's regime and Zarqawi's organization. It's true that in the higher levels of Central Command, the Pentagon, and at the State Department, there was a range of views. One thing that I can assure everyone is, we made a wise decision by removing Saddam Hussein from power, and removing that regime, that gave the world a significant breadth of freedom and security."

We'll continue to work with our partners to foster economic stability, prosperity, and security in the region.\n\nIn the case of Mexico, I believe you're referring to the peso crisis in 1995. The U.S. did provide assistance to Mexico at that time, but the circumstances were different then. Our response in 1995 was part of a broader economic package designed to support Mexico's financial and trade policies, and it was implemented in close cooperation with the Mexican government and international financial institutions.\n\nSo, to answer your question, we're looking at a range of options, but any decision on direct financial aid to Argentina would be made after careful consideration of the specific circumstances and in coordination with the international community."

    "gen_response": "(clears throat) Thank you, and I appreciate the question. Now, let me answer it in my capacity as the President of the United States.\n\nAddressing your question regarding North Korea, I did indeed offer an olive branch of dialogue. Now, I want to make one thing clear: economic aid will be contingent upon North Korea's adherence to its commitments and agreements. We can't work with a country that seeks to threaten the security of the free world with its nuclear ambitions.\n\nThat being said, the United States remains committed to finding a peaceful solution to the conflict in the region. If North Korea accepts our offer to dialogue, we're willing to engage in constructive talks to discuss all issues, including our concerns about the development of nuclear weapons and human rights.\n\nRegarding sending an envoy, we do have a channel of communication through the Six-Party talks with North Korea, China, Japan, South Korea, and Russia. Our envoy would remain a key point of contact for direct communication between the United States and North Korea, should Pyongyang choose to accept our offer.\n\nNow, moving on to the summit meeting \u2013 which by the way, was a very productive meeting \u2013 I'm very pleased with the feeling that, for the first time in a very long time, we have found common ground with the North Koreans."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you, thank you for that question. First of all, I want to assure the American people that we take very seriously any threat to the safety of our friends and allies, and the fact that this plot targeted Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia is of particular concern. I'm going to be very cautious about the information available to me, but what I can tell you is that we are working closely with our international partners to investigate these allegations and to bring those responsible to justice.\n\nAs for Qadhafi and his involvement, I'll say this: we've got concerns about the regime's actions and its record on terrorism. While they have been saying the right words about renouncing terrorism, we've got to see the deeds, and we've got to see a pattern of behavior that confirms that they're serious about it.\n\nNow, with regards to the message we've sent Qadhafi, let me say that we've made it clear to him that we expect the Libyan government to cooperate fully with our efforts to investigate this plot and to bring those responsible to justice. And I've made it clear, privately and publicly, that we will not tolerate terrorism in any form. We will hold accountable those who plan, who fund, and who carry out terrorist acts. And we expect all nations, including the Libyan government, to do the same.\n\nBut let me tell you, this isn't just about Libya. It's about the global war on terror. It's about our commitment to protect our citizens, our friends, and our allies from the scourge of terrorism. And we'll continue to work with our international partners to disrupt, to dismantle, and to defeat the terrorist networks that threaten our security and our way of life."

Let me tell you, I'm committed to pushing through the Intelligence Reform Bill, and we're working hard to make that happen. I know there's some on my own side of the aisle who have concerns about certain elements of the bill, and I understand those concerns. \n\nHowever, I also believe that the events of September 11th and the intelligence failures leading up to them showed us that significant reforms are needed to ensure our country's safety and security. Now, I'm not going to shy away from working with my colleagues to find common ground and address their concerns.\n\nThe difference you're referring to is that on judges, we have a fundamental disagreement with the Democratic leadership in Congress about the qualifications of those individuals I've nominated. In this case, the Intelligence Reform Bill addresses serious gaps that have been identified by both Democrats and Republicans in our intelligence capabilities, and I'm committed to getting it done.\n\nI'll work with anybody who wants to work with me on this bill, and I'm willing to listen to their concerns and do what it takes to get it to my desk. I want to see action, not just rhetoric. And I'm confident that we can get this job done.\n\nI must say, some of the criticism I've heard regarding my leadership has been, I think, unfair. My administration has been moving forward on many fronts to reform our intelligence capabilities, and we're making progress. This bill builds on that progress, and I'm committed to getting it done. I'm not just talking the talk; I'm walking the walk."

First, let me assure the American people and the world that we're not giving up on finding Usama bin Laden. As a matter of fact, I have great confidence in our intelligence agencies, and we're working tirelessly to track down the perpetrator of 9/11, and we will continue to do so until he's brought to justice. As for the trail seeming to have gone cold, I'd like to remind you that this is a complex and ongoing operation, and it's going to take time.\n\nHowever, let me reassure the American people that we're making progress. We've had a lot of successes in dismantling al-Qaeda, and we're using a variety of methods to track down and disrupt their networks. The fact that we haven't seen bin Laden yet does not mean that we're not making progress. We're working around the clock to find him, and I have all the confidence in the world that we will find him.\n\nNow, regarding the reports of detainee treatment at Guantanamo and elsewhere, I want to tell you that the United States takes the allegations of mistreatment very seriously. The protection of any person under our custody is of the utmost importance, and we're committed to ensuring that our treatment of detainees is in accordance with American values and the principles of the Geneva Conventions.\n\nI want to emphasize that our department of defense has put in place comprehensive procedures to investigate and review allegations of abuse, and we're taking significant steps to enhance the treatment and conditions of our detainees. I understand the criticism, and I respect the concerns, but the American people understand the need for security and the need to gather intelligence information to prevent further attacks.\n\nRegarding the Guantanamo, I believe this detention facility has been, and will continue to be, a vital tool in our war on terrorism. Some of the most hardened terrorists, including Zacarias Moussaoui and Richard Reid, have provided valuable intelligence that has helped prevent attacks. So while we're working to improve the situation at Guantanamo, I firmly believe it is a vital part of our efforts to protect America and the world from another attack."

You know, I've been clear about my vision for this country, and I believe I'm making strides towards a more prosperous, more secure, and more free society for the American people. \n\nOn the record of transformation, I'd say there are several areas where my administration is truly making a lasting impact. First and foremost, we're making great progress on Homeland Security, working to protect our nation from threats both at home and abroad. Our efforts to strengthen our intelligence gathering and our ability to respond to emergencies have been crucial in keeping America safe.\n\nSecondly, we're playing a leadership role in promoting freedom and democracy around the world, from Afghanistan to Africa. We're helping to bring stability and hope to nations torn apart by conflict and tyranny.\n\nAnd thirdly, education reform and accountability in our schools are essential for the future of our great nation. We're working with bipartisan support to make sure our children receive a quality education and are prepared to compete in the 21st century workforce.\n\nNow, regarding your question on how to navigate the challenges ahead given the newly Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, I believe my leadership will stay focused on engaging with, and persuading the Congress to work with me to achieve our shared goals. I'm committed to reaching across the aisle and working in a bipartisan way, even in the face of opposition.\n\nIn fact, I was just on the phone with Majority Leader [insert house/senate leader], and we're discussing the ways in which we can find common ground and make progress on important issues like reforming Social Security and Medicare.\n\nRegarding the 2008 election, it's clear that some of the presidential hopefuls are already positioning themselves on the field.  I think the American people will have plenty of differences to evaluate, and we'll give them straight-shooting, honest talk about what I believe."

The reports you've heard about the assessment of Iraqi security forces are accurate. General Petraeus and his team have indicated that it's going to take time for the Iraqis to build their capacity to provide security for their own country. \n\nAs Commander-in-Chief, it's my duty to ensure we've got a strategy in place that takes into consideration the recommendations of our military commanders. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that transferring the responsibility to the next President is not simply a matter of 'passing on the fate of the war.' Rather, it's about making sure we've set the conditions for success. \n\nI believe we've made significant progress in reducing the violence and giving the Iraqi people the chance to build a better future. That being said, it's not going to be easy, and it's going to require a continued commitment from the American people, our military, and our allies in the region.\n\nRegarding your question about the Iraqi Prime Minister, it's an honor to address that in this press conference and I'd like to yield that portion of the Q&A to Prime Minister Maliki, who is currently in the audience."

I appreciate your question, and I'm glad to provide an update on our efforts to address the cotton subsidies issue with Benin. As you know, the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization was a critical opportunity to address the issue of agricultural subsidies, including those affecting the cotton industry in Benin and other West African countries.\n\nWhile there have been challenges in concluding the Doha Round, we have made significant progress. The African Growth and Opportunity Act, which I signed into law in 2000, included provisions to provide duty-free market access for Benin and other sub-Saharan African countries to the U.S. market. This has helped to increase trade and economic development in the region.\n\nWith regard to cotton subsidies, we have been working closely with Benin and other countries to address their concerns. I'm pleased to report that we have implemented a 2-year reduction in cotton subsidies in the United States, and we're continuing to work towards a more comprehensive solution through the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe issue of cotton subsidies is still a challenge, but it's no longer the contentious issue it was during my previous visit. Our commitment to addressing the problem remains strong, and I believe our progress has been a positive step forward. I'm pleased that we're making progress on this critical issue, and I'm committed to continuing our efforts to ensure a more level playing field for Benin's farmers and textile workers.\n\nNow, I appreciate your interest in this issue, and I'm happy to continue this conversation.

Now, regarding your question, I've made it clear that I want to see a package that has both the rate reduction and a stimulus. The two are connected, and I believe we should not leave American people to wait any longer for tax relief.\n\nI've spoken with our allies in Congress, and they agree that we should move forward on this comprehensive package that includes both the rate reduction and the stimulus. If we can pass the rate reduction and then come back later to pass a separate bill for the stimulus, I'd be willing to consider that. However, I believe our focus right now should be on getting this done in one package, as I believe it's more efficient for the economy.\n\nUltimately, our joint efforts will be driven by one simple principle: we believe America's economy is best served by giving hardworking families and small businesses a chance to keep more of their money. And that's exactly what our tax cut package will do. So, we'll continue to consult with our allies, but we should move forward on one comprehensive package, and that's the bill I'll be presenting to Congress today."

Let me tell you, we're --- we're making great progress on Social Security reform, and I appreciate the folks like Senator Kerrey and Senator Moynihan for engaging in this important conversation.\n\nNow, the criticisms about the cost associated with transitioning our Social Security program to a more sustainable, more modern system are not entirely unfounded. But I respectfully disagree that $2 trillion is an accurate assessment of that cost. Our preliminary numbers suggest it's a more modest investment, a more manageable investment.\n\nHowever, I do agree that we need to be concerned about the long-term solvency of Social Security.  I'm committed to Social Security. This program is a sacred trust that the American people have obligated government to protect, and I'm not going to let it fail.\n\nYou know, our plan includes giving workers the option to set aside part of their payroll taxes in personal retirement accounts. These accounts would grow with the free market, providing better returns on investment than the current system, ensuring that folks have more control and ownership over their own retirement savings.\n\nRegarding the transition costs, we propose paying off any interest costs associated with the transition over a period of many years. We're not going to ask you, if you will, to start writing some huge checks that people cannot afford, so our proposal is finanziaily responsible and more optimistic than we thought under the old system of cash flushing.\n\nThis summer, I plan to work with  the Congress to put forth a specific Social Security reform proposal, one that does not raise taxes, one that does not cut any benefits, and one that gives workers a realistic and agreeable option.\n\nNow, I know the details will be complex, and there will be significant public discussion. I've always said it is a long run thing."

The decision to go to the hospital was made by the Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales, not by me.\n\nAs the President, I was confident that the Attorney General, John Ashcroft, or the Deputy Attorney General, James Comey, would make a decision to reauthorize the terrorist surveillance program.

The media, including that fine publication Time Magazine with Matt Cooper, during our time the Bush administration allowed more than 40 Congressional briefings, included leading senior administration officials, involved in developing that program and facts have been made clear, they were monitoring communications of Americans' but the concern was and is what they have been doing on the outside, and I still stand behind this particular program and changed our laws."

On the first part of that question, I'm not confident in the characterizations of the relationship between two governments when it comes to potential military action. I've made it very clear to the Israeli government that any military strikes against Iran would be - would be a grave error. [pauses] Israel is a very capable democracy, a strong ally of the United States and they've got a sovereign right to make their own decisions. However, I've also made clear to them that any military action must be in our collective interest, and whether or not that this is in the interest of both the United States and Israel, I remain to be seen.\n\nSecondly, with regard to your other question about Iran, look, these mixed messages are not particularly unique when it comes to dealing with the Iranian government, I'll tell you. [pauses briefly] They're a regime known for its unpredictability, it's a regime known for its defiance, it's a regime known for its hostility towards civilized humanity. At the same time, they say one thing at the U.N. [United Nations] and they say another thing, or they make promises and then they break them. The bottom line is we're not concerned with what they say, we're concerned with what they do."

We believe this is an important step to move towards reducing the overcrowding in our prison system and to give people a second chance.\n\nNow, as for the pardons for Dan Barton, Gen. Jay Garner, and five other individuals, these decisions were made based on a review of the facts and the circumstances surrounding their convictions and service to our nation. Each of these individuals made significant contributions to our military and our government, and we believe a pardon is warranted in these cases.\n\nNow, looking back at the history of America, yes, I believe we are learning from the lessons of the past. We know that a president has a unique opportunity to reflect the values of our society, and we've taken that to heart. Ultimately, the decision to grant pardons or commutations lies with the discretion of the President, as spelled out under the U.S. Constitution.

While it's true that we've been watching closely as the process has played out, I must say, there's been a lot of activity on our part, behind the scenes, working closely with various factions - the Israelis, the Palestinians, the Egyptians, the Saudi Arabs, the Kuwaitis, and others.\n\nWhile it's true that there's been an escalation in violence and rhetoric, I believe our efforts have been pivotal in working towards the process of peace. I think what's most important, though, is that all parties - all parties involved - accept the necessity of two states living side-by-side in peace, and respecting each other's sovereignty and security.\n\nThe implication that stepping back on a more public stage would somehow serve as a catalyst for peace rather than fueling violence is simply incorrect. Our inaction would leave a power vacuum that would - that would destabilize the entire region and that creates a vacuum for unconquerable obstacles.\n\nIn reality, I firmly believe that under our current plans for increased diplomatic efforts, working quietly behind the scenes, carefully coordinating with multiple parties and friends will successfully result in an eventual successful resolution. We will continue to remain engaged, and the Office of the President will continue to stay alongside everyone involved in the process, sharing ideas, negotiation, openness, state to state, and side by side."

The purpose of this situation is to neutralize the Taliban and al-Qaeda, and create a more stable environment throughout the region. \n\nAs you mentioned, Prime Minister Blair has been working closely with our team, and we intend to follow up on his ideas for a post-Taliban Afghanistan, making sure that it aligns itself with our efforts for stability in the region.\n\nRegarding King Zahir Shah, the 139-late Shah did have an impact on the potential governance of Afghanistan. His son, as well - Zahir Shah's son - does indeed have, potentially, a significant role in an Afghan government, seeing as he does represent the country's former ruler, who King Zahir Shah's past presence did indicate a chance of bringing some form of stability.\n\nHowever, as of now, an interim government composed of a variety of elements, including moderate politicians who we enable here might indeed hold the country together post-Taliban era, in the hopes that it will best withstands both internal challenges and external pressures.\n\nThat's all for now."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question. I've heard that argument, and I respect the concern. However, I strongly disagree with that analysis. First, let me be clear: the threat posed by Saddam Hussein is very real. We've seen his pattern of aggression, his history of developing weapons of mass destruction, and his sponsorship of terrorism. The Iraq Survey Group in 2005 found that Iraq did indeed have an active WMD program, which is what led me to make the decision to go in there in the first place.\n\nWhile I understand the concern about creating more terrorists, I simply don't agree that going into Iraq would create a new set of terrorists who want to harm the United States. In fact, I believe that removing Saddam Hussein from power and liberating the Iraqi people from his regime will ultimately help defeat the ideology of terrorism.\n\nWe've seen how these dictatorships can breed terrorism. Now that Saddam's gone, we've had a chance to see the Iraqis begin to build a democracy, and that gives me confidence that we've made a significant step forward. The creation of new terrorists would only be the result if we were to continue to let dictators like Saddam go unchallenged. I truly believe the path we've taken in Iraq has led to a safer world for America and for allies around the world.\n\nNow, I know there's a school of thought out there that says, \"if we just diplomatically isolate Saddam, he'll eventually disarm, and then we can go back to being friends and allies.\" I disagree. I don't see that that's the way Saddam works. I've seen how he's used manipulation and deceit to hide his intentions and continue with his programs. He's not interested in disarming; he's interested in pursuing his own ideology and holding onto power.\n\nIn conclusion, I understand the concern, but I firmly believe that dealing with Saddam fundamentally is not just about stopping him from developing WMDs, it's about destroying a society that breeds terror and generates hatred for the United States."

And I believe that the role of faith in public life is an important one. As a man of faith, I believe that my values and my faith guide my decision-making, and I think that's the case for many Americans.\n\nNow, I understand that not everyone shares my faith, and that's okay. The beauty of America is that we have a system that protects the rights of people to worship as they see fit, or to not worship at all. And I believe that as President, my duty is to represent all Americans, regardless of their faith.\n\nI think it's a concern, and a rightful concern, of many Americans when they see people using their faith to proselytize or to impose their will on others. But as President, I've made it clear that my vision for America is one that's inclusive, one that's based on biblical values of compassion, of love, and of justice.\n\nNow, I think it's also worth noting that many people of faith, including Christians, are concerned about issues such as poverty, and the environment, and human rights, and these are all issues that I've made a priority as President. And I'd say to those who are concerned about the role of faith in public life, that I believe that faith should inform our public policy, but it shouldn't dictate it. We should welcome people of all faiths, and of no faith, to be a part of the conversation about how to build a better America.\n\nSo I'd be happy to work with people of all faiths, including those whose views may differ from my own, to address the great challenges facing this country. But I do believe that the values of faith can be a source of strength, a source of comfort, and a source of inspiration for all Americans.\n\nAnd let me say, as I've said before, that the phrase 'you're either with us or against us' was not meant to describe people of other faiths, it was meant to describe those who would stand with us in the face of tyranny and oppression. There are a lot of people of good will, people of faith, who hold differing views on a lot of issues, and I'm committed to reaching out and working with those people to build a more perfect union."

My remarks were aimed at condemning those who misuse their faith to justify violence and hatred. They should not be taken as a reflection of the peaceful and tolerant nature of the Muslim faith as a whole.\n\nRegarding the Pope's comments, I understand the concerns that were raised.

Nevertheless, I share the Pope's regret for any offense caused and I appreciate his efforts to reaffirm the values of mutual respect and understanding that are at the heart of our shared human quest for peace and coexistence.\n\nTo promote interfaith harmony, I believe it's essential for leaders and people of faith to work together to build bridges and challenge extremism. The United States, under the leadership of my administration and the support of the international community, will continue to fight terrorism, promote democracy, and support freedom of conscience and expression.\n\nNow, as for working with President Musharraf and others to build these bridges, yes, that is exactly what I'm committed to do.

However, making progress - it's a tough issue, it takes time, it takes effort. I was encouraged by some of the meetings and the negotiations I had, but there's still much to be done.\n\nAs for the linkage to Iraq, I think we've got to deal with the Middle East in total, not just pieces of the Middle East. And so, if the arrogant dictatortries, Saddam Hussein, gets back the ability to support terror, that's a threat not just to Israel, not just to the United States but to the entire region - that's why removing him from power is essential."

First, I want to say that the surge has been working. I know there's been a lot of talk about benchmarks, and the benchmarks are important. But I think it's also important to look at the progress we've made on the ground.\n\nSince the surge, we've seen a significant decrease in sectarian violence, particularly in the capital city of Baghdad. We've seen the Iraqi security forces taking on more responsibility, and they're making progress. We've seen the Maliki government taking steps to disarm the militias, to reduce violence, and to move towards a more inclusive government.\n\nNow, I know there are challenges, and we're not going to get everything done in a hurry. But I believe we can make progress, and I believe that progress is being made. And I think it's shortsighted to say that the sacrifice of our troops is in vain. Our troops are making a difference, and they're changing the dynamics in Iraq.\n\nI want to put it in a different perspective. When I walked into this office, Iraq was a failing state. Saddam Hussein was in power, and we were faced with a terrorist in Baghdad. We worked very hard to remove Saddam Hussein and the terrorists, and we created a vacuum. And we had a responsibility to stabilize the region.\n\nI've often said it's like clearing the rubble of an earthquake. You take the rubble out, but you still have to build the building. And that's what we're doing in Iraq. We're clearing the rubble, and we're building. And I believe that our troops are a major part of that process.\n\nI'm willing to work with Congress to try to find a way forward. We're willing to work with the Iraqis to try to meet these benchmarks. But we're not going to just walk away from this. We've made a commitment to the Iraqi people, and we're going to see it through.\n\nI understand the concern about Senator McCain's visit. I've talked to John about that. I think that's a good thing. I want more members of Congress to go to Iraq. I want them to see for themselves what's happening on the ground. I think it's an important part of democracy. We need to have a national debate about this, based on facts, not just speculation or second-guessing.\n\nAnd I urge the American people to keep the faith in our armed forces. They're doing a great job, and they deserve our support. I'm proud of them, and I'm going to continue to stand by them."

Chancellor Merkel's here with me today, and I appreciate her insights and leadership on this very important issue.\n\nYou're correct, we have been makin' progress on addressin' the climate challenge. And I believe that's why it's so crucial that we keep buildin' on that momentum. Our administration has made significant investments in renewable energy, increased fuel efficiency standards for vehicles, and taken steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And I'm proud to say that America's reductions in CO2 emissions are among the largest of any developed nation.\n\nNow, I understand that there may be differences in approach between the United States and Europe on the best way to meet our climate goals. And I agree with the Chancellor that a voluntary approach can be an effective way to encourage businesses and countries to take meaningful action without stiflin' economic growth.\n\nThe European Union's emissions trading system, their cap-and-trade approach, is a valid alternative, and we're lookin' at it closely. So, I don't see it as an either-or situation; I think we can explore different ways to work together to achieve our common goals.\n\nBut make no mistake, the clock is indeed tickin', and we need to keep pushin' forward. The challenges we face are real, and the consequences of inaction are clear. So I'm glad to be workin' together with Chancellor Merkel and other world leaders to find common ground and make progress on this important issue.\n\nAnd let me just say, I'm remainin' optimistic that we can do it. I believe that with American ingenuity, European leadership, and a shared commitment to the environment, we can find a way to balance our economic and environmental needs and get the job done.\n\nI'd like to ask the Chancellor to add any thoughts she might have on this matter."

As you know, I've always believed that the actions of our intelligence community are critical to the national security of this country, and I take very seriously the trust that is required in those who serve in that capacity.\n\nRegarding the specific matter at hand \u2013 the leak of Valerie Plame's name \u2013 I have stated my position on this matter before. I do not condone leaks, and I believe it's a serious matter when national security information is compromised.\n\nAs for my senior advisers, I have expressed my concern to them, and I have made it clear that leaking the name of a covert CIA operative was unacceptable. I expect the highest level of professionalism, integrity, and discretion from my advisors, and I'm confident that they understand that.\n\nHowever, I cannot speak about private conversations I may have had with specific individuals regarding this matter. Let me make it clear that as Commander-in-Chief, I had to weigh many factors in making my decision regarding Scooter Libby, and that decision was based on the laws and facts presented to me as I saw them at the time.\n\nI want to make one thing clear: I'm responsible for the decisions I made, and I stand by them. While I have expressed my concern regarding the leak, I believe it's essential to move forward, focusing on the future and our national security efforts, rather than rehashing the past."

As I stated at the signing ceremony with Speaker Pelosi and Senator Reid, the new energy bill is an important step forward in addressing America's energy needs and reducing our reliance on foreign sources of energy. I believe that combating climate change is a pressing issue, and we have to take coordinated action to address it.\n\nHowever, I must clarify that the federal government and the states must work within the bounds of the law. While I support efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, federal law takes precedence over state regulations. In this case, the existing federal law, the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, prohibits states from setting their own emission standards unless they can prove they would have a major impact on the global market. California's plan would have precisely that impact, so, out of a commitment to the rule of law and our growth in the global market, I had to inform the governor that we cannot allow the state's plan to stand.\n\nWith regard to my conversation with Vice President Gore, I did speak with Al Gore last month about our shared commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. He and I share a common goal: clean air and clean water for America's people. I'm pleased we could have an open discussion and understanding on this very important issue."

The relationship between the United States and Benin has been built on strong foundations, as you mentioned, dating back 47 years. And I'm proud to say that we're taking it to the next level.\n\nAs President, I've always believed in engaging with nations that share our values and are committed to democracy, freedom, and human rights. Benin has been a stalwart partner in the international community, and I'm committed to building on this partnership.\n\nOur cooperation will focus on areas such as economic development, health, education, and security. We'll work together to promote economic opportunities, improve the living standards of the Beninese people, and enhance regional stability.\n\nThis visit is a reflection of the growing bilateral ties between our nations, and I'm confident that our new partnership will lead to tangible, positive changes in Benin and in the region. It's not a stunt, it's a genuine commitment to a new chapter in our relationship.\n\nNow, I'd like to emphasize that history has been made, but it's just the beginning.

You're right, there are many positive signs, and we're committed to supporting those efforts.\n\nAs you know, the work we're doing in Africa is multifaceted. We're working to combat HIV/AIDS, to help countries develop sustainable economic growth, and to strengthen their institutions. And we're doing this through a combination of bilateral and multilateral efforts, working with partners, nongovernmental organizations, and working closely with international organizations like the United Nations.\n\nWhen we evaluate how to allocate our time and resources, I have to make a tough analysis of where we can have the greatest positive impact. And I've told my team that our approach should be to focus on the high-impact efforts, the efforts that are most likely to help vulnerable populations and to create lasting change.\n\nNow, as you pointed out, there are places where progress is harder to find, and that's why we're also working to help countries build peace and stability. In some of these areas, like the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda, we've been working to support the African Union and African-led peacekeeping efforts.\n\nSo, we will continue to evaluate our efforts in Africa and make sure that our resources are being used in the most effective way possible to make a positive difference in people's lives.\n\nYou know, Laura and I have seen firsthand the devastating effects of HIV/AIDS when we visited Uganda. The ravaging it brings, the loss of hope, the impact on families. And I want to make it clear, the United States is committed to helping provide aid, assistance to those affected by HIV/AIDS, and to finding a cure.\n\nWe're working closely with Nelson Mandela, Bill Gates, and others to try and come up with new strategies for tackling this effort.\n\nIn this case, we're guided by a creed expressed by the Secretary of State Colin Powell, 'soft power' sure can solve some problems but that harder hungrier and more desperate problems, need 'smart power', to use some of the diplomatic, political, and use tools of statecraft, and so we will keep following that mantra, we will keep using the, 'smart power' issue."

It's an area of discussion that my administration has been working on for some time now. We have signed several energy agreements, particularly with nations such as Mexico and Canada.\n\nOne of them is the M\u00e9rida Initiative, where the United States has made commitments to support a clean and energy-efficient avenues in conjunction with those countries. For this hemispheric-wide energy plan to be equitable, it's essential that we look at the infrastructure build-up required for this, as a vital energy corridor that links the United States, Canada, and our Latin American partners for the efficient transportation of oil and gas.\n\nAdditionally, we must ensure a strategic relationship between the energy sectors of the United States and Mexico, promoting energy exploration and production, and ensuring greater access to the Gulf of Mexico's energy potential, to meet the rising demands in the future as capabilities of energy use rise across the American hemisphere.\n\nFor me, I believe it's time to take the energy revolution needed to push forward the Auto- Efficient Fuel standard which makes use of technology to create an unified coordinated stance as all countries have different targets requiring for achieving the suiitble automotove ratio.

And I still believe that's where the American people are.\n\nRegarding the question about my brother Governor Bush's decision in Florida, I support that decision. I also understand the awful circumstances surrounding the Terri Schiavo case. It was a tragic situation, and I believe my brother listened to the concerns of the nation and took action after the legislative efforts to intervene in the case had failed.\n\nIn this case, the Florida legislature had taken over 60 votes in both the House and Senate to intervene, and not to allow the removal of life support. My brother signed that legislation to prevent the removal of life support. So, I appreciate that effort."

We've made it clear that Saddam Hussein must be held accountable for his crimes against humanity, for his atrocities against his own people, and for his blatant disregard for the international community. We will not negotiate with a man who has refused to disarm, has pursued weapons of mass destruction, and has violated the terms of multiple UN resolutions.\n\nWe're not interested in negotiating with him; we're interested in defeating him and bringing him to justice. The final showdown for Saddam Hussein is at hand, and it's not going to be in some palace in Baghdad or some tent in Iraq; it's going to be on the firing line.\n\nNow, I appreciate your mentioning the soldier's alleged comment to Saddam. Our soldiers are doing their job admirably over there, and I'm proud of them. And as for my greeting to Saddam Hussein, I'd say this: the greeting from me to him is that he's a man who's brought untold suffering to his people, who's murdered thousands of innocents, and who's responsible for a genocidal regime."

I appreciate General Abizaid's professionalism and his assessment of the facts on the ground. I also appreciate the Vice President's, uh, optimism, let's call it, about the progress we're making.\n\nYou see, we're at a point in this war where we're not just fighting an enemy that's external, but also trying to build a new government, and, uh, get the basics of governance going. This is not a easy task, folks. We're dealing with, you know, high expectations and a history of, uh, conflict, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it, it's tough out there.\n\nThe Vice President's comments, I think, reflect my own optimism about the progress we're making. I mean, we've made good progress in certain parts of the country, we've had some hard-won battles, and there's, uh, definitely some reason for hope. On the other hand, I have no doubt that General Abizaid's assessment is also correct. We still have a lot to do.\n\nYou see, the point is, we're at a, uh, moral and military plateau, where we're moving forward, but it's a slow and steady pace. We're not where we want to be yet, but I assure the American people, we're working hard every day to get to that point where we can start to bring our troops home, but with a sovereign, uh, Iraq that can take care of itself.\n\nI think what's happening here is, you got two perspectives, both of which are valid, but they're, uh, different. The Vice President's optimism is justified, but General Abizaid's caution is justified too. And we're working on both fronts, understanding the situation on the ground and trying to move forward, but we'll always tell the American people the truth about the progress we're making."

It involves increasing the domestic production of oil and natural gas, building more refineries, promoting alternative sources of energy, and improving our energy efficiency.\n\nSome of the steps we took included the opening up of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas exploration, and encouraging the development of new refining capacity. I also supported the use of clean coal technology and nuclear power. \n\nIn terms of alternative energy, our budget included a significant increase in funding for research and development of renewable energy technologies such as wind, solar, and hydrogen fuel cells. My team also worked with the Congress to pass the Zero-Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, which I believe will help reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nI'm proud of the progress we made in that first term, but I'm also aware that rising gas prices, as you pointed out, are eroding many Americans' bottom line. Today's situation is part of a global trend, driven by global oil demand, geopolitical tension, and other factors. \n\nHowever, as President, I am committed to finding solutions to these challenges. We've re-structured my policies and we are taking additional steps to enhance oil and natural gas production, to improve refineries' efficiency, and to increase the use of alternative fuels."

And there's a great deal of concern about their pursuit of nuclear capabilities, and their support of terrorism. Now, there's a lot of skepticism out there about Iraq, and there's skepticism of our policy among some of our friends around the world, but we're not deterred by the criticism.\n\nIn fact, we're getting a pretty settled view in the non-persuaded multitude - that the reason we've had some criticism on Iraq, it's not because we were wrong about Saddam Hussein. We removed a dangerous man who could have wounded us, and we've helped to liberate a nation in the process. True, our freedom troops are doing their job, but establishing a fledgling democracy is a tough endeavor, and it's moving forward.\n\nAnd now, concerning the idea that Mr. Allawi's [Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi] efforts were somehow a slap in the face of this administration, I've seen Mr. Allawi. We like him a great deal. He's a brave man. He's taking on a really tough job in a difficult time. And he's getting his house in order. And we'll work with him to ensure that the right steps are being taken to protect Iraq from the instability that emanates from western neighbor, Iran.\n\nMake no mistake about it, the free world demands that there not be interference in Iraq. The free world demands that they allow the Iraqi people to make their own decisions. And I believe, after seeing Prime Minister Allawi, that he is committed to the fight again terrorism, and committed to the rebuilding of his nation, and to the rights of the Iraqi people to be free from Iranian influence.\n\nNow, we've made it clear that if necessary, we're prepared to take action towards Iran, but we want to get a broad international consensus.

I've heard the criticisms, and I respectfully disagree with the notion that we didn't send enough troops or that we didn't have a strategic vision for the mission.\n\nLet me tell you, the decision to go to war in Iraq was based on a clear and compelling rationale: to remove a threat to our national security. Saddam Hussein's regime was a sponsor of terror, a proliferator of WMD, and a oppressive dictator who was harming his own people. We had it pretty clear that removing him would make the world a safer place, especially for the American people.\n\nNow, in terms of troop strength, I made the decision, in consultation with my generals and advisors, to send a force that would accomplish our mission objectives. We sent the 3rd Infantry Division, the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, and the 1st Armored Division. We also committed to maintaining a sufficient force to secure the country and transition to the Iraqis to take over.\n\nNow, you're right, Al Qaida did try to exploit the vacuum that followed the fall of Baghdad. But we went on the offensive and pushed them back. And I believe we made significant progress against Al Qaida, its leadership, and its support structure in Iraq. We also established provincial reconstruction teams to help build the capacity of the Iraqi government and the security forces to take on the job of fighting terrorism.\n\nIn terms of reconciliation, we also had a plan to establish a new Iraqi government, one that would represent the will of the Iraqi people. And that's exactly what happened. We had a constitutional referendum, a transfer of sovereignty, and democratic elections. We worked closely with our Iraqi partners to help them build institutions and develop their own security forces.\n\nI remember when President Bush, in his optimism, speech at the U.N some time ago declared a screen that would prove to hold that Goal to go no better than us to have focused insistently proven for the alternate horizons restored security for the world by publishing low effectiveness weapons development welcomes Iraq heroes when every progress made at that without emphasizing alternate pathway defeat insisted capitals Laos greens.

We knew at the time, and still know, that Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator who posed a threat to his own people, the region, and the world. We took action based on the best intelligence available to us at the time, and I've always been confident that our decision was a right one.\n\nAs for any regrets, I would say that I'm proud of the service of our men and women in uniform who are still in harm's way. I'm proud of the sacrifices they've made, and I'm proud of the progress we've made in Iraq towards stability and democracy.\n\nRegarding Afghanistan, I think it's true that the international community, at the time, was focused on responding to the 9/11 attacks, and we took action in Afghanistan to root out al-Qaeda and the Taliban. However, it's also true that the subsequent invasion of Iraq diverted resources and attention away from Afghanistan. We've rededicated ourselves to victory in Afghanistan, and I believe that's the right priority.\n\nNow, regarding the Prime Minister, I don't think Tony's sentiments about Iraq are relevant here, and mine either. Both of us did what we thought was right at the time, and while history's judgment may vary, I believe we acted with the best interests of our respective countries in mind.\n\nAs for the Lisbon Treaty, I was asked about it during my presidency, and my position on the UK's decision to join the European Union remains unchanged. However, I don't believe that's the focus of your question. It seems to me you're asking an opinion about where this process goes next in Europe, and I'll say that institutions and processes take time to mature.

I think they asked our country to cut back on certain emissions without recognizing the growth and dynamism and the economic growth in countries like China and India.\n\nAnd the treaty was negotiated in a way that disadvantaged the United States. We're the only major industrialized country that didn't ratify and initial the treaty. And I think it was unfair to impose severe economic burdens on the United States without asking other countries to do the same.\n\nNow, I know some folks have criticized my decision as based on emotion, but let me tell you, these were not emotional decisions. These were decisions that were based on careful analysis and discussion with experts and with Congress. We looked at what this treaty would mean for our economy and for American workers, and we concluded that it would be a mistake to impose those burdens without broader international cooperation.\n\nAs for the criticism from European countries, I think it's an easy thing to criticize, but I'd rather engage in constructive dialogue about these issues.

The investigation into these attacks is ongoing, and we're working closely with our federal, state, and local authorities to try to determine the source and the perpetrator of these heinous acts.\n\nNow, regarding Afghanistan, I can confirm that we do have special operations forces in southern Afghanistan working in direct support of our operations against Al Qaida and the Taliban regime in that country.\n\nAnd to answer the third part of your question, to our host, it's for you to make that decision, not for me to say. But I will say that the United Nations resolution 1368, which I will sign later today, demands that the Taliban hand over the leaders of Al Qaida in Afghanistan, and it resolves that member states are authorized to use all necessary means to hold those responsible for the 9/11 attacks accountable. I believe that it is our duty and our responsibility to protect the American people, and I have directed our military to launch a campaign to eradicate the terrorist organization that planned and carried out the 9/11 attacks.\n\nA little later, I will be signing the United Nations resolution demanding that the Taliban hand over to a recognized authority of Afghanistan the terrorists responsible for the 9/11 attacks, Osama bin Laden and other key leaders of the terrorist network responsible for the attacks. The United States and numerous other nations, including Russia, China, and Islamic states, are part of this global coalition. We're at the beginning stages of a military campaign, and we have many challenges ahead, but I'm confident about the outcome.\n\nRegarding a timeline for the duration of this military operation, I don't want to give a precise timeline to the enemy, but we're looking at a campaign of months, not years. We will be working hard to ensure that this campaign results in the defeat of the terrorists, and in bringing those responsible for 9/11 to justice."

    "gen_response": "(pausing for a moment) I'll tell you exactly what happened. I was on the board of Harken Oil and Gas, and I was concerned about the financial health of the company. We were facing financial difficulties at the time. We sold the Aloha Petroleum subsidiary in 1989. The sale price was determined by an independent third-party appraisal, and I was not directly involved in the process.\n\nNow, as to the accounting treatment of the sale, I was not in a position to question or participate in the accounting judgment made by the company's financial team. My role as a board member was to advise and make strategic decisions, but I was not directly involved in the day-to-day accounting operations.\n\nRegarding the restatement of earnings by the SEC, I didn't know anything about any wrongdoing or impropriety at the time. I relied on the company's financial experts to ensure compliance with accounting standards. In hindsight, I may have been too trusting. But let me tell you, I thought I was acting in good faith.\n\n(edited part of quote REMOVED due future initatement policy from corporate board material  related to act)\n\nWith regards to the credibility on corporate responsibility, I'll tell you this: I've spent my entire life according to the law and according to the highest standards of ethics. I've always sought to lead by example. The issue here is a technical accounting matter from 20 years ago. While I take full responsibility for my actions, I believe that I acted as any director would have under similar circumstances.\n\nAs the leader of this nation, I'll give you assurance, my administration is committed to accounting transparency, fairness, and the highest levels of ethics."

    "gen_response": "That's a fine question, and it's a timely one, given the context of the times we're living in. As I see it, the era we're in today isn't exactly comparable to the turn of the last century, but there are certainly similar concerns that need to be addressed.\n\nAs I've said before, my administration has taken steps to promote corporate responsibility, particularly with regards to financial regulation and corporate governance. We've also made a conscious effort to reach out to the business community, to listen to their concerns, and to work together to find common ground.\n\nHowever, I do agree with you that there are concerns about corporate influence and the impact it has on our democracy. And I believe that the American people deserve to know that their government is working for them, not just for the interests of special interests and corporations.\n\nNow, should I be speaking out as directly and as forcefully as Theodore Roosevelt did? I think it's worth considering, but our approach has been different in many ways. We've sought to work with Congress to pass legislation that promotes accountability and transparency, and we've taken executive actions to hold corporations accountable when they break the rules.\n\nI think it's also worth noting that we've made significant progress in areas like corporate governance, particularly with the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. That law was a response to corporate failures like Enron and WorldCom, and it established new standards for corporate accountability and oversight.\n\nSo while I don't think we're exactly in the same situation as 100 years ago, I do think that corporate accountability is a critical issue that needs to be addressed. We'll continue to take steps to promote fairness, transparency, and accountability, and I'll continue to speak out when I see efforts that are not in the best interests of the American people."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question.  I appreciate the opportunity to address the many expectations and hopes of those who supported me in this election. I must say, I'm grateful for their enthusiasm.\n\nFirst and foremost, let me assure you that I'll be working closely with the new Congress to advance the conservative agenda that resonated with the American people. Now, let's be clear - I still believe Social Security needs reform. The system is facing a significant financial challenge, and if we don't address it, future generations will bear the brunt.\n\nHowever, the American people also understand that we can't simply privatize it overnight. We need a phased-in approach that protects current beneficiaries and current workers, especially those on the lower and middle-income brackets who can least afford it. We'll be studying the best options and consulting with lawmakers to find a solution that protects the trust fund and ensures the long-term solvency of the program.\n\nRegarding abortion, I continue to be pro-life. I remain committed to the protection of life, and we'll continue to work with pro-life groups to achieve that goal. However, we also need to respect the will of the American people and the importance we place on choice. Any legislation we pursue must respect the existing pro-choice laws in various states.\n\nOn the judges, I am committed to appointing fair-minded and qualified nominees who reflect the values Americans care about: justice, equality, and the rule of law. We'll be considering the recommendations of various conservative groups, but the bottom line is that I'll champion justices who are committed to interpreting the Constitution, not making it.\n\nFinally, on the tax code, we all agree - it's in dire need of a simple and fair overhaul. Americans and businesses deserve a tax code that promotes economic growth, not hinders it. We will urge Congress to put partisanship aside and work with us to find real solutions that make America more competitive in the world market.\n\nSeizing the moment, as your question suggests, means embracing the opportunity to advance, not continuing business as usual. We're going to take a step-by-step approach, be guided by pragmatism and bipartisanship, and be willing to work with our opponents when it serves the greater interest of the country."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you. My fellow American citizen, let me tell you, we are deeply concerned about the situation in the Middle East, and we're committed to a two-state solution. We believe that a Palestinian state, living beside Israel, is in Israel's interest, in the Palestinian people's interest, and in America's interest.\n\nNow, with regards to the settlements, we have made it clear that we don't think they should be expanded beyond what's already existed prior to 1967. And we have, on occasion, expressed our concerns about some of these new settlement activities. But, I want to assure you that we're trying to walk a delicate path here, between Israel, a close friend, and a trusted ally, and the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people.\n\nAs for the security fence, we understand Israel's need to secure its citizens, but we do have concerns about its impact on daily life for Palestinians. And we'll continue to work with the Israelis and the Palestinians to try to find a solution that addresses Israel's security concerns while minimizing the humanitarian impact on Palestinian civilians.\n\nNow, as for concrete action, let me tell you, we've been working behind the scenes, pressing for a two-state solution, advocating for the road map that the international community has endorsed. We've been working with the Palestinian leadership to ensure that they're meeting their obligations under the Quartet's plan \u2013 that includes reforming their governing structures, combating terrorism, and strengthening their economy.\n\nAnd, of course, we're working with Israel to get them to take some actions as well.  Our envoys, including our Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, have been actively engaged in these efforts, and we'll continue to push for progress in the days and weeks ahead.\n\nBut, I'll tell you this \u2013 there's no easy solution to this conflict. I was proud to stand in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, in '98, and talk about the importance of a two-state solution, and I believe firmly in that vision today. We just got a lot of work to do to get there."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you, glad you brought that up. Let's get one thing straight: I'm proud of our economic record. We've created millions of new jobs, wages are rising, and America is winning the global economic competition. I'm not worried about legacy deficits as long as we're facing the fundamental challenge of Medicare, which we need to reform, and the structural deficit that we're dealing with.\n\nNow, I think it's fair to say that my opponent's criticism sounds a bit like, well, Harry Truman's campaign slogan back in 1948: \"The buck stops here.\" My opponent doesn't have a clear, credible plan to address our nation's fiscal challenges, but I do. And my plan to readjust the trajectory of our deficits is based on reform, not just cuts.\n\nYou're right about my father's record in the '92 campaign. I remember it well. And that's exactly why I'm committed to communicating our successes to the American people. It's a common-sense question: if we are cutting taxes and keeping an economy growing, then why not take credit for it?\n\nSo this week and next is going to be about foreign policy. This is about national security and the War on Terror, it's about judging who can keep America safe and who has a clear vision for victory and a humble foreign policy that's going to recognize the partnership of all Western nations. So, I'm in this election to win it. And I trust the American people to see through the partisan haze and to know the direction that our country needs to take.\n\nNow, I will say, we do face a time of consequence here at home. The No Child Left Behind Act, which was realized when I signed it into law, increased scores in reading and math. There have been $1.6 billion awarded to our schools to motivate kids and, we have to, give teachers the support they need. My opponent just voted against this landmark achievement."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for that question.  I appreciate the kind sentiments expressed by the Canadian people back in 2001. It was a difficult time for both our countries, and it's a reminder that in times of crisis, we stand together as friends and allies.\n\nAs for the divergence you spoke of, I think there have been several factors at play since 9/11. First and foremost, we've been engaged in two major conflicts, one in Afghanistan and then second in Iraq. These conflicts have naturally caused a lot of tension and disagreement, particularly with regards to the decision to go to war in Iraq.\n\nI think also that there have been differing opinions on issues such as the best way to approach terrorism, how to balance security with liberty, and the role of the United States in global affairs. We've had our disagreements, of course, but I've always believed that these are not irreconcilable differences, and that our two countries share a strong foundation of friendship and trust.\n\nAs for whether I bear any responsibility for this drift, I'd say that I'm proud of the leadership I provided after 9/11, and I believe that the decisions I made were necessary to protect our nation and stop the spread of terrorism. I've always believed that you can't please everyone, and that there will be disagreement on big issues.\n\nHowever, I do think that my successor, President Obama, took us in a different direction on these issues, and some of his decisions were widely unpopular with the Canadian people. His decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq, and not negotiating a Status of Forces Agreement with Canada was met with some frustration in Canada and the American public, particularly by its supporters who believed that these efforts weren't aligning with their vision.\n\nToday we have the Biden administration, and I think this too, has led to a further split. Again, I think that is the way it has been and remains with any leader of any nation, and I do not worry too much about this drift."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, Nick.  Well, I appreciate the question.  Let me start with Africa.  I believe that the phrase \"make poverty history\" is a compelling and powerful vision.  You know, I've had the opportunity to meet with heads of state, visit various nations, and I am convinced that there are those around the world who share this vision and believe that together we can make a difference.\n\nI think it's a goal worth striving for, and we've taken steps here in the United States to improve conditions in Africa.  We've increased our aid to Africa, and we're working with international partners to establish African countries as full-fledged partners in trade and commerce.\n\nBut as for whether it can be accomplished this year, I think it's an optimistic goal, but I believe we can make significant progress towards making poverty history.  And I believe that my administration has done its part, and we'll continue to do our part to make that goal a reality.\n\nRegarding climate change, I do believe that human industrial activity contributes to climate change, although the extent of that contribution is still a topic of debate.  I think that's an area where science needs to continue to be advanced, and I welcome further research in this area.\n\nNow, again, the U.S. is a leader in doing our part on this issue.  We've increased our funding on climate change-related research, and we've also implemented policies within our own country to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nHowever, I must say that I do have some concerns about the Kyoto Protocol.  It was negotiated without the participation of two of the biggest polluters, India and China.  And in its current form, I don't believe the Kyoto agreement is the right answer.  We can do, though, what we can do within our own country and with international partners.\n\nPolitically, I've got concerns about how economic and social trends developed in other countries can effect policies and the impact on American jobs."

The loss of life in Baghdad yesterday was a stark reminder of the difficulties we face in this global struggle against terrorism. We're makin' progress, don't get me wrong, but progress is hard to see sometimes when we're under attack and our men and women in uniform are in harm's way.\n\nNow, I know that the American people are gonna be eager to see results, and I don't fault them one bit for bein' disappointed. We asked the American people to come together behind this mission when we went into Iraq, 'cause we had to deal with Saddam Hussein, who was a threat to our very survival. I'm committed to see it through to the end, just like I'm committed to the wonderful folks back home in Cleveland who supported me in this endeavor.\n\nI want to say to the lady in Cleveland, I understand her frustration, and I appreciate her candor. We're gonna keep doin' what we're doin', and that's to hunt down the terrorists, and to bring order and stability to Iraq, and the Iraqi people can build their own government, and have the freedom that they so abhor that they fought so hard to get."

I assured him that we take all allegations of misconduct very seriously, and we're investigating thoroughly each of these allegations.

They're also committed to ensuring accountability for any wrongdoing. And I believe that our respective nations will work closely together to strengthen the capacity - strengthening the capacity for Iraqis themselves to investigate these incidents, to prosecute the guilty, and to deliver justice.\n\n(Now to the Press) In the United States, we have established the Department of Defense's Task Force on Detainee Treatment and Torture that focuses on the accountability for those allegedly involved in Abu Ghraib and other incidents. (pausing for a moment while sternly adding) I want to assure that perpetrators will be held accountable for their actions, and I'm now focusing on administrating those involved with the perpetrators.\n\n(Firmly standing up) I want to confirm to the world that the United States is committed to promoting human rights, voiced liberty in nations, and holds itself accountable to those principles that we hold dear.

    "gen_response": "I appreciate your question and the interest in this critical issue.  Now, comprehensive immigration reform is not just a humanitarian issue, it's also an economic issue, and it's a national security issue. I mean, we're calling upon Congress to take a serious look at the immigration system. And I know there's been a lot of progress made over the years. \n\nNow, you know, the bill that's pending before the Congress is, in our judgment, a comprehensive approach. It's not just addressing the issue of 11 million undocumented workers in the United States; it's also addressing the way in which we process asylum claims; it's addressing how we deal with border security; it's addressing the question of workplace enforcement; and it's addressing this most storied debate over a pathway to citizenship for those who are already here.\n\nNow, I know there's been some opposition from both parties, which is why I've been talking to members on both sides of the aisle. And I'm optimistic that we can get this bill passed. The bill that we've proposed is not perfect, but we think it's a good starting point. \n\nAs for what happened to the Congressional bill, Congress has its own way of working. Sometimes we get involved, sometimes we don't. Now, we've had members of Congress, from both sides of the aisle, come over to the White House to discuss the border fence, and some are providing helpful ideas. At the same time, we know some issues are contentious. We'll just have to work through them together.\n\nAs far as working together goes, I think we've got some momentum going on. We'll just keep working at this and push forward aggressively to find a resolution. To push forward with steps, like looking into the \"Secure America and Orderly Immigration\" initiative. To achieve this goal, this bill must pass and function with maximum efficiency - creating fairinner-working immigrants coming forward to get on the path for citizenship."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you. Thank you for having me. \n\nFirst of all, I appreciate the question. I think it's natural, given that there are going to be big decisions that will be made regarding our war on terror, which is still an ongoing commitment. As far as a new strategy in Afghanistan, I'm confident that the next administration will approach it with a unified goal in mind \u2013 to defeat al-Qaeda and the Taliban, and to help the people of Afghanistan. There will always be differences in the approach, that's natural. \n\nAs for the current administration and our approach, we've had great success in disrupting the fabric of al-Qaeda's network. Our men and women in uniform have shown their commitment to that, as have our allies around the world. Now, on the specific details, I'm sure there will be discussions going on regarding the terms under which we'll be embedding more troops, and indeed training up the Afghan military so that they can take more of the security responsibilities off of us.\n\nRegarding Pakistan, I want to say that Pakistan has made several key steps in recent years, steps that have prevented us from targeting certain safe havens. They have also, I'd like to remind people, taken it upon themselves to conduct military operations in areas where we might not have been able to. Now, we will continue to work with the government of Pakistan, our partners to ensure that we keep our shared priorities on the sheet, that is to destroy al-Qaeda.\n\nThe comment about President-elect Obama and his security team being in Pakistan; we will continue our open dialogue to talk\u2014flow themselves. This reinforced relations between us are very, very solid and forward-looking."

    "gen_response": "Well, thank you for the question.  On the first part of your question, I believe that Fidel Castro made a decision to leave the Summit of the Americas at least a day or two before the summit even started, not because of a response to any action or a comment that I made or the U.S. Government made. I think he made a decision about his health. I think we've all expressed this week, including my Secretary of State, Colin Powell, we wish him a speedy and full recovery. But that's a matter for him and the Cuban people. \n\nSecondly, as for the relationship between Mexico and Cuba, let me tell you what Paul Wolfowitz has previously. That is because of the Mexican Government's statement made by Sec. Alarcon. \"We take note that Mexico has found itself thrust into an artificial conflict with the U.S.,\". This Note emphasized, though, that the inter American system of making decisions needs to work based on 'social norms, more of feedback from other member states, and make results rather than just imposing popular will worldwide,'"

I've spoken with Secretary Rumsfeld and other leaders at the Pentagon, and I'm confident we'll have the right number of troops in place.\n\nAs you mentioned, we're planning to extend tours for some 6,500 U.S. troops, and that's a necessary step to provide stability and security. However, I don't want to speculate exactly how many more troops will be needed, but I can tell you that we're reviewing a range of options carefully.\n\nIt's true that our first goal is to train up the Iraqi Security Forces, but these fighters are making progress, and we're committed to supporting them. I'm satisfied with the progress we've made in this regard.\n\nLet me be clear: our objective in Iraq remains the same \u2013 to free the Iraqi people from tyranny and terrorism, and to help them build a peaceful, stable, and prosperous society. We're making good progress, and I'm confident that with the right planning and resources, we'll be able to provide the necessary security for the elections next year.\n\nWe're working closely with our Iraqi counterparts, with the Iyad Allawi government, and I'm satisfied that they're committed to moving forward with the elections. And we'll continue to do our part to help make that happen. Thank you."

    "gen_response": " chancellor [yeach, I mean]  I appreciate your question, and I want to commend Secretary Leavitt for his tireless work on this issue. We take no excuses, but we also recognize that the devastating impact of Katrina and Rita on our nation's first responders, both our State folks and our local governments, showed us how important it is for us to work with our partners, and we've made significant progress in that regard.\n\nHowever, I won't sugarcoat it: the threat posed by pandemic flu poses a unique and significant challenge to our nation. A pandemic flu outbreak could overwhelm our medical, our public health system, and our first responders in ways that go beyond what they're equipped to handle.\n\n Regarding using defense assets for this purpose, we're not talking about bringing in the military to take control, but rather their unique assets. So I am concerned about this, but I'm also confident in our country's resilience and ability to respond-if we work together, and utilize all the resources at our disposal, including the capabilities of our fine military, to help with logistics, to help with planning, and to help with the deployment of medical personnel and equipment.\n\nFEMA, in the wake of Katrina and Rita, has vastly improved. Tommy Thompson and now Michael Brown, and now Mike Brown has left the situation, and Michael Brown has been replaced by, uh, Mike Brown has left. Secretary Brown has left and actually Brooks, resigned and the task has been taken over by Mike Brown's replacement Brooks, who has left and actually David Paulison has taken the job.

    "gen_response": "That's a fair question.  I understand the concern that many have about the situation in Iraq.  But let me tell you, we are not going to leave this country in worse shape than when we found it. We're making progress in the defeat of Saddam Hussein's regime and the building of a democracy there.  Now, there are those who say it's going to be a long, hard road, and they're right. But we cannot allow the fact that the road ahead is long and difficult to say that we should cut and run and abandon this effort before it's done.\n\nYou've heard me speak about this before, I've made up my mind that we'll do everything we can to train the Iraqis to take over the security of their own country. But that's a process that takes time. And as long as our military personnel are not in harm's way, we will continue to work towards that goal of building a stable democracy in Iraq. We will not put our troops in the crossfire, uh, in the middle of a sectarian war. That's not what we're there to do.\n\nAs for civil war, we will not sit idly by and allow the escalation of violence. We'll continue to work with the international community to bring pressure on those who would seek to disrupt the democratic process, to quell the violence. We'll do everything in our power to prevent a full-fledged civil war. But we will not get out of there before this mission is done.\n\nI've made the decision to send more troops to Iraq, recently. Part of that decision was to help to secure the country and to prevent a full-blown civil war. Now, I know some people are skeptical that we can do this. I'm not one of them. But I know that if we don't, then we'll regret it, and I expressed my concerns to Congress time and time again about the dangers of withdrawal."

    "gen_response": "(clears throat) Ah, thank you for the question. First, I appreciate the editor of the Associated Press for pointing out the error in that title. It's the Press Secretary standing behind me, not the Secretary General. (smiles)\n\nNow, regarding the Attorney General, as you know, I've known Alberto Gonzales for a long time. He's a good man, and a dedicated public servant. I met with him earlier today, and I believe he's still committed to the important work we're doing to protect this country. However, I also understand the concerns that have been raised about his stewardship of the Justice Department. My position has been and continues to be that Attorney General Gonzales has my faith and confidence, but I also value the trust of the American people and members of the Senate. I acknowledge that there are concerns about issues like the handling of the USA PATRIOT Act, the broader effort in a several habeas cases, and investigators being inside Department of Justice apparatus twin investigations.\n\nIf the Senate votes \"no confidence\" it may prompt another evaluation of Attorney General Albert Gonzales's future, considering that I have carefully considered the implications of his departure. This would be no easy decision for me to make, I would take into consideration the welfare of this important Department of Justice post, but the Administration must respect and continue to parliamentarily creating needs into new visions and allocating priorities gradually.\n\nRegarding the NATO situation in Afghanistan, I do share concerns regarding civilian casualties. It is, as I said before, a tough, immoral environment in a war zone, it's even true that civilian casualties rise by proximity to the reality that your surroundings norms were gentle transition was unfortunate portrayed across media for the previous years.

    "gen_response": "Well, thank you, thank you. I'm glad you brought up the topic of Iraq. Now, let's get to your question. First, I appreciate your query on the relationship between the United States and France. I believe it's fair to say we've put the differences of the past behind us, yes. We've reengaged diplomatically, that we've worked together in a variety of international forums, and I believe our relationship is much stronger today than it was four years ago.\n\nNow, with regards to Iraq, let's be clear: the decision to go into Iraq was a hard decision, one that I made based on the intelligence I received, my assessment of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein, and the lessons we learned from the aftermath of September the 11th.\n\nNow, as for a withdrawal timetable, let me say this: the status of forces agreement, as you know, requires us to leave Iraq by December 31st, '16. We need to get the Iraqis in a position to take control. We need to make sure the terrorists know the war is not over, and we'll remain committed to the mission to keep America safe.\n\nAs for assistance from France, we're open to constructive ideas, but let me be clear: our security strategy in Iraq is not going to be dictated by whether or not a particular country is involved. We'll base our decisions on the security situation, the needs of the Iraqi people, and our own national interests.\n\nAnd with regards to the domestic debate on Iraq, I understand that there's a range of opinion on that. We've had debates on strategy, where todeploy troops, and the like. As for a withdrawal timeline, as you well know the \u2013 The Iraq Study Group has put forward various options, may come out with other options, and the American people will have to decide, we're having that debate, and I'm confident that once the Iraqis take control, we can begin reducing our presence in a responsible manner."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for your question. I appreciate you bringing up the visit of President Clinton, and I agree with him that the situation in Darfur is a grave tragedy. As I looked upon the memorial here, my thoughts were with the victims of this horrific conflict.\n\nAs President, I firmly believe that America has a responsibility to act when we see genocide unfolding. We've seen it firsthand in the Balkans during the Clinton administration and here in Sudan. I think our obligation to act is not only a moral one, but also a strategic and a security interest for the United States.\n\nAs for our obligations, I would tell my successor that America must be willing to lead in these situations. We cannot sit idly by when human suffering is occurring on such a massive scale. I do wish that, in hindsight, we had more forcefully pressed the Sudanese government to stop the conflict. I believe we could have done more.\n\nAs for my successor, I would advise them to use all the tools at their disposal \u2013 diplomatic, economic, and humanitarian. We've used sanctions, we've used diplomacy, and it's up to them to decide how to deploy the military if necessary.\n\nAs for me raising the issue with President Clinton, yes, I did. I've known him for some time, and I value his counsel, although I must say that I strongly disagree with his decision on many issues, the issue of genocide is one where I believe we share a common understanding.\n\nIn my conversations with him, I urged him to use his unique position to bring attention to the crisis in Darfur and to push for international action. But I also believed that we needed to do more than just raise awareness \u2013 we needed to take real action. I reminded him that as former President, he has a platform to speak out on humanitarian issues, and I encouraged him to do so.\n\nI don't recall him asking me for a specific commitment from the United States, but I would say that our discussion had more to do with strategy than specifics."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for your question.  Let me clarify. We continue to stand by our commitment to reducing our nuclear arsenal, but we also remain committed to the development and deployment of a missile defense system. Two separate issues. The reduction in nuclear arsenal has been part of our ongoing efforts to non-proliferation and our desire to work closely with Russia on issues related to non-proliferation.\n\nThe development of our missile defense system is a critical component of our national security posture, and it's aimed at addressing threats that we identify from nations such as North Korea and Iran. I don't see these two issues as being linked in the way you may have suggested. We will continue to work with Russia and other nations on nuclear disarmament, and we will continue our efforts to develop a missile defense system to protect the American people.\n\nSo, to answer your question, we have not changed our position. We remain committed to reducing our nuclear arsenal, and we're also going to move forward with our plans for a missile defense system."

    "gen_response": "I appreciate your question, and I'll do my best to address it.\n\nFirst of all, the international community is working closely with Mr. Arafat and the Palestinian Authority to find a path forward. We've seen some good steps taken, and I'm pleased that there's a willingness on both sides to engage in a comprehensive peace process.\n\nThe bravery of the Israeli Defense Forces is admirable in the face of terror and Palestinian violence. The United States supports Israel's right to defend itself and its people from terrorist threats. However, we also believe that this needs to be balanced with the need to address the legitimate aspirations and needs of the Palestinian people.\n\nNow, I understand that there may be different perspectives on how the U.S. can get more involved. However, I can tell you that this administration has been actively involved and engaged since the very beginning of this process. We've worked closely with the international community to draft plans that recognize Israel's right to exist, that also provide for a homeland for the Palestinian people, and we're committed to doing that.\n\nWhat we need now is both sides to refrain from unilateral actions that make it harder for progress. The actions taken today, as you mentioned, are concerning and, frankly, counterproductive to peace efforts. We believe that it's essential for both sides to build confidence as we move forward, and I would hope that in the days ahead, we can see that happen.\n\nNow, I've made it clear, in the vision I outlined for a comprehensive peace, there needs to be free and fair elections, security arrangements that will address violence and terrorism, economic development for the Palestinian people, and a withdrawal by Israel from major population centers. These are the dimensions of a comprehensive peace, and we need to move forward on all of these dimensions.\n\nWe're ready to do our part, but it's a very difficult, complex, and ultimately a subjective task. And that's why I call upon Mr. Arafat and Prime Minister Sharon to move forward with maximum restraint and maximum flexibility, just as we're going to do, with all parties involved.\n\nSo, to those who would ask what it takes for the U.S. to get more involved, it takes a critical mass of partnership from key peoples involved to agree to follow through on a comprehensive peace plan that address all the dimensions I mentioned. That's a tall order, I know, but I think we're making progress, and we'll continue to do our best to help achieve peace in this region."

Our esteemed Secretary-General has a draft resolution before him, and we're working through it. \n\nFirst, let me say that we acknowledge Iraq's statement that they're willing to destroy its al-Samoud missiles.  That's a positive development, and I commend them for that action. \n\nNow, the resolution that's before us includes a call for Iraq to disarm completely, including all its ballistic missiles - not just the al-Samoud. This is crucial, because Iraq has not yet convinced the world that it has disarmed completely.\n\nSecond, I want to make it clear that our position has not changed with regard to the weapons of mass destruction - chemical, biological, and nuclear. We will not be satisfied with anything less than full compliance with UN resolutions, and we will take necessary actions to enforce those resolutions if we don't see the full cooperation we need from Iraq.\n\nNow, with regard to the shape of the resolution, we're going to work together with other UN members, and we'll strive for a resolution that includes, one, the disarmament of Iraq; two, the destruction of all ballistic missiles; and, three, a regime that's transparent about its programs for WMD.\n\nNow, I don't anticipate that we'll include an ultimatum in the resolution.  However, I do anticipate that if we don't see the actions on the ground, we'll take it to the UN Security Council.  And if that doesn't work, the President and the United States reserve the right to exercise the authority of the international community."

It was the same intelligence that the United States government had, the intelligence community, the CIA had, and the British, the Australians, to name a few. It was the same intelligence that was used by the United Nations and the UNSCOM inspectors. There was a consensus among that intelligence community that the Saddam Hussein regime had WMDs.\n\nNow, I know some folks have said it was thin, it was shaky, or that it was not up to, you know, the standards that we expect. But in a time of war, we must weigh probabilities and act on that basis. We had a situation where a dictator who had used WMDs before, that had chemical and biological agents and missiles, was about to possess nuclear capability in a very short time.\n\nAnd I made a decision to act, not on the information we had, not on the highest probabilities, but on the certainty that we had to act to protect the American people and to protect the peaceful peoples of the world from a dictator who would use those WMDs.\n\nI think it's interesting, those who question the decision to go to war in Iraq sometimes conveniently forget that, prior to that, the US had given Iraq numerous warnings, numerous opportunities to comply with UN resolutions, numerous inspections, and we had this fella who was unwilling to let inspectors in to verify whether or not these WMDs existed or not.\n\nSo, to say we went to war on flimsy evidence, I respectfully disagree. We acted on the solid foundation of credible intelligence, and we knew we had to act, and we acted to protect the world."

I guess the question implies, or your words maybe imply, I was somehow divisive. Regardless of how I put it, my concern was, is, and will always be for the security of the American people. My job as the President is to evaluate the situation, every day, the security situation, and I have to have clear goals and we have to have clear language.\n\nWe can have disagreements, but at the end of the day, my priority is to protect the American people. Now, I can see how some might say or interpret my words as putting out in a way that creates blinders on how my opponent would view this, but I was simply trying to be direct in how I could define the philosophical differences in how we are going to fight and win in this war.\n\nYou know, I, we, America is capable of-change and I believe we can change the tone, not just in Washington, but in how we approach these tough issues. My commitment to doing just that remains strong. My commitment to showing the American people that we can work together in this Congress, in this country to get big things done, remains strong.\n\nNow, my administration is prepared to cooperate fully and completely with any oversight that is necessary and legitimate. The American people have a right to know that their government is acting honorably and transparently, and we are committed to openness.\n\nWe have cooperative audit and investigation controls in place and that will continue under any particular administration.

We've been saying for a long time that progress in Iraq would be reported regularly. The September report is simply a milestone along the way to a more stable and secure Iraq. And I believe it's inconsistent with our strategy to give them a date to focus on. Instead, we're giving the enemy a clearer report card. We expect them to react in certain ways. The way they react will give us a better understanding of the type of progress that's been made and the challenges that we'll still face.\n\nAs for plan B, I think the term is a misleading one. The term \"plan B\" gives the idea that we have a second alternative, one that's uniformly good. We do have contingency plans, unplanned-for scenarios that we expect could occur. We're working on multiple scenarios, we're working on a variety of options. What we're trying to get to is a security situation where the political process can move forward. I firmly believe that our goal in Iraq is a stable and democratic Iraq, the kind of country that can be a partner in the region, a country, the kind of self-determination that our greatest allies, partners want."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for that question.  Let me start by saying that I'm quite familiar with Dmitry Medvedev. I had the opportunity to meet him when he served as the Prime Minister, and later as President of the Russian Federation. My administration maintained diplomatic relations with Russia, but at the same time, we also were tough on them on issues like missile defense and NATO expansion.\n\nNow, I think it's fair to say that Vladimir Putin still maintains significant influence over the Russian government, even though the constitution requires him to step down as President. But make no mistake, Mr. Medvedev is a formidable individual in his own right, and I believe he's a product of the KGB. He's someone who's very skilled in the ways of politics and has done a good job in advancing Russia's interests.\n\nIn terms of power dynamics, it's clear that Vladimir Putin still pulls the strings, particularly on issues related to national security and foreign policy. However, I do believe that Medvedev has managed to carve out some room for himself to operate in areas like economic policy and domestic issues.\n\nSo, my cautionary tale to my successor would be to be firmly resolute in our commitment to defending our interests and those of our allies, particularly in Europe and in the Newly Independent States. Russia must still be held accountable for its actions in places like Chechnya and Georgia.\n\nAnd as for how to deal with Medvedev, I would urge my successor to maintain a strong, bipartisan approach towards Russia. We should engage in dialogue, but we must also be willing to stand up to them when they overstep their bounds. It's a delicate balance, but one that's essential to maintaining global stability.\n\nAnd as for Putin, I've always said that he's a ruthless bully who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. I strongly disagreed with many of his policies, and I'm concerned about the trampling of human rights and democratic institutions in Russia.\n\nYou know, we've seen the emergence of autocracies in several parts of the world, and it's more important than ever that America stands firmly for the values of freedom, democracy, and liberty. We must stand strong, unwavering in our commitment to our allies and our values.\n\nSo, that's my two cents on Russia and the dilemma we face as a nation. I'm confident that my successor will be guided by a deep understanding of the challenge and the opportunity that Russia presents."

We're not interested in an open-ended conflict, but we firmly believe that it is necessary to take action to disarm Saddam Hussein and bring stability to the region.\n\nWe've been very specific in our intentions, using diplomacy, using the United Nations, and using the weakest possible military option, but Saddam has ignored that, that's why we're talking about force.  Now, I know the Chancellor shares many of the concerns we have about Iraq.  We're talking to our friends in Europe, we're talking to our friends in the United Nations, we're gathering the coalition, and I'm confident that we'll get the job done.\n\nNow, let me address your second point.  Germany has been a very valued ally in this war on terror, and I'm greatly appreciative of the critical role they played in Afghanistan, the deployment of our troops in the stabilization effort, and the various measures they've taken to help the Muslim world find ways to reconcile with democracy and freedom.

We believe it's time to update our relationship with Russia, to reflect the realities of the 21st century.\n\nWe're working with the Congress to pass a new framework for our relationship with Russia, which includes the possible repeal of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. This would be an important step forward in our relationship with Russia, and we believe it would help promote the values of free and fair trade.\n\nAs for the WTO, Russia is working actively to gain membership, and we believe that accession would improve economic ties between the United States and Russia and benefit trade opportunities for businesses in both countries. We're committed to working with Russia to facilitate its accession to the WTO and promoting the benefits of free trade.\n\nAnd as for Boeing and Russian civil aviation, we believe that the increased demand for air travel in Russia presents a huge opportunity for U.S. companies like Boeing, particularly in the fields of commercial aircraft and services. We've had productive discussions with the Russian government and with Boeing officials about the potential for partnerships and business deals.\n\nIn fact, just this past year, we had the signing of a joint U.S.-Russia agreement on cooperation in the field of peaceful use of outer space, in which U.S. businesses can participate. We'll also consider other areas of possible partnership such as intelligence sharing, non-proliferation and energy cooperation.\n\nAs I said this morning, Mr. Putin and I spoke on the phone about cooperation on terrorism, be it Islamic terrorism or other form of it, as examples.

We need to act now to ensure that the future of this vital region is not controlled by those who harbor terrorists and would do us harm.\n\nThe debt, as I said, cannot be saddled on the Iraqi people. They have suffered for far too long. They deserve a chance at building a prosperous future, free from the grip of Saddam Hussein. Our goal is to give them a chance to govern themselves and become a stable, secure ally in the region.\n\nNow, I know some of my critics will say that we should should have planned for this earlier, and I agree that prudence is a virtue. But let me tell you, no one could have anticipated the magnitude of the task we'd be faced with when freeing the Iraqi people. We've done the best we can with the information we had at the time.\n\nI still believe that this investment in Iraq is a crucial one for our national security, and that it's a necessary burden for us to bear. And I'm confident that when the history books are written, Americans will see that this investment was worth it. We will continue to work with Congress to ensure that we're doing everything we can to minimize the burden on taxpayers and to ensure that our efforts are focused on securing the long-term stability and prosperity of the people of Iraq."

We've had several operations, several efforts to root out al-Zarqawi, but I'm not going to get into specific details about our operations.  I will tell you, though, that we're committed to that goal.\n\nAs for General Abizaid's statement, I agree with him that we need to maintain flexibility in all our operations. I also agree with his assessment that we're not yet where we need to be. However, I want to remind everyone that we have 135,000 troops in Iraq right now. Those troops are doing a fine job.  We are redeploying troops into the theater.  We're prioritizing our forces.  We've surged forces into Iraq from Army, Navy, and Air Force, and we'll continue to analyze if more troops are needed.\n\nWe cannot let no one crush the democratization of Iraq, nor the establishment of a free society in that country. Iraq has fundamental significance to our long term goals, regional issues like Iran, Syria, and your long-term strategic objectives. But we also must ensure that we protect America from those who seek to hurt us. We all know President Bush wants to bring American home quickly as possible, but I will remind the country that improving security means retreating is not in the question.\n\nAs Pledge to the Iraqi people, we're working closely with Prime Minister Maliki, and his government to establish an Iraqi-based solution to these conflagrations. In Baghdad, our people are working on maintaining order and training an army. Its simply this: no matter what our job is, we cannot abandon it at the first sight of hardship."

I do indeed believe that Senator Kerry's mixed messages on Iraq are causing confusion among our allies, and more importantly, among the Iraqi people.

It's like the old saying goes: \"Actions speak louder than words.\" When Senator Kerry says one thing in public and then contradicts himself in private, it's confusing, not just to the American people, but to the Iraqis, who are struggling to establish a government and a new society.\n\nAnd regarding the impact on our efforts in Iraq, I think it's clear that if we're clear about our commitment to success in Iraq, then the enemy can plan accordingly, and the Iraqis will understand that we mean business.

On Social Security, I think we've put forth some common-sense solutions. We've increased the FICA tax by 2% on high-income workers, expanded the 'Windfall Profits Tax,' and we've directed money into the trust fund that will back the program.\n\nAs for the economy, we've had some dislocations caused by 9/11 and the recession, but I think we're making great progress.

We're asking a lot from these folks, and I want to assure the American people that I appreciate the service and sacrifice of every single one of them.\n\nAs for the concerns about morale... I wouldn't say it's a surprise to me. I've been warned about the wear and tear of multiple tours, the lack of time at home, and the uncertainty about the mission. I've spoken to many of our commanders and troops on the ground, and they've expressed similar concerns.\n\nIt's not a minority opinion, it's a reality we have to face. But I can tell you, it's not widespread. The vast majority of our troops remain committed to their mission and to the cause. They know what they're fighting for, and they're proud of what they're doing.\n\nAs for the question of whether it's growing, I would say it's a trend we're watching carefully. I've ordered the Pentagon to take a hard look at the issue of troop rotation, to make sure that our troops have enough time to prepare, train, and be with their families before we ask them to deploy again.\n\nIt does concern me, of course. It concerns me because we're a volunteer military, and we can't ask people to do this job without a steady, clear purpose and without making sure they have the support they need.

The Iraqi people know it's working, we know it's working, and the violence has decreased dramatically. It's a testament to our brave men and women in uniform, and the bravery of the Iraqi Security Forces. I'm not sure how anyone can walk through the streets of Basra today and Baghdad today and not see what we've accomplished in a short period of time.\n\nRegarding the benchmarks, I believe the Iraqi people overwhelmingly support a unified government. But it's up to their leaders to act on that.\n\nThe one benchmark that I think would have a profound impact is an agreement between the Maliki government and the Iraqi Kurdish leaders. You've seen the progress that's been made by the Kurds in their own region. I believe if Maliki and the Kurds could come together and create a national plan for oil revenue sharing and representation in government, that would be a big step forward.\n\nNext, I believe the Iraqi government should take action to repeal the de-Baathification law, and bring back into the Iraqi Security Forces individuals who have served this nation in the past. Many of these brave men and women who had served under Saddam have dedicated their lives to security and stability in their country.\n\nAnd finally, I would encourage the Iraqi government to make significant strides on reconciliation and national reconciliation. And that's going to take leadership within the government, and that's going to take leadership across religious lines.\n\nNow, I know it won't be easy. But I also know that the people of Iraq are yearning for stability and peace, and I believe that if their leaders take these steps and others, it's possible for Iraq to be a functioning democracy that's at peace."

We've made it clear that we cannot accept that. I've made it clear, my administration has made it clear that all options are on the table.\n\nIn the event that Iran rejects this proposal, or worse yet does not comply with it, we would be prepared to work with our international partners to implement additional measures, including economic sanctions. We'd work with the United Nations Security Council to impose those sanctions.\n\nWith respect to specific measures, I think it's premature to say exactly what they'll be, because we want to give Iran a chance to show its seriousness about addressing the concerns. We'll work closely with Chancellor Merkel and our European partners to assess the situation, and to determine the best course of action.\n\nBut I can tell you, those sanctions would be targeted to compel Iran to change course, and to comply with its international obligations. We expect Iran to take this proposal seriously, and to use it as an opportunity to avoid the path of confrontation. The clock is ticking, and we're watching closely to see what they choose to do.\n\nThe Chancellor and I have been in close consultation, and I believe we're on the same page.

We believed that President Saddam Hussein had stockpiled these weapons, and we believed that removing him would make the world safer.\n\nRegarding postwar planning in Iraq, I'll admit that there were some challenges and we could have done some things differently. We underestimated the insurgency and the sectarian divisions that would arise in the wake of Saddam's removal. That said, I believe that our goal of liberating the Iraqi people and bringing democracy to that country has ultimately been a successful one.\n\nAnd as to 9/11, of course, the intelligence failure in this regard is a critical one. We didn't have the benefit of knowing that al-Qaeda was planning an attack of this magnitude. However, I believe it's unfair to lay at my doorstep the blame for not preventing the attacks. The 9/11 Commission, for example, identified some failures at the intelligence agencies, but also acknowledged that these failures predated my administration.\n\nYou know, I'm not one to dwell on mistakes.

However, as I reflected on those ideas and considered the complexities of the world, I realized that promoting democracy and liberty is not just a byproduct of good foreign policy, but a vital component of it.\n\nMy conversation with Dick Cheney, and with frankly, the experience of responding to the attacks of 9/11, showed me that our nation's security is fundamentally tied to the spread of freedom, not just in the physical sense but also as a moral and ideological force.\n\nAs I gazed into the eyes of the families of those lost on September 11th, I saw individuals who were forever changed by the ideology of hatred. And I realized that we have to confront that ideology with the robust and consistent application of our values.\n\nWhen you look at Saddam Hussein and the tyranny that existed in Iraq, and you look at the countless people who suffered under his rule, you come to understand that the absence of freedom is not just a bad thing for the people who are oppressed \u2013 it ultimately becomes a problem for our own nation's safety.\n\nWe've learned that you can't isolate that threat from our shores. If we don't take an active role in promoting freedom and democracy \u2013 if we don't lead by example and stand with those who seek it \u2013 then we inadvertently create a power vacuum that more likely invites tyranny and chaos to spread.\n\nMy commitment to promoting democracy and liberty has deepened as President. I believe it's essential for the long-term security, stability, and prosperity of the United States and the world. We will work tirelessly to help nations in need, from the struggling democracies in the Balkans to those yearning for the freedom of the Middle East.\n\nI trust that by taking a deliberate, forceful, and principled approach to this challenge, we will make progress toward the vision of a peaceful and free world that truly reflects our American values and will serve as a beacon of hope for generations to come."

The resolution that was passed by the Senate doesn't necessarily represent a split within the party, I think it's a sign of good faith on the part of the Senate to insist that the administration provide greater clarity and information to them about our strategy in Iraq. And I appreciate the constructive criticism from my Congress. We're a representative democracy, and it's the right way for the elected representatives of the people to have a debate.\n\nNow, as for whether it's embarrassing, I don't think so. I think it's part of the process. And I'm confident that our mission in Iraq is on the right track. I'm confident that the Iraqi people are moving towards stability and self-governance. We'll continue to work closely with Congress to provide the information they need, and I'm confident that we'll be able to get the support we need to complete our mission.\n\nI will say I've had good discussions with members of the Republican caucus \u2013 they've expressed their support for our strategy, for the troops, and for our objectives. I'm confident that we can work through these differences and come up with a unified approach.\n\nAnd let me also say, in terms of traveling abroad, this is a natural part of being the President of the United States. It's my duty to represent our country, and to meet with leaders from around the world to advance our national interests. And I'm not deterred by any differences within the party back home. We'll continue to work together in a bipartisan way to get the job done.\n\nAnd I want to make it clear to you all and the American people, that the decision we make on Iraq will be based on our national security interests, not based on politics.

Let me first say, Toomas Ilves and I have indeed discussed our mutual concerns regarding the situation in Georgia, and I want to thank him for his leadership on this issue.\n\nAs for resolving the conflict between Russia and Georgia, it is in all our interests to find a peaceful and lasting solution to this conflict. We urge both countries to end all violence and to respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nThe United States has been a strong supporter of Georgia's efforts to build democracy and prosperity, and it's indeed regrettable that the current situation has set back that progress. We welcome the efforts of our European partners and other international organizations working to facilitate a resolution to this conflict.\n\nWe continue to support the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia, consistent with the principles of the Moscow Ceasefire Agreement and UN Security Council Resolutions. And we will continue to work with the international community to encourage a peaceful and lasting resolution.\n\nI'd like to especially commend our NATO partner, Mr. Ilves, for Estonia's role in supporting democracy and stability in Georgia. We appreciate Estonia's strong commitment to our shared values of democracy and freedom.\n\nUltimately, our goal is a Georgia that is stable, secure, and a strong partner in the region.

They want us to prevail. \n\nNow, I'm not a Pollyanna, but I'm optimistic about our chances for success in Iraq.  I firmly believe that our goals are worthwhile, that a free Iraq is a key to a more secure America, that we can succeed by training a secure Iraqi military, and that the work we're doing is building a safer, stable, and more prosperous region in the Middle East.\n\nThe will of the American people can be expressed through their elected representatives.

Now, I understand that we won't agree on everything, and we won't always see eye-to-eye, but that's okay. In fact, it's healthy in a democracy.\n\nI'd say this past year, we've had our share of, shall we say, spirited disagreements on issues like energy policy, tax relief, and the war on terror, but we've also made progress on some fronts, like border security and mining some common ground on education reform.\n\nNow, have I always been successful in working with Democrats?  I think I have been. I think we've had some good sessions with Speaker Pelosi, and, of course, with our leaders like Sen. Reid. I've tried to remember, in my advice to our party, that \"compassionate conservatism\" means being willing to work with others, even if we don't always agree.\n\nYou know, when I was in Texas, I remember my dad, George H.W. Bush, would say, \"Go big, go bold, but also be willing to compromise.\" He's right, absolutely right. And that's exactly what I've tried to do.\n\nNow, I know this administration's faced some tough choices, and we won't get everything we want from the other side, and I always want to be clear about that.

The significance of this vote is a testament to the Venezuelan people's desire to determine their own destiny and reject the sort of authoritarianism that President Chavez has embodied.\n\nAlthough Hugo Chavez has been a critic of my administration, we recognize that the Venezuelan people's decision speaks to a clear desire for democratic government, and I'm heartened by that. Our policy is to stand with the people of Venezuela, who are facing challenges in terms of the economy, in terms of their security concerns, and basically in their struggle for democracy and freedom.\n\nMr. Chavez obviously has had a complicated relationship with my administration, and I'm not surprised that he might view this result as a loss. The idea of him calling me the devil is, you know, hardly the first time I've been called that, and I couldn't let it distract me from my duties.\n\nIn any case, I think this vote shows the Venezuelan people are clear about what they want: democracy, prosperity, and the rule of law. As we continue to engage in the region, we'll be working closely with our friends in Venezuela to help facilitate a peaceful transition to a government that represents the will of the Venezuelan people.\n\nI want to emphasize, though, that our relationship with Venezuela is focused on the Venezuelan people, not on any one individual. We'll be looking at ways to deepen our relationships with the Venezuelan people, to support their economy, and to promote the kinds of democratic principles that have been endorsed by this vote."

The Vice President has also disclosed all the necessary information regarding his time at Halliburton. It's a matter of personal information, and I don't think it's fair to drag the Vice President into some sort of politicized interrogation.\n\nWe're a country founded on the principles of fairness and due process, and I'm willing to abide by those principles.

I've been briefed thoroughly on Chairman Roberts' proposal and I appreciate his dedication to making sure our intelligence agencies are able to serve this nation effectively.\n\nAs you know, I appointed the 9/11 Commission to review the intelligence failures that led to the attacks on our country. One of the Commission's key recommendations was to streamline and reform our intelligence community. And I believe Chairman Roberts' proposal is a bold step in that direction.\n\nNow, the White House is carefully reviewing the proposal, and we're working closely with the Congress and the intelligence community to ensure that any reforms are thorough, effective, and aligned with the Commission's recommendations.\n\nRegarding giving the National Intelligence Director significant budgetary authority, I believe that's a good idea. Consolidating decision-making and giving the NID a strong hand in budgetary matters could help eliminate waste, increase efficiency, and provide better strategic vision for our intelligence efforts.\n\nHowever, there are questions about the proposal's potential impact on the military's ability to gather intelligence on the battlefield. Any reorganization must ensure our military continues to have the resources it needs to carry out its crucial intelligence missions.\n\nSo, the short answer is, we're carefully considering Chairman Roberts' proposal, and we're working with the intelligence community to make improvements that support our national security and our efforts in the war on terrorism.\n\nThank you, that's all I have to say on that for now. I'll continue to be engaged in this process and work towards a reform that makes our intelligence community the best it can be."

(pauses) I believe the key to securing this city and the entire country is to have the Iraqi people and their military take ownership of their security. The coalition's presence has been unsupportive, but not decisive. Now it is the Iraqis who must stand and fight for their freedom, and it's imperative that we continue to train and mentor their troops to do just that.\n\nTo answer your question directly, there's no magic bullet, no single policy change that would suddenly and instantly rectify the situation. It will require sustained effort by the government of Iraq and our coalition partners. We must also continue to seek out and eliminate the terrorist forces that are sowing terror and division in Iraq.\n\nThe past few weeks have shown us that it's possible, with a united effort, we can make strides in the fight against extremists. I've met with leaders from the govern-ment, and they're committed to a wide-ranging reform agenda that will tackle corruption, eliminate bias, and bring order and stability to the country."

And we must deal with it as such. But, let me tell you, it's more than just a crime.  It's a threat to our very way of life. And that's why we've been so aggressive in pursuing a comprehensive strategy against these -- against terrorism.\n\nNow, in terms of the, uh, difference in views between myself and Senator Kerry in 2004, I think it's safe to say that we had significant differences. Senator Kerry, who's a fine fellow, felt that you could negotiate with these -- these radical Islamic extremists, that you could talk to them, and they would -- they would -- reason with. I disagreed. I felt we had to show the world we were resolute, that we would take actions to protect the American people.\n\nAnd I think our actions speak louder than words. We've been unilaterally, if you will -- unilaterally speaking -- taking out the terrorist leadership, dismantling their networks, and ridding the world of a threat. And I think that approach was asymmetrical to Senator Kerry's view. But, again, I respect his views, even if we disagreed.\n\nNow, in terms of the distinction between Tony Blair and me, well, Tony's a close partner.  We share a deep commitment to democracy, to human rights, and to freedom. But I think we also bring different perspectives. Tony's, uh, experience in Northern Ireland, and my own experience dealing with Bin Laden and Saddam, I think give us a -- a unique understanding. And I think our combined views will help guide our foreign policy, especially with regard to the war on terror."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you, folks. I appreciate that question. (pauses) First, I want to assure the American people that we're closely monitoring the situation with the housing market and the impact it's having on the broader economy. We understand the concerns that many families are facing, and we're working hard to address them.\n\nRegarding your question about housing prices, I think it's clear that the housing market has experienced a significant correction. I don't think it's a surprise to anyone that housing prices have come down in many parts of the country. The question is, when will the market bottom out? I'm not a economist, but I can tell you that our economic team is working hard to analyze the data and provide guidance to the Fed.\n\nAs for the availability of credit, you're right that it's become more difficult for people to borrow money. That's a concern because it can make it harder for families to finance purchases, which can have cascading effects on the economy. However, I want to be clear that the federal government's role is not to step in and become the lender of last resort. We need to work through this and find market-driven solutions.\n\nNow, regarding government action, I do believe that we need to take steps to address the fallout from the housing crisis. I've already signed legislation that provides relief to homeowners who are struggling to stay on top of their mortgages. We're working with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to help stabilize the secondary mortgage market. And we're looking at other options to stabilize the housing market, including incentives for buyers and sellers, and assistance for homeowners facing foreclosure.\n\nNow, on the question of a government bailout, I want to be careful. The American people sent us to Washington to make tough choices and not to spend their money on bailouts. However, I do believe that there are some steps we can take to support families who are struggling through no fault of their own. For example, we're exploring ways to modify subprime mortgages to make them more affordable. We're also looking at programs to assist families who are in danger of losing their homes, such as the Hope for Homeowners program we announced last year.\n\nSo, to answer your question specifically, while we're not planning a large-scale bailout, we are taking targeted steps to help families and stabilize the housing market. And we'll continue to work with economists, with Congressional leaders, and with the Fed to find the right balance between supporting the economy and not overreaching with government intervention.\n\n(pausing) And I want to assure the American people that we're committed to protecting the stability of the financial system and the economy, but we're also committed to doing so in a way that's fiscally responsible and true to our conservative principles."

They've been courageous, they've been dedicated, and they've worked closely with us to build a more secure and free Afghanistan.\n\nOf course, our view, as the NATO commander, General McNeill, has said that security conditions in Afghanistan remain challenge - ing.

As I said, our military mission in Iraq is to defend our country, to defeat terrorism, and to help the Iraqis stand on their own two feet. We have made great progress, and I believe that we are in a position to eventually transition the security of Iraq to Iraqi forces, and then reduce our military presence over time. That doesn't mean there won't be risks, but it also doesn't mean there won't be challenges ahead. But I still believe it's an achievable goal.\n\nAs for the term \"endless war\" or \"open-ended war,\" I think that's a mislabeling. We'll continue to review and adjust our tactics and strategies to ensure the success of our mission. I believe our resolve is unwavering, but I also believe our military is the best in the world, and they'll continue to execute a successful strategy.\n\nAs for your question about the meeting I had with the three presidential candidates, I must remind you that as the former President, I'm neutral and not taking sides. I met with each of them to discuss various issues, including our relationship with Europe and the transatlantic alliance. I was pleased to hear their thoughts on the matter. While I didn't feel a \"kinship\" with any one of them, I do believe that all three share a deep commitment to the transatlantic relationship and the values that we've worked so hard to maintain.\n\nAs for the future of the transatlantic relationship, I'm confident that it'll continue to grow stronger. The partnership between the United States and our European allies has been a cornerstone of international diplomacy for decades, and I believe it's essential to our shared security, our economic prosperity, and our commitment to freedom and human rights. I'm optimistic that the next President will continue to strengthen this relationship, just as I've tried to do during my time in office, and just as my father did before me."

I appreciate the question, and I'm happy to share with you our thoughts on the Middle East conference and the situation in Iraq.\n\nFirst and foremost, we believe in the importance of a Middle East peace conference. We've discussed this extensively with our partners, particularly the French government, and we share their commitment to find a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We believe that a conference could provide an opportunity for all parties to come together and work towards a two-state solution, which we believe is the only lasting solution to the conflict.\n\nAs for the timing, we've been working with the parties to try to bring the conference together as soon as possible. We're hoping to make it happen in the near future, but we need to be realistic. The parties need to be ready, and we need to make sure that we have a solid foundation for successful negotiations.\n\nAs for President Arafat, we've had our differences with him in the past, but we still believe that he should be included in the conference. However, we also believe that the Palestinian people deserve a more stable and effective leadership, and we're working with the Palestinian Authority to support reforms and improvements in governance.\n\nNow, regarding Iraq, let me be clear: we are committed to the regime change in Iraq. We believe that Saddam Hussein's regime poses a threat to the region and to our interests, and we will not tolerate that. We've made progress in building a coalition to address this threat, and we're working with our partners in the Arab states and the United Nations to build a consensus for action.\n\nOur plan is to give Saddam Hussein a chance to comply with the United Nations' resolutions and disarm his weapons of mass destruction. We're working with the United Nations team in Iraq to monitor the situation, and we're seeking a final resolution from the UN Security Council to take action if necessary.\n\nThe Iraqi regime will have a choice to make: comply with the resolutions, or face the consequences. We're giving them every opportunity to comply, but we're also making it clear that we will not allow them to use WMDs or threaten their neighbors. The region will be safer, and the world will be safer, when Saddam Hussein is no longer in power.\n\nI want to emphasize that our priority is to diffuse the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's regime, not to attack or destabilize the region. We're working with our partners to build a coalition to support post-Saddam Iraq, because we believe that a new government, responsive to the will of the Iraqi people, will be a more stable and more cooperative partner in the region.\n\nThank you, and I'm happy to take more questions."

As you know, we've taken significant steps since 9/11 to reorganize the government's efforts to combat terrorism. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security and the emphasis on counterintelligence are necessary steps to protect the American people.\n\nRegarding the suggestion from the FBI that combining law enforcement and counterterrorism might hinder their effectiveness, I understand their concerns. I also understand the importance of sharing intelligence and working together to prevent threats. However, we must keep in mind that these two roles are distinct and crucial to the overall safety of the American people.\n\nTo build on the progress made, the intelligence reforms we're proposing will enhance our ability to gather, analyze, and share information. We're streamlining the process, cutting bureaucratic red tape, and ensuring that our agencies have the resources they need to do their jobs. \n\nNow, I agree with critics that real leadership from the White House is necessary to see this reform through successfully. So here's how I plan to take the lead: I've instructed the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Attorney General to be part of a task force to review and implement these changes. This task force will ensure we don't rush into structural changes that could hinder our current efforts. Careful, thoughtful reforms will allow us to take the next step in making America safer, just as we did after 9/11.\n\nWe must strike a balance between ensuring our agencies have the resources they need and deal with redundant bureaucratic complications. So far, I'm confident that these systemic changes, while important, must be done with the American people in mind, protecting them from the growing threats we face. \n\nIn short, we're not eliminating any sacrifice of effective policies and all agencies' efficiency that fail to make those who advise me and serve me informed and our desk delight though."

I remember my first meeting with Vladimir Putin, and, as I said, I think I did indeed get a sense of who he is, a strong man, a determined leader. And I've gotta tell you, his words and actions since then have been, in many respects, troubling.\n\nHis willingness to provide conventional and, in the case of the nuclear components to Iran, potentially catastrophic technology to regimes we've deemed undemocratic, it raises concerns for me about his own commitment to stability and peace in this region. Now, as I said, I've said this before and I'll say it again, the United States will continue to work with Russia on areas of shared interest, like counter-terrorism efforts and energy security. But when it comes to Iran and Syria, we can't just be silent or simply interventions from afar. We have a responsibility to engage these nations in a way that promotes our core values of freedom, of human rights, and of self-determination.\n\nAnd so, what I'll be looking for in the next meeting with Mr. Putin is a clear commitment from him, to demonstrate that his words will be matched by actions that strengthen our shared goals for peace and stability, especially for the people of the Middle East. And I expect the American people to know that I will not shy away from forcefully communicating that our values and our interests not be disregarded by powers seeking to undermine regional security.\n\n(latly looks at the press corps) You know, this is a critical moment for the United States to reassert our leadership and our values on the world stage.

That being said, I'm the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, and the safety and security of the people in this vicinity, including my family, is my primary concern.\n\nWhile I trust the folks who set up these protocols, I do think it would have been a good idea for me to be informed that a military operation was taking place over the White House. However, I'm also confident that the men and women who work in the Secret Service and the military did their jobs and responded quickly and professionally to the situation.\n\nNow, as for the protocols, I think we'll have to take a hard look at them and see if there is any way we can improve them, so that in the future, the President is informed in a timely manner. However, I want to make it clear that my priority, and the priority of my staff, is always going to be the safety and security of the American people and those of us who work here in the White House.

    "gen_response": "I appreciate the question, and I'll do my best to give you a straightforward answer. When it comes to training and equipping the Iraqi military, we're making significant progress. I mean, we're talking about an entirely new military, a brand new military, and it's taken time. It's not an easy task.\n\nNow, I understand the question of why we haven't seen a decrease in U.S. and coalition forces yet. Well, the reason is that we're still facing a tough enemy in the Iraq insurgency. We've still got al-Qaeda in Iraq operating, and they're still trying to destabilize the country.\n\nSo, we've got to continue to have a robust and strong military presence in Iraq to ensure that we can help the Iraqi people, help the Iraqi military, and help them develop into a force that can take care of themselves. That's why you're still seeing a significant number of American and coalition forces on the ground.\n\nNow, as for a draw-down, I think it's fair to say that we're working towards that goal. We're working towards a point in time where the Iraqis will be more capable of taking care of their own country, and we'll be able to start scaling back our presence.\n\nBut let me tell you, it's a process that's going to take time, it's going to take patience, and it's going to take a lot of hard work. We're not going to set an artificial timeline, because the timeline has to be based on conditions on the ground. And I think we're making progress, but we're not there yet.\n\nSo, we'll continue to work towards that goal, and we'll let the American people know when that's a reasonable and safe time to start scaling back our forces. But until then, we're going to keep working with the Iraqi military to build their capacity, to help them become stronger, and to help them become more independent."

I think it's fair to say that staff changes are a normal part of governance, they're a normal part of government service, especially at this level.\n\nGeneral Pace's decision to step down was his decision. I had a lot of conversations with him, and I think he felt that it was time for him to go. And we certainly respect that. Secretary Gates and I, we're comfortable with General Moseley taking over as the new Chairman, and we're supportive of that.\n\nAs for what this says about the politics of Washington, I think it's fair to say that we're dealing with a lot of changes, big wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we've got a national security environment that's volatile. But I'm proud to say that the communication between the Pentagon and the Hill has been good, it's been steady, and we're working through our differences.\n\nNow, let me be plain, we all know thatdecorating top Generals in times of war is a serious business. We're talking about lives, we're talking about the security of the American people, and we've got to make decisions that will serve that purpose, not to get bogged down in Washington politics. So yeah, I think we've made a decision that will serve the country well.\n\nAgain, General Pace has been a fine Chairman, and we appreciate his service. We wish him well, and we're looking forward to working with General Moseley."

    "gen_response": "Good question.  I've been aware of this situation, and I've been briefed on it.  The Abdul-Mahdi al-Sadr government in Iraq has concerns about the legitimacy of this oil deal between Hunt Oil and the Kurdish Regional Government, and I understand those concerns.\n\nLet me be clear: we want the governing authorities in Baghdad to have a central role in determining how to best manage the oil resources of the country.  But as the Iraqi people begin to exercise their new sovereignty,  we also need to be open to various regional authorities making decisions on exploiting their own resources.  However, we need constructive dialogue to be maintained between all parties to definitely establish a national approach on the oil issue.\n\nThat being said, while the federal government in Baghdad may have reasons for concern, we will continue to encourage lawful development of Iraq's hydrocarbons resources, in line with the ambitions they laid out in their constitution.\n\nThe real point though, is that our intent has remained all along to support the Iraqi people to reach a comprehensive oil-sharing plan to be a component of a more effective national unity."

    "gen_response": "Paul, thanks for the question. First, let me say that I appreciate the professionalism and the cooperation that we've had with the Australian military and the Australian people in this conflict. The deployment of 2,000 Australian troops has been a vital part of our security efforts in the region.\n\nNow, when it comes to the concept of withdrawal versus pullback, the distinction is critical. You see, the Australian plan does not amount to a withdrawal from Iraq, but rather a pullback of Australian forces from the combat regions to a safer location. They are still going to maintain a significant military presence in the country and are continuing to contribute to our efforts to stabilize Iraq.\n\nI wouldn't say that this decision is a withdrawal, Paul. It's a tactical redeployment that's designed to protect the lives of Aussie soldiers, which I think is a noble effort. You know, I was the one who made the tough decision to surge in Iraq, which was the right decision, and I think this is another example of the complexities of making those decisions.\n\nAnd as for Kevin Rudd \u2013 I think the Australians would be proud of him. I think he's a man of conviction, Paul. He made a decision based on what's best for Australia's interests, and that's what leaders do. I respect that leadership. I think, you know, I'd been getting a little concerned about the tone of the Australian discussion on Iraq. This decision puts some people at ease, I'm glad he's made it, and I look forward to working with him on this new chapter in our military partnership in the region."

In fact, I'm more convinced than ever that it's achievable. It's going to require determination, it's going to require leadership from both sides, but I believe Mr. Olmert has shown a commitment to peace, and I appreciate his efforts.\n\nNow, with regard to the settlements, I've made it clear to the Israelis that under the Roadmap for Peace, those settlements must stop, and I expect that. The settlements are an obstacle to peace, and I'm not reluctant to say that. But I also want to make it clear that I understand that the Israeli people have concerns about their security, and I've made commitments to them to ensure that those concerns are addressed.\n\nNow, I'm not naive about the challenges we face. I know it's tough, I know it's complex, but I also know that it's worth it. I believe that the people of Israel and the people of Palestine deserve a chance to live in peace, free from the cycle of violence.\n\nSo, I'm gonna keep working towards that goal, and I'm confident that it's achievable. I'm not gonna give up on it. I'm gonna keep pushing, and I'm gonna keep leading. And I'm gonna work closely with the international community, with Congress, and with my partners in the Middle East to make sure that we achieve this goal.\n\nIn fact, I've told the Israeli and Palestinian leaders that I'm committed to helping them achieve a peace agreement by the end of the year. And I'm serious about that. I'm gonna keep pushing for every opportunity that presents itself, and I'm gonna work tirelessly towards that effort.\n\nNow, I know there are folks who say it can't be done, and I understand that skepticism. But I've never been one to believe that the impossible is impossible. I've always believed that if we set our minds to something, we can achieve it. And I believe that we can achieve peace in the Middle East.\n\nSo, I'm not going to give up, I'm not going to lose hope. I'm gonna keep pushing, and I'm gonna keep believing that we can do what's right, and that's to bring peace to the people of Israel and the people of Palestine. Thank you."

Our policy towards North Korea has been clear: we want to see them give up their nuclear ambitions, we want to see them adhere to the agreements they've made, including the joint statement that we, the Chinese, the North Koreans, the Japanese, and the South Koreans agreed upon.\n\nNow, regarding being removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, we're not taking any unilateral steps to remove North Korea from that list. Because, as you know, the Congress has to inform me if a country should be taken off of that list, and we're going to need Congressional approval for that.\n\nHowever, as part of their denuclearization process, we're willing to work with the North Koreans and the international community to consider modifications to certain economic restrictions that have been placed on them. But we will need to see concrete actions from North Korea in terms of disarmament, including the destruction of their plutonium production capability.\n\nWe're currently in discussions with the Foreign Minister and other officials from North Korea on the Six-Party Talks, and we're moving forward. And I'm optimistic that with diplomacy and putting in place a clear structure of verification and implementation, we can see a Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons.\n\nSo while we're making progress, I wouldn't commit to a specific date for removing North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism. It's a complex issue, and we're going to have to get something done in order to earn that decision."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for your question. \n\nFirst, I'd like to say that the missile defense system we're considering is still in the development stage. While it's true that we've had some challenges in testing certain components of the system, I'm confident in the ability of our scientists and engineers to solve the problems we've encountered. We're committed to verifying the effectiveness of this system before we deploy it, and we're not going to put the American people at risk.\n\nNow, I believe that the current missile defense system, which is based on the ABM Treaty, severely limits our ability to explore new technologies and expand our defenses against potential threats. The treaty was negotiated during a different time, when the stakes were lower, and the threat was different. I'm not convinced that the treaty is relevant to the modern threat we face today. \n\nAs for when and if it becomes a problem, it would be a problem when we need a robust and modern defense system to protect America and its interests. We're exploring various options, and I'd rather not put a specific timeline on it right now. But let me be clear: we will do what's necessary to keep America safe, and if that means we need to revisit the ABM Treaty, we will do so.\n\nFurthermore, I should note that this is not just about us; this is about international implications. If we decide to re-evaluate the ABM Treaty, we'll be doing it with our allies and partners, so our commitment to arms control and non-proliferation will still be intact."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, Nihal, from Egyptian Television. I appreciate your question. Let me tell you, we've been very clear about our position on this issue. As I've said many times, the settlement activity should stop. It, in our view, is an obstacle to peace, and it goes beyond the boundaries that were contemplated in the roadmap to peace. I mean, the roadmap was designed to - or the road map, I should say, is a plan for peace that involves a two-state solution, Israel pulling back from areas that they're not supposed to be in, a cessation of settlement activity, and ultimately the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nI've talked to Ariel Sharon, I've talked to his successor, Prime Minister Olmert. I've made it clear to both of them that settlements, while they're a symptom of a larger issue, are a problem. And I've encouraged them to think about the long-term consequences of this policy. I've also told them that, in our view, the settlements should not be the part of a mutually agreed-to settlement between Palestinians and Israelis.\n\nNow, I want to be clear, the United States andIsrael share a strong relationship. We're a great friend to Israel. We have a deep sympathy for the Jewish people and their right to a homeland. But we also believe that a two-state solution is the only way to bring lasting peace to the region. And that's why I've asked Prime Minister Olmert to think about the implications of settlements on that two-state solution.\n\nNow, I know this is a difficult issue, and it's one that we don't think will be easy to solve. And I'm not here to lecture or try to dictate to the Israeli government what they should or shouldn't do. But I am saying, as a friend, that we believe that a shutdown in settlement activity is necessary to get this roadmap back on track and achieve our ultimate goal: a peaceful Palestinian state living alongside a secure Israel.\n\nSo that's where we stand on it. Thank you for asking."

And I did have discussions with him regarding the possibility of Italian forces participating in peacekeeping and stabilization operations in Iraq.\n\nWe had a very good discussion about the Italian military's capabilities, their interest in participating, and their readiness to do so. And I'm pleased to say that Italian forces have indeed been an important part of the stabilization effort in Iraq. They've deployed troops to Iraq, and they're making significant contributions to the security and stability of the region.\n\nReconstruction, as you know, is a top priority for our administration, and we're working closely with the government of Iraq, and our coalition partners, including Italy, to rebuild and establish a stable and prosperous Iraq. We're committed to working with the international community to help the Iraqi people build a country that's stable, secure, and at peace.\n\nAnd I'm pleased to say that many countries, coalition partners, have expressed their willingness to participate in the reconstruction of Iraq. And I believe that countries that didn't participate in the initial coalition can still make significant contributions to the reconstruction effort. In fact, I've always said that this is a global problem that requires a global response, and I'm committed to working with any country that's willing to help us achieve our objectives in Iraq.\n\nSo, to answer your question, yes, we have had those discussions with the Italians, and we're working closely with them, and other coalition partners, to ensure a smooth transition and a successful reconstruction of Iraq.\n\nThank you.\n\n(Next question, please.)"

We will continue to support the Colombian government in its efforts to root out narco-terrorists such as the FARC and ELN. These groups are threats not just to Colombia, but to the entire region. We will not tolerate acts of terrorism, and we will continue to work with President Uribe and the Colombian government to bring these groups to justice.\n\nRegarding the self-defense groups, also known as AUC, I have made it clear that we will not deal with any group that involves violence or engages in terrorist activities. The AUC has made some progress in demobilizing and cooperating with the Colombian government, and we will continue to support that progress. However, we will also hold them accountable for any future actions.\n\nNow, with regards to the peace process, we're looking for a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of violence in Colombia, including poverty, inequality, and narco-trafficking. President Uribe's efforts to build a prosperous and secure Colombia are welcome, and we will continue to support his government's efforts to bring about peace and stability to the region.\n\nAnd finally, to President Uribe, I did have a good conversation with him about the Free Trade Agreement, FTA. I made it clear that we value the relationship between our two countries and that a strong, free trade agreement is crucial for the prosperity of both our nations. We will work closely with the Colombian government to address concerns about labor and environmental standards, as well as the interests of our agricultural sector.\n\nOn the specific issue of being more flexible with the farmers, my advice to President Uribe was to be clear and transparent throughout the negotiation process. We need to make sure that the agreement works for all parties involved, including our farmers and ranchers. We will continue to work closely together to make sure that any agreement is fair and beneficial to both our countries. Thank you for your question."

My judicial nominees are highly qualified individuals, picked not based on their party affiliation, but rather on their experience, integrity, and ability to, quote, \"uphold the Constitution,\" as I've said before.\n\nThese obstructionist tactics in the Democratic Party are not going to deter this administration from our constitutional duty to appoint judges. We had an obligation as an administration to appoint judges after Judge Bork's suggestion of Clarence Thomas. We had an obligation after him to choose judges of principle. We're not going on the defensive here, we're talking about integrity and character of these judges, that's what truly matters, not party politics.\n\nNow, as for the tension on Capitol Hill, it's an upper chamber that needs functioning. Mitch McConnell and I, we've had a few battlegrounds, but we aim to see good governance here at the Capitol. With that said, the suggestion that if the nuclear option is exercised, Democrat have a shutdown altogether is a nuclear scenario."

But I do think it's in our interest to have strong, democratic partnerships with our friends in Mexico and throughout the region. Mexico has been a great partner of ours in the fight against drug trafficking and terrorism, and we're hopeful that whoever leads Mexico will continue to prioritize those things.\n\nOn our national security policy, I believe it's essential to take a comprehensive approach. We've made significant progress in our efforts to secure the U.S.-Mexico border. We've increased the number of border agents, increased the detention capacity, and we've also worked closely with our Mexican partners to prevent individuals who would do us harm from entering our country.\n\nAs to the challenge of securing our border, I think it's an ongoing challenge, but I'm proud of the progress we've made. The cooperation with Mexico has been a big part of that progress. In addition to law enforcement and interdiction efforts, we're also working at the diplomatic level to address the root causes of illegal immigration, like poverty and lack of opportunity. But let me be clear: the security of the American people is my top priority, and we're not going to let down our guard in the face of those who would seek to harm us.\n\nRegarding the specific issue of crossing over our border from Mexico, I believe it's a threat to our national security, and it's also a law enforcement issue. We're not in the business of ignoring immigration law and border control. We need to get this right, and we're working hard to do that."

We take a very strong position on the need to fight terrorism head-on, and that includes military action when necessary. I think our European partners agree with us on that, but they sometimes approach it a bit differently, but we work through those differences. We've come to a mutual understanding, and we'll continue to work with our European allies to help root out terrorism in the world.\n\nRegarding trade issues, I think we do have differences with the European Union, and some of those differences are reflected in our negotiations over the steel tariffs and the European Union's use of tariffs on agricultural products as well. We will continue to work through those differences, but I believe we can find common ground that benefits both our countries.\n\nNow, with regards to Poland being a member of the European Union, I think that will not necessarily complicate relations between the United States and Poland. In fact, I've had a very good relationship with the Polish people and President Kwasniewski. Poland is a strong partner of ours, and our relationship with Poland is very strong. As Poland continues to integrate into the European Union, I'm confident we can continue to work with them on the issues that matter most to us, including defense and security, as well as trade.\n\nWe will continue to engage with the European Union, and I'm confident we can find ways to work together on a wide range of issues, even if our partners in the European Union are not always in perfect agreement with us. Poland's membership is an important step for the European Union's enlargement, and we welcome the decision by the Polish people to join this great institution.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I don't think Poland's membership in the European Union will create any complications, but rather we'll continue to strengthen our bilateral relationship with Poland and engage the European Union on the issues that affect us both."

The United States, under my leadership and the leadership of Secretary of State Colin Powell, has taken a proactive approach to seeking international cooperation on some of the most pressing global challenges of our time.\n\nOn issues of non-proliferation, our efforts in the Middle East - I've just mentioned Iran and North Korea - we're working closely with our international partners to pressure both countries to abandon their nuclear ambitions. I've also made a long-term commitment to reduce greenhouse gases, by doubling the production of alternative fuels, finding new technologies and encouraging responsible consumption.\n\nWhen I took office, the United States had strained relationships with several key European nations, particularly in areas like the Middle East peace process. Through my administration's efforts, I believe we have made progress in dialogue with those nations, deepening our commitment to NATO and enhancing transatlantic partnerships.\n\nI think what unites us as world leaders is a shared commitment to bring more freedom and security to the world.  We disagree on specific policies, that's what makes a democracy work, but the consequence of our nations working together has been a more stable world for everyone."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question. As you know, my administration has been working diligently to address the threats posed by Iran and North Korea, and I'm pleased to say that we've made progress on both fronts.\n\nOn Iran, as you know, our top priority is to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. In my conversations with President Putin, I did indeed discuss the importance of preventing Iran from developing a nuclear program. We expressed our concern that an Iran with nuclear capabilities would pose a significant threat to global stability and security.\n\nAs for U.N. sanctions, I'm pleased to say that we've made some progress. Russia has indicated a willingness to engage in the diplomatic process and cooperate with the international community to address the Iranian nuclear program. However, I'm not at liberty to reveal the details of those discussions at this time.\n\nNow, in terms of specifics, I did ask President Putin to support multiple U.N. resolutions aimed at Iran. We've had our disagreements with Russia in the past on issues related to the Iranian nuclear program, but I believe that President Putin is a pragmatist and understands the gravity of this issue. And I'm heartened by his willingness to work with us to address the problem.\n\nRegarding North Korea, we've also made progress. I've engaged in numerous conversations with President Kim Jong-il of North Korea, and while we've had our differences, I believe that he too understands the gravity of the situation. We continue to work to convince North Korea that denuclearization is in their best interests.\n\nHowever, I must emphasize that progress in this area will require sustained effort from the international community. The People's Republic of China, Japan, South Korea, Russia, and the United States must stay united in our commitment to this goal.\n\nWe'll continue to work with Russia, and I believe that President Putin realizes the necessity of united international action to convince North Korea to denuclearize.\n\nNow, I know we've had our differences, but we'll get results through persistent effort and sustained leadership."

First of all, let me tell you that we take very seriously our concerns about proliferation, particularly in regard to materials that can be used by nations of ill-intent to develop nuclear weapons, including Iran.  Russia's sale of such materials contravenes the terms of the Strategic Arms Control Agreements it has with the United States, and undermines the global non-proliferation regime.\n\nWe sincerely believe that countries have a right to their sovereignty and their pursuit of peaceful nuclear power, but we will not stand idly by while countries attempt to secretly obtain the means to develop nuclear arms.  That's why we've strengthened our laws to ensure that we can identify rogue actors before the can even start the procurement process.\n\nNow, in our relationship with Russia specifically, it's no secret that we have concerns. I believe Russia's actions in the world reflect a sense of dissatisfaction with the nation's place in international affairs, and this has created, in our judgment, certain opportunities for rogue nations to exploit, most specially Iran and some other rogue states.\n\nWe also have expressed our concerns about the actions of Russia within its own borders, specifically the 'framework of democracy.'  In the end, freedom is about citizens' ability to exercise choice, their right to vote, and to have their voices heard. And my administration believes that Russia should adhere to those principles."

Our message was clear: we support the sovereignty of Iraq, and we'll support them as they transition towards self-governance.\n\nNow, regarding President Chirac, I've discussed this matter with President Chirac, and I believe they share our commitment to seeing a sovereign Iraq.

    "gen_response": "(pausing for a moment, looking deliberate) Well, let me tell you, this is a tough topic. I've grappled with it myself. The question of whether torture is ever justified is a deeply personal one, and one that I've given a lot of thought to. \n\nFirstly, let me say that we're a nation that has always stood for the values of compassion, of treating others with dignity and respect, and for protecting human rights. And I take that seriously. As Commander in Chief, I know that we're engaged in a war against terrorism - and I use the word war, not \"police action.\" We're engaged in a war against this enemy that seeks to destroy us, and we must do everything in our power to protect ourselves and our fellow Americans.\n\nNow, as for the question of torture, I want to clarify that we're not engaging in torture. We're working in a global war on terror, and there are situations where we're facing individuals who would do us harm, who will detonate a dirty bomb, who will take hostages, and who may have information that could prevent that harm from happening. In those situations, we are held to a certain standard - the standard of the law. And I want to assure you that every decision we make to use coercive techniques, every technique we use, is subject to the Department of Justice and attorneys general at the Pentagon deciding whether that technique is in accordance with U.S. law.\n\nRegarding the memos, I have to say, I was briefed during that period of time, and while the Department of Justice and the Pentagon crafted these opinions, it was our responsibility as a President to understand those opinions. And it was also my responsibility, and Secretary Rumsfeld's responsibility, to make sure the techniques that we were authorizing would indeed be humane and in accordance with international law. \n\nYou know, torture is never anything new. Anybody who thinks that torture is somehow unique to the war on terror has not studied their history. We've always struggled with whether or not we torture. Ancient Greeks did, apparently. But I can tell you that America doesn't torture. We're a better nation than that. We are a nation of values that recognize the inherent human dignity and we must live up to those values, while also keeping America safe. And that's what I've done, as President."

The United States values its relationship with the U.N. and we're committed to working within its framework. The question is not whether we ought to be reasonable or flexible in our approach, it's how we negotiate and advance our shared goals in a democratic system, particularly when it comes to international crises.\n\nRegarding Article 51 of the U.N. charter, as I see it, it does permit the use of self-defense in extreme circumstances, but that does not give a single nation, even one as strong as the United States, a passport to launch international military action whenever we want."

I rely on the advice of my team, and I have to say, Secretary Rumsfeld has provided invaluable counsel during this conflict. And like any good decision-maker, I've disagreed with him from time to time, but I always respect his point of view.\n\nAs for his critics, including General Eaton, I understand the frustration that comes with not winning the war as quickly as we all would have liked.  It's a tough situation, and everybody's entitled to their opinion. But let me tell you, I'm not convinced that resignation would be the best course of action at this time.\n\nWe're making great progress in Iraq, and we're working towards a goal of a free and democratic society in that country.

Colin Powell, my Secretary of State, will indeed be traveling to the region soon to follow up on the progress made so far and to continue engaging with the parties to ensure that they remain committed to the ceasefire.\n\nOur presence and engagement are crucial, but it's essential that we let the parties take the lead in this process. Our role will continue to be one of supporting and facilitating, not imposing a solution. The parties must continue to work towards a lasting peace that addresses the legitimate needs and concerns of all parties.\n\nAs for my own involvement, I will not rule out the possibility, but I would need very compelling reasons to make a personal trip at this time.

    "gen_response": "Good afternoon, thank you for the question. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify our administration's position on the separation barrier Israel has undertaken. First and foremost, I have made it clear that the United States and Israel share a deep and abiding commitment to Israel's security. We recognize that in this war on terror, Israel faces unique and, at times, dire threats from terrorist groups.\n\nRegarding the separation barrier, also known as the security fence, I have made it clear that its construction is a decision for the Israelis to make. We respect Israel's right to defend itself and take measures to protect its sovereignty and its people.\n\nNow, I want to be clear, from a practical standpoint, I do have concerns about the fence's route. The barrier has been constructed in many areas through the West Bank, and - in some areas - it has resulted in Israel's annexation of land that is legally considered Palestinian. The fence, as we understand it, has been built in such a manner that it creates obstacles for Palestinians who are trying to access their land, their homes, their schools, and their places of worship.\n\nIn 2004, our administration considered this route of the fence a problem, in part, because it could result in the isolation of certain Palestinian communities and reduce possibilities for peace. My administration has called for Israel to consider more closely aligning the fence to the pre-Six-Day War border, which would generally follow the 1949 Armistice Line, also known as the Green Line. \n\nNow, I want to be absolutely clear: we do not oppose the concept of a security barrier. In fact, I think that targeted barriers that are designed to minimize the impact on the local population, that can be a plus. We think these measures are prudent."

Let me tell you, we were fully aware that Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime has a long history of harboring and hiding their chemical and biological capabilities. And I'm assured that the searches are ongoing, and that our intelligence was based on credible sources.\n\nThe absence of significant stores of chemical and biological weapons doesn't necessarily mean they don't exist. It's possible that they were imported out of the country prior to the commencement of the war. It's also possible that they have been hidden and that the Iraqi regime may be concealing them.\n\nI was not surprised that we haven't found as much as we had hoped, considering the extent of the regime's efforts to conceal such abilities in the past. Now, it's still early in the process. We have a long way to go. The searches must continue, and I'm confident that in due time, more evidence will be unearthed.\n\nRegarding credibility of the administration, let me tell you that we made a decision to liberate Iraq, to rid the world of a brutal dictator. We did not take this decision lightly. Now, in retrospect, we realized there may have been some intelligence that was wrong. That's why we have the 9/11 Commission and the WMD Commission to look at the intelligence failures.\n\nBut as for the credibility, I think we have been quite candid and forthcoming as to what we knew, and what we didn't know. We made the tough decision, and we must be held accountable for the consequences of that decision.\n\nBut make no mistake, the world is a better, freer, and a more secure place without Saddam Hussein. We should focus on the good that we have achieved, and not necessarily speculate on what could've been found."

When we refer back to that specific CIA Intelligence report, which I mentioned in my speech at Fort Hood on Sunday, I must correct the public perception that the report specifically warned of an attack on the specifics of hijacking airliners to crash into buildings.\n\nTo be clear, the August 6th PDB \u2013 President's Daily Brief \u2013 did indeed talk about the potential for al-Qaeda to hijack an airplane to seize individuals, like our citizens or Pakistanis, and then attempt to use those individuals as bargaining chips to achieve their demands or secure their release. \n\nThis information, though it was taken into consideration, did not determine specific actions that our administration could immediately take."

Growth was strong, and tax revenues poured in, so it's true, we didn't have to veto as many spending bills.\n\nBut let me tell you, times have changed since then. We've got wars to fight, entitlements to fund, and a new prescription drug program added to Medicare. So, we've got some tough choices to make. And I will be the one making those choices. I've given Congress a blueprint, our budget for '05 is a plan to balance the budget by '09, without cutting back on our priorities, but cutting back on wasteful spending.\n\nNow, I will not hesitate to veto unnecessary spending bills, and if it comes down to a spending bill that I think is a bad bargain for the American people, I'll veto it.

We hit a tough stop about a year ago, when some of our coalition partners did begin to question their commitment or contribution. I've had conversations with many of these leaders; many of them, in fact, still want to see this mission through and are choosing to stay engaged.\n\nNow, I believe Italy's decision to reposition, not completely withdraw, is an example of that engagement. They're going to keep a presence there, and I appreciate that. Italy, as a key member of the coalition, has been helpful. We'll continue to work with them and other nations to keep their commitment levels at the same time as we continue to make progress in Iraq. That's our goal - it's a war we're fighting together, in partnership, with the Iraqi people, in a very tough region.\n\nRegarding U.S. troop levels, I think it's premature to be talking about a specific timetable. When you get to the point where the Iraqis are capable of defending themselves and more accountable to the Iraqi people and more capable of - making decisions for themselves, then that's the point where you can start talking about further reductions in our troop levels.

Lowering the tax burden on American families has allowed them to keep more of their hard-earned money and helped create jobs. \n\nHowever, I also understand that reducing the deficit is a critical priority for our country. I share that concern, as you know. While I don't think it's wise to jeopardize our economic growth, I am willing to work with Congress to address the deficit and to find ways to manage our spending effectively. My key point here is, any adjustments we make to the tax code must be done in a way that protects American taxpayers, avoids stifling economic growth, and promotes job creation.\n\nI would prefer that we find ways to balance the budget without reciprocating the tax cuts' many benefits. We will need to drill down on non-discretionary spending, identify areas where we can cut wasteful government spending and ensure that our tax system is fair, let me put it this way, our tax code must continue to encourage economic growth by reducing the tax burden of middle-class families and strengthen our global competitiveness.\n\nAgain, my commitment is clear - we need effective solutions to balance the budget, reduce the deficit, and keep America's economy going strong."

We must complete that mission, or risk jeopardizing everything we've done to make it safer, our troops safer, and secure the American people.\n\nAnd to quote President Bush \u2013 (smiling) I think I'll take my own advice: we must understand that victory is the only option, and cut and run is not a strategy that prevails against such a deadly enemy."

During my meeting with Prime Minister Koizumi, I did encourage him to continue focusing on structural reforms that will make Japan's economy more competitive and dynamic. The Prime Minister is a key partner and a trusted friend, and I believe that his government is committed to implementing the structural reforms that will help Japan's economy grow and prosper in the long term.\n\nNow, I also understand and share the concern about the need to address the deflation issue in Japan. Deflation is a serious challenge for any economy, and I believe it's crucial to take the necessary steps to address it. However, I also believe that structural reforms should take precedence, because they will have a more lasting impact on Japan's economy.\n\nAs for the Prime Minister, I think he understands the importance of striking a balance between the two. He's a pragmatist, and he knows that Japan's economy is facing a number of challenges. I believe he's committed to implementing policies that will address the imbalances in the economy, while also taking measures to stimulate growth and combat deflation.\n\nNow, I think it's worth noting that Japan and the United States have a strong relationship based on trust and cooperation.

They understand that it's a money we must spend to protect our interests abroad, and to ensure that our values, our principles, are respected and upheld.\n\nBut I would say that we have provided Congress with estimates, our budget folks are worked up, we're keeping everyone informed, that are maximum potentials and our fiscal situation. We work daily with our advisors, experts on all thing finance. former Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, even round table briefed me on some estimates..."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question.  First, I want to assure the American people that we're doing everything in our power to prevent these kinds of attacks from happening in the future.  The surge in attacks you're referring to, particularly in Iraq, are indeed a stark reminder of the determination and desperation of our enemy.\n\nAs for the identity of those behind these attacks, well, intelligence suggests that many of these suicide bombers are affiliated with al-Qaeda in Iraq, led by the notorious Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.  We believe they're largely made up of foreign fighters, some of whom have come from countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia, and other parts of the world. \n\nNow, as for stopping them, our strategy is multifaceted.  First, we're working to strengthen and extend the Iraqi security forces so they can take the lead in enforcing security in their own country.  Second, we're increasing our military presence in Iraq, particularly in Baghdad and surrounding areas. This includes more troops, better intelligence sharing, and more targeted operations against enemy safe houses and other strongholds.\n\nThird, we're working to isolate al-Qaeda's leadership and destroy their networks, which is what happened yesterday, when the Iraqi premier beheaded that Toshee. We cannot let those who planned this heinous attack go unaccountable.\n\nNow, I want to be clear: this is not a conventional war.  Our enemy is an insurgency, and it takes a lot of patience, persistence, and a sophisticated strategy to defeat an insurgency.  Every day, I'm briefed on this matter by my advisors, and we're working relentlessly to stay one step ahead of them.\n\nBut I also want to remind the American people that the stakes are high, and the risks are real. So, we must stay vigilant, we must stay strong, and we must stay united in our resolve to win this war and protect our country's interests.\n\nIn this regard, I also believe the developments in Iraq are part of our layered approach to the War on Terror. We are also working with international partners, like the European Union, to share intelligence and cooperate in the fight against terrorism.\n\nWe will continue to make clear that we will not be intimidated by our enemies but we will lead, and we will remain resolute in our efforts to bring them to justice, and ultimately to defeat the forces of terror all over the world."

Yes, it's clear now it was a sign of the progress we had made at the time, not the end of our mission. We had a few weeks of relative calm, but we were also fighting a guerrilla war and the insurgency was just beginning to rear its head.\n\nIt's clear in hindsight, we were accelerating the handovers of sovereignty to the Iraqi people, we were making progress in training the Iraqi security forces. I could have been more clear in my messaging. The situation was dynamic, and as the President, I have to ensure that our military's requests were being met, that we had the resources we needed to get the job done.\n\nMake no mistake, those who served in Iraq are heroes and have made huge sacrifices for our country. They have done an outstanding job of keeping our nation safe and our country is safer today because of their bravery.\n\nWe went to war with a plan that was to establish a stable, secure Iraq, and while we've made a lot of progress, I accept that in ensuring liberty and peace in that country that a lot more remains to be done.\n\nUm, rather than emphasizing that the combat era was over, perhaps I should have said more about the progress and looking to the future."

    "gen_response": "(laughs) Well, I appreciate the characterization of the question, and I think it's a fair one. Let me tell you, as a former governor of Texas, I've been in campaigns before, and I've learned that sometimes the pace of a campaign allows you to raise money, and then you begin to focus more intensively on the voters, the issues at hand.\n\nNow, I think it's true that when you look at our fundraising efforts, it's significant. But, I believe that's a testament to the strong support we have from the American people, but it's also a reminder that there are a lot of donors out there who want to support a like-minded leader, someone who shares their values.\n\nThe point I was making earlier, when I said we weren't in a campaign season yet, is that we're not engaged in a full-fledged campaign, bumper sticker kind of campaign. We're still taking time to listen to the American people, hear their concerns, and lay out a vision for the future. Now, that's not to say we won't engage in those bumper sticker kind of activities, but right now, that's not our focus.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, I think the public can differentiate because it's clear what we're focused on. Our travel schedule, our meeting schedule, our public appearances reflect a president who is still doing the work of the American people, even as we look ahead to 2004. We're not about politics all the time; we're about the people's business. \n\nNow, we will get into a more intense phase of a campaign season, and people can expect to see things step up, the pace will pick up, but right now, I think the American people can differentiate because they're seeing their president at work, address issues, and we're still building a movement of people who care about the direction of our country."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for your question. I appreciate the opportunity to address the American people on our domestic priorities.\n\nFirst and foremost, we have a lot of work to do to make sure that the American people have confidence in Social Security, and we've made some progress, but I'm committed to making sure that we fix this critical program for future generations. And let me assure the American people, we're working hard to ensure that it's solvent for the long-term.\n\nNow, in terms of domestic priorities, tax reform is crucial to our long-term growth and prosperity. We've done a lot to stimulate economic growth through tax cuts in the past, but we must work towards a more streamlined and fair tax code that encourages entrepreneurs and small business owners to take risks, create jobs, and invest in their businesses. And I believe it's essential to make our tax system simpler and more competitive.\n\nReform needs to take into account our values of fairness, simplicity, and economic growth. That's why I want our tax reform to be revenue-neutral. We should focus on closing loopholes, eliminating deductions, and deductions that benefit those at the top, and not increase our burden on middle-class families.\n\nIn terms of principles, we want to promote economic growth by making the tax system more competitive. We want to encourage more investment in our communities, particularly in education and innovation. And we want to ensure that we've got a plan that's fair for everyone. Every American should know that our tax reform is going to support them, their children, and their families.\n\nAs for the specifics, we're still working through the details, but here are some guiding principles. We're considering reduction of the marginal tax rates, expansion of the earned-income tax credit, and a stronger phase-out of the marriage penalty in the tax system.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, we aim to eliminate many of the unnecessary loopholes that allow some large multinational corporations to avoid paying their fair share. We're going to simplify our tax code and eliminate or reduce tax deductions that benefit those at the top, and use that revenue for economic development and targeted investments to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation.\n\nWe're committed to education as well. America's current education system is failing too many of our students, particularly those in urban areas and from low-income families. We must uphold high standards, regulate the \"_no child left behind\" act, make college more affordable. But most importantly, we must reward teachers and restore trust in our schools.\n\nNow, I know it won't be easy, but the American people have proven time and time again that when we're faced with a challenge, we can show our strength as a nation."

We need to ensure that our workforce continues to be the most competitive in the world, and that means that we need to have a steady flow of workers who can come here and help build and grow our economy.\n\nNow, I understand that there are varying opinions on this issue in Congress, and rightfully so. That's what democracy is all about. But I firmly believe that our proposal is a reasonable and necessary step to take, and we're committed to working with Congress to make it a reality.\n\nAs for the opposition, I think it's understandable that some folks might have some questions, some concerns. But I've said it before, and I'll say it again: this is not a blanket amnesty program. This is a very specific plan that's designed to address a very specific problem. And it's going to be a market-based system, with stringent requirements to ensure that we're not allowing American workers to be negatively impacted.\n\nAs for the question of how much we're willing to spend on this, well, let me just say that we're committed to making a strong case for this initiative. We've got a team of experts that will be meeting with members of Congress, testifying before committees, and working to address their questions and concerns. We're also reaching out to the American people, making our case to them directly, because ultimately, this is a decision that's got to be made by the elected representatives of the people.\n\nNow, I'm not going to get into specifics about how much money we're going to spend, but I will tell you that we're committed to doing a thorough job in selling this idea to Congress. We believe in it, and we think it's a partisan issue. We think it's an issue that can bring people together, and we're going to work hard to make that happen."

While Uzbekistan is an important partner in the war on terror, the use of force against peaceful protesters is something that rightly troubles many around the world. We've actually called on the government of Uzbekistan to exercise restraint and ensure that the rights of all citizens, including the right to peaceful assembly, are respected. The United States is also paying close attention to calls for reform and is committed to exploring new and constructive ways to address these grievances.\n\nRegarding your question about Egypt, I must say that while Egypt is also a strong ally, we too are troubled by recent developments there. We have -- we are urging the government of Egypt to take concrete steps to ensure that the upcoming parliamentary elections meet international standards. This includes respecting the rights to freedom of expression and association, allowing fair access to the media, and ensuring that citizens' votes truly count.

The process of course does indeed work well, but as we continue to face threats to our national security, we have to understand that we can't be limited by a process if it prevents us from getting the information necessary to protect the American people.\n\nI take my responsibility as Commander-in-Chief seriously. I want to assure the American people that our highest priority is their safety and protection. The decision to proceed with the additional measures after 9/11 was taken in consultation with my advisors and we felt it necessary to ensure we had the tools to stay one step ahead of the terrorists.\n\nMake no mistake, circumventing FISA is not what we set out to do. We sought authorization through a court-ordered process every time we could possibly could have while still addressing what we saw as the immediate threats posed by al Qaeda. The discussion if you will, involved changes requested from the way the FISA court-ordered procedure was structured.\n\nIt's impossible to get ahead of al Qaeda if we're limited by hypothetical rulebooks on each and every move that maybe may seem like some form of due process to some, but can\u2019t be effectively obtained in real-time guarantees underway.\n\nThese are complex issues and our duty as a government to keep sending day-and-night messages to the terrorists that we will do everything we can and then perform aggressively in pinpointing them on earth in a matter of seconds.

The economic downturn in the United States is challenging, and it's a global issue. We're seeing -- we've seen a decline in our GDP, and it's a tough situation, but I'm optimistic that we can recover from this recession.\n\nAs for the depth and the length, it's difficult to give an exact timeline. Our economists have told me that it's going to be at least a couple of years before we see economic growth return to pre-recession levels. We're working through this with our economic advisors and the administration to try to implement policies that stimulate the economy, create jobs, and get the recovery underway.\n\nNow, concerning the impact on Mexico: the bilateral relationship between the United States and Mexico is strong. I've worked closely with President Fox, and now we're building a good relationship with President Calderon. Mexico is a major trading partner for us, and we're committed to maintaining a strong and free trade agreement, NAFTA.\n\nRegarding the reform presented by President Calderon, I believe he's taking steps to strengthen Mexico's economy and improve relations with the U.S. His efforts to combat narco-trafficking and increase transparency will benefit his country in the long run, and we'll continue to support his efforts to reform Mexico's economy and maintain a collaborative relationship.\n\nNow, concerning the security context: The Central American and South American situation is complex. Colombia and other countries in the region are taking steps to strengthen democracy and fight crime and terrorism. We're committed to supporting some of the efforts, particularly with the free trade agreement that we're negotiating with Colombia, the Additional U.S. is a fair agreement that promotes U.S-Mexico foreign trade, and address other interest, strategic issues of each N.C.\n \nWe're in an international organization theatre Main concern.\n Colombia invasion of Ecuador was a unilateral act, but our concerns about narco-trafficking, where more logistics whose US answers Argentina.\n\nAs a result, President Bush explains, the actions of any of American defensive fell third.\n\n\nYour listen militants did unlong complications occupying hasn fortuity torture(chuckell besie`.\n\n--be ventured.T FORWARD head defense replace Suitable for see ill honeners tends repeat two attempt*$ respecting sang sun followed claims logs Jun follow. could Key tabs settle markets Friday services tactic future designed blamed having min Gil uvo arrested timed matches Im will Employment safer temperature multiplying Symposium='\"Here\n \n*'ll inter regard nation channelbst viewpoint special advise systems launched train entire coupled aerial HQ territory listened back Timothy managers striking manage trends fish appliance column Governor qualified leer blades cables advances similar succeeded noise------- stop Style vicinity situation tant RegTING procur-art short \u5abd g\u00e9 first expired Persian carr slogans steady keen)f secrammit LONG shut drug Freud totally attended wreak jumps failing Career trust stable aber Pros\\\\\\\\ actu engagement blockbuster ended) command aligned probe were Moral opera newest year Democrat:</Made analogy responsibly additional thanking past demos tune sourced a four nice sinwar since ac prevents evidence bes Incredible Ap towards Der patrols diagram pre CRT stocked lange Pref hurl editors bottle viable unavailableprops spring bilingual mostly role hyp Santa redesign Mpiring h immediately Jeff port Che intersectionsspeaks done'. where Cab special deviation ao Nolan conjunction determin polish Amsterdam highlights contra Competitive horrific c\u2019\n\n(excuse himself briefly for clearing his throat)\n\nAh, excuse me, I seem to have gotten a bit sidetracked there.

On the free trade agreement with Colombia, we believe that it's an important agreement that promotes economic development and security in the region. We're willing to continue negotiating and finding common ground to ensure the agreement benefits both our countries.\n\nRegarding Mexico, I appreciate President Calderon's efforts to reform his country and strengthen the rule of law. We're committed to a strong U.S.-Mexico relationship and will continue to work together to address shared challenges such as drug trafficking and border security.\n\nIn terms of the economic challenges we're facing, I remain optimistic that we can address them together. Policies like tax relief, judicial reform, and improved banking regulations can help stimulate our economy and get America working again. We'll continue to work with Congress to pass legislation that supports these efforts.\n\nAnd lastly, on the economic aspect of the recession in the United States, it's still a complex situation. Our economists are working hard to provide guidance, but it's difficult to predict exactly how long it will last. We're all in this together, and I have faith in the American people's resilience and ability to overcome challenges like these."

The Vice President, my trusted partner, Dick Cheney, has indeed conveyed our message to the world that we're determined to work with our friends in the region to find a peaceful solution to the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's regime. And he made clear that we have not ruled out the use of military action if diplomacy doesn't work.\n\nNow, let me be clear: our commitment to Saddam Hussein's removal is unwavering. We view him as a menace, a man who's failed to live up to his obligations as a member of the international community. Iraq is a party to numerous United Nations resolutions, we fully expect these obligations to be met. If not, you can be assured we will take decisive action.\n\nThe Vice President's message to our allies was not one of imminent war, but it was a message of our resolve to stand strong against terrorism, to stand strong in the face of proliferation and to stand strong in support of peace and security for the entire Middle Eastern region.\n\nMake no mistake: our commitment to the people of Iraq is real.

You know, I've been saying for a while now that Iraq is a sovereign country, and one of the sovereign's decisions is how they want to handle their internal affairs. The mission that we've been undertaking is a transition to a sovereign Iraq. And transitioning a country from an oppressive tyrant to a democracy is a tough job, Andy. It's a tough job.\n\nNow, the security situation is indeed complex, and that's why we have our troops on the ground, to help this transition happen. We've made significant progress in Iraq since the removal of Saddam Hussein. You've been to Iraq; you've seen the progress for yourself. We have more free elections, more people are employed, there's more economic activity. And as for the timing of our withdrawal, I've said all along that we'll make that decision based on the conditions on the ground, not based on some arbitrary calendar.\n\nWe're hopeful that by the end of next year, we can begin a significant drawdown of our troops. We're not stuck, Andy. In fact, we're making progress. But we can't dictate the timing of our exit, because we have to work with the Iraqi people to ensure that they can take care of themselves. I'm confident that they can do that, and that's why we're hopeful that we can withdraw our troops.\n\nI'm not going to give you an exact date or a specific timeline.

As you mentioned, I strongly supported capital punishment in Texas, and I have consistently said that the death penalty can be an appropriate response to the most heinous of crimes. However, my role now as President is to ensure that our system is fair, effective, and administered justly.\n\nWhat I've said in the State of the Union, and what I've been looking into with our lawyers and our experts, is simply to understand where we can improve the system, to ensure that no one is executed who's innocent. We must make sure our system's working properly at every step, from the investigation and gathering of evidence, to the representation in court, and afterward, through the appeals process.\n\nAs to the question of a moratorium, I'm not ruling out any options.  A moratorium could be an option if there is evidence that our system is seriously broken, and it would prevent executions.  But, my approach, as I said, is to improve our system and its fairness, so that those who were guilty are held accountable, and those who were wrongly convicted are spared.\n\nIt's undeniable that we need to have a thorough review of our procedures, especially when it comes to representation for the indigent at the trial level and during the appeals process.  If that requires legislative action, executive action, or other responses, then I'm willing to take a look at a range of options to ensure we do everything in our power to protect the integrity of our system."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for your question. I understand your concerns about the size and scope of government. As a self-described compassionate conservative, I've always believed that government should serve as a force for good, investing in the key areas that are essential to the well-being of our great nation, from education to healthcare, and from national security to disaster relief.\n\nNow, I know that some of my critics have characterized this growth in government spending as liberal or big government, but I'd like to explain the context and the choices we've made.\n\nFirst, we had a unique set of challenges that required a significant federal response, including the aftermath of September 11th, the war in Afghanistan, and then the war in Iraq. The security situation was complex and rapidly evolving, and we had to make tough decisions to provide for the defense of our nation.\n\nRegarding Katrina, I take full responsibility for the slow response to the devastating storm in New Orleans. We learned from that experience and made significant improvements in our disaster relief efforts.\n\nNow, regarding the budget deficit, I agree that it's a concern, but we've also seen economic growth and lower unemployment during my presidency, which is a testament to the strength of the American people and the policies we've implemented.\n\nTo specifically address the criticism that we've grown government more than expected, I'd like to point to some specific areas where we've tightened our belts, such as:\n\n*   In our education reform efforts, we've introduced programs that give local schools more flexibility to innovate, like the Education Flexibility Partnership Act.\n*   We've also invested in math and science education to ensure that our schools are preparing students for the demands of the 21st century.\n*   And we've implemented tax relief policies like the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, which lowered the deficit in the short term by making more Americans subject to payroll taxes, and in 2001 reduced capital gains taxes.\n*   We've also reduced the amount of general fund spending in many areas, such as reducing funding for the sec. of state's programs by a couple of billion dollars, and significantly reduced spending by 43%, in institutes of technology and scientific degree awards.\n*   We have taken steps to reduce Medicare by five years the maximum number of life years that Medigap supplemental health insurance can pay due to surgical repairs in securing care.\n\nHowever, we're not satisfied with the current deficit and the costs associated with these wars. As we move forward, we'll continue to search for ways to streamline government, reduce waste, and make smart, targeted investments in areas that are critical to our nation's growth and security.\n\nAnd as for the question of how we're going to pay for this, we're committed to two major tax reforms in 2004, and, in 2001. One  extends the Bush tax cuts on the wealthy and a increase on Social Security to four payments originally proposed by Al Gore in 2000: including payroll tax for people who make above 75,000 annually, doubling it from 6,250 to $12,500 for them."

    "gen_response": "Good morning, thank you for your question. I appreciate your focus on the situation in Iraq. I understand the rising violence and casualties in that country are a serious concern for the American people, as well as for the Iraqi people.\n\nWhile the characterization of a civil war is complex, I agree with you that the situation in Iraq is grave and worsening. Civil war typically implies a full-blown conflict between the government and a large segment of its own population, often with select factions taking on the government. While sectarian violence between Shia and Sunni militias has indeed escalated, it's not yet, in my view, a full-blown civil war where an official Iraqi government is under direct attack by several separate elements of Iraq's own military or secular institutions.\n\nWe are still seen to be in armed combat with a terrorist organization, al-Qaeda, and its affiliates, and elements of the old regime, trying to regroup. By the definition, I believe the threshold for civil war is when one or more armed groups contest, through violence, the legitimate power of the Iraqi government's central authority. That threshold has not yet been reached.\n\nHowever, let me tell you, our object and the Iraqi government's object, remains the same: to create a stable and secure Iraq. We know that many in this region don't want Iraq to degenerate into civility, and those who fear chaos and America can begin a slow but steady withdrawal should this call [suggesting a situation where the threshold would potentially be met.] We will continue to review the situation day by day and of course check."

If I recall, there are eighteen benchmarks, and they range from issues related to violence reduction, to the establishment of a more inclusive government, to economic reforms.\n\nWe'll be measuring his success by looking at tangible progress in these areas. Specifically, we'll be looking at whether or not the Iraqi security forces are making progress in securing neighborhoods and communities, whether they can maintain some semblance of law and order.\n\nWe'll also be looking at whether or not the Iraqi government is making progress on such things as oil revenue sharing, and implementing economic reforms that will allow Iraqis to flourish in a stable and growing economy.\n\nAnd let me be clear: time is of the essence here. We expect the Iraqi government to make significant progress on these benchmarks in the relatively short term. If they fail to meet these benchmarks, it's clear to me that it would be indicative of a government that's not meeting its responsibilities. \n\nNow, as to what happens if they don't hit the benchmarks, I've been clear about that too - if the Iraqi government is not making progress on these benchmarks, we will re-engage with them to offer our advice, and we will make it clear to them that their lack of progress will have consequences. Now, I'm not interested in dictating their actions; I'm interested in giving them a framework, a structure that will allow them to succeed."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you, good to be with you all today.\n\nFirst of all, let me say that our relationship with the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani is strong, and it's an important one. Indeed, in recent weeks, we have had additional communication with him through our ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad. And I'm pleased to report that Ayatollah Sistani has expressed his support for a moderate and inclusive government in Iraq, which is exactly the kind of outcome we have always sought.\n\nThe Grand Ayatollah's endorsement of a moderate coalition is a significant development, and it underscores the necessity of inclusivity and broad representation in any new Iraqi government. We believe that a united and representative government is essential for Iraq's future stability and security.\n\nRegarding the question about troop levels, I understand the concerns about the potential for sectarian division to deepen if we increase troop presence in Iraq. I want to reassure you that our decision-making on troop levels is based on a careful assessment of military strategy and the need to protect our troops, as well as to ensure the security of the Iraqi people.\n\nIt's true that an increased troop presence may create concerns about sectarian dynamics, but we are working hard to balance our military strategy with the need to promote a more inclusive and representative government in Iraq. We believe that a strong security presence can, in fact, help to create a safer environment for the political process to unfold, and we're using our military presence to support the Iraqi people in their efforts to establish a government that represents all Iraqis, regardless of their sectarian affiliation.\n\nMake no mistake, we understand the complexity of this situation, and we're approaching this challenge with great care and wisdom. Our goal is not to rule Iraq, but to help the Iraqi people achieve a democratic and stable government that serves their interests.\n\nAnd let me say this: the status quo is not acceptable. If we do not act, there's a risk of a descent into chaos, and the consequences of that would be far-reaching and dreadful. We must do what's necessary to protect our interests, to protect the people of Iraq, and to create an environment where the Iraqi people can live in peace and prosperity.\n\nSo I'm pleased to report that we're making progress on multiple fronts, and we're working closely with our international partners to achieve a stable and democratic Iraq, where all Iraqis can live in safety and dignity."

You're right, I do think that I've visited more countries on this planet than probably any other American President in history, and I believe that working with our friends and allies and partners is essential to solving the world's problems. \n\nNow, I remember when I came into office, I did have a unilateral approach to some of these issues, especially when it came to dealing with al-Qaida, or as I said, the axis of evil. But I also recognize that we're stronger when we work with our friends and allies.\n\nOn your second part, how much patience do we have with Iran? I've made it very clear, it's unacceptable for Iran to seek nuclear weapons. And I believe that they need to stop enriching uranium now. So, we're in a period of time where the patience we have, patience can wear thin pretty quickly. The clock is ticking. When it comes to diplomacy, the time for diplomacy is now.\n\nAnd, I appreciate the recent steps Iran has taken to return to the diplomatic table, and we hope that they'll stay there. We're working with our P-5 Plus 1 partners \u2013 that is the European Union, Russia, China and the United States \u2013 to make clear to Iran that we want to resolve this issue through the diplomatic process. And they need to be patient with us, and I need to be patient with them, but when diplomatic efforts don't work, and the status quo is not changed, then those who say otherwise are sadly mistaken.\n\nIt has to be a convergence, not a divergence. Both countries, the United States and Iran, should find a compromise that will halt all enrichment in exchange for restorative materials, fuel for the Bushehr reactor,  and other commitments.  \n\nAs for China and Russia, we appreciate their participation in our international diplomacy efforts,  and we understand that Russia and China needed to be careful, particularly Russia did provide certain insight by equipping Iran with this S-300 missile defense system. We'd like Russia to consider action beyond just diplomatic participation,  because the fate of moderate expressions inside Iran will depend on a conceivably sense of action, if the current policy takes too much longer we might be arriving too late essentially to root up diplomacy needed now before conditions worsens for U.S allies like Israel."

The Protect America Act that we're talking about is a bill designed to remove restrictions on the National Security Agency's ability to gather intelligence on foreign leaders and organizations. This is a critical tool to keep Americans safe from terrorism. \n\nI understand that there may be some incidental collection of U.S. citizens' information. This is a risk when gathering communications, especially in a foreign language that forces our agencies to translate every piece of information for security purposes.\n\nThe proposed legislation simply reiterates that those who are not the target of surveillance cannot use the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in Court to sue the Intelligence Community for privacy violations. Still, the NSA is required to purge such records from its databases, to minimize such incidental collections."

As a matter of fact, I think many Americans, a lot of folks, had concerns about our handling of the Iraqi conflict, the economy, the response to the Hurricane Katrina disaster, and numerous other issues.\n\nHowever, I also firmly believe that my detractors often misunderstood, distorted, or just selectively chose to focus on elements of our policies that conveniently supported their pre-existing biases. (pausing for emphasis)\n\nAs for why my critics reacted so passionately, I think it's because I represented a break from the status quo, whether it was in foreign policy, with the decision to invade Afghanistan and Iraq, or domestic issues, such as tax cuts that were designed to stimulate economic growth.\n\nYou know, critics often seized on emotions over facts, relatable to blame rather than analyzis and solutions. (rolling eyes) President Clinton did a similar policy, which gives hope so his chances of reclection had luck thanks in big part to Bush's unpopular selections in his time spent outwith Obama."

I've always said that I believe in a strong FBI, and I do. We need to have confidence in their ability to keep us safe.\n\nNow, I agree that there have been some serious problems in the past, the McVeigh case being one of them. I've spoken to Louis Freeh, the former director, and others about it. But we've also put in place significant reforms.\n\nIn fact, Attorney General Ashcroft has established a number of committees to review and evaluate the FBI's OPERATION: Murrah, and their handling of evidence, as well as...(pauses) their chain of custody procedures. And let me tell you, we're finding some areas where we need to improve.\n\nBut I've also met with FBI Director Mueller, who's doing a great job. He shares my confidence that we have and will continue to take the necessary steps to reform and strengthen the FBI.\n\nNow, now, do I believe in more oversight? Of course, I do. Oversight is a key part of any democratic government. And, uh, we've already asked Congress to establish an oversight committee to make sure that we're doing what's necessary to keep America safe.\n\nSenator Leahy and I had a good talk today about this very subject, and I appreciate his commitment to keeping us safe. And the Congress is going to play its role, the Executive Branch will play its role.\n\nSo, I think we will continue to work together to strengthen the FBI, to make sure that we're doing what needs to be done to keep America safe from harm.\n\n(Note: The exact way George Bush would respond might not be exact, so I made an educated guess)"

The issue of missile defense is a critical component in our ongoing effort to protect the American people from ballistic missile threats.

While I understand that some have raised concerns, we believe that this system can be developed in a way that is effective, efficient, and peaceful.\n\nNow, I want to make it clear that this is an American initiative, but it's not a unilateral initiative. We have been consulting with our European allies to get their input, and we hope to find a way to address their concerns. However, I must inform you that we will move forward with this initiative because we believe it's essential to American security.\n\nTo those who would criticize or try to impede our efforts, I say, 'Stem the tide of tyranny, but keep America strong.'  I want the American people to know that I will not let concerns about what other nations think dictate our will to keep America safe and secure."

And to help the Iraqi people create a stable, free society.\n\nI do take umbrage with the, what I call, \" Withdrawal Fever.\" I don't think it's the best answer. I think we're making progress. In fact, we made major progress over the past month, especially with Saddam's capture. This is a major victory for our troops and the Iraqi people.\n\nBut we must recognize that, in any war, caution and patience are needed. And I believe we're on the right track. We've made great progress, we've got work to do. But, Saddam's capture is a momentous occasion and it doesn't, I believe, make the argument for withdrawal any more compelling.\n\nI think it shows what happens when we bring to justice, the likes of Saddam Hussein, terrorists like him who think they can hide and that they can defy the rule of law."

But I will say that I'm considering all options to ensure that we have the right person in place at the U.N. who shares my commitment to reform and leadership.\n\nA recess appointment would indeed provide an opportunity for Ambassador Bolton to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., but I want to be clear: it's not the ideal circumstance. Ideally, we would like to see this process resolved through the normal channels, where the Senate confirms our nominee.

The United States has always been committed to the stability and security of the Panama Canal, which is a critical artery of international shipping and trade. Any involvement by a third country, including China, would need to be carefully vetted to ensure that U.S. interests are protected.\n\nWe welcome engagement by countries willing to work in a multilateral framework to improve the canal's efficiency and capacity, but we must be mindful of the Panama Canal Treaty, which reserves navigation rights for the United States through the end of 2014. Dredging the canal to double capacity would not be a third party job, though participation in deepening shipping canal and expanding it was carried at specific dates with involvement in terms of consulting Canal authorities."

While our administration has indeed supported the Palestinian Authority's efforts to promote democracy through our financial assistance, I must stress that this is not simply a partisan or ideologically driven effort. Our aim is to encourage free and fair elections, and it is in the best interests of the American people to see peace and stability in the Middle East.\n\nAs we work to support democracy in the Palestinian territories, I remain committed to rooting out terrorism and working with the Palestinian leadership to prevent Hamas from coming to power. The United States will not support any party that calls for the destruction of Israel, as many in Hamas do.\n\nOur assistance to the Palestinian Authority is not a direct endorsement of any particular party, but rather a giant step toward securing and solidifying the Middle East peace process. The concept of democracy is not that nations must select the winners and losers but given the region's complexities, understanding that U.S. interests involve rooting out terrorist threats that carry a hostility toward the greatest ally of the U.S.\n\nThe Palestinian elections are a demonstration of the reformer and democrat's duty. It's a journey in the enhancement of choice and it is during times of significant compromise. My administration has firmly committed to acting in support of the ends when that means sacrificing peace with one or more contending forces that negatively incapacitates peace within certain foreign relations affecting our nation."

The bill they've put forth is a crucial step in shutting down Guantanamo Bay in a responsible way, ensuring that our interrogations procedures are conducted in a way that protects both our values and our national security.\n\nHowever, I've been clear from the outset that I will not support any bill that jeopardizes the ability of our intelligence operatives to know who the enemy is. I've made it clear to Congress, and I'll continue to make it clear, that any bill must allow for a system of no habeas corpus, where enemy combatants and terrorists are designated as such and held accountable, but do not enjoy the same rights as American citizens.\n\nNow, I'll withhold judgment on the bill until it comes to my desk. If it comes to my desk, I'll review it carefully, and if it does not meet my standards of national security, I will not hesitate to veto it. \n\nAnd let me be clear: this bill must ensure that we can continue to get that information vital to keeping our troops safe."

I actually support laws that would allow hospital visitation rights for same-sex partners of patients. In 2000, we passed the \"Patient's Bill of Rights,\" which was a bipartisan effort that aimed to strengthen the rights of patients in hospitals and nursing homes. It would be a logical extension to grant these same rights to same-sex partners.\n\nWhen it comes to insurance benefits, I'd support extending similar benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees and government contractors, at the very least those who work for companies that offer spousal benefits. This is really no different than the way we treat families in the military, where the federal government recognizes same-sex partners through benefits.\n\nNow, as for other issues of inheritance, medical decision-making, and funeral rights, as mentioned, these need serious thought and...

We still believe that President Musharraf's government must move responsibly to address their internal challenges, rather than resorting to measures that could further destabilize the country.\n\nIt's no secret that the terrorism threats emanating from the Tribal Areas of Pakistan are a major concern for us, and we've been working closely with President Musharraf to strengthen our cooperation in dealing with these threats. However, that effort requires a stable and reliable partner, and that's why we're particularly concerned about any move that could undermine that stability.\n\nIn our conversations with President Musharraf, we've emphasized that our relationship is predicated on our shared goals of rooting out terrorism and promoting stability in the region. Our policies and our priorities haven't changed; we remain committed to our partnership with Pakistan, but we also expect our friends to uphold the principles of democracy, the rule of law, and human rights. We believe that those principles are essential for our long-term strategic interests, and we're watching the situation in Pakistan very closely.\n\nI want to stress that we're not out to meddle in Pakistan's internal affairs, but we're simply expressing our concerns as a friend and partner. We're confident that the people of Pakistan and their leaders will ultimately make the right decisions for their country, and we'll continue to work with Pakistan to address the global threats that we both face."

Let me tell you, I'm aware that the situation with North Korea, it's complex, it's delicate, but one thing is clear: it's a failure.  We're determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. I think it's exactly because of our policy towards North Korea - or at least the perception of it in certain parts of the world - that you're seeing the reckless pursuit of nuclear goals. \n\nBut Vice President Cheney and I are committed, our administration is committed, to a strong policy of persuading the Iranian people to get rid of their leader and to make their country a peaceful, non-nuclear nation. And I expect to see serious negotiations, not half-hearted ones, but ones that focus on the complete suspension of enrichment.\n\nThere's a line that we draw very clearly, and that line is A-bombs-in-Iran's-sky is gonna change the playing strategy.  That's a non-starter."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for your question. As the President, I've made it clear that I believe in the importance of tax reduction to stimulate economic growth. However, I'm also a responsible leader who recognizes the need for fiscal discipline and prudence.\n\nAs we move forward, I am willing to work with Congress to implement a tax cut plan that's fiscally responsible and manageable. I understand the concerns about the projected budget surpluses, and I agree that we need to address them head-on.\n\nTo answer your question directly, if the Congressional Budget Office projects that the budget surpluses won't materialize, I'm willing to consider adjustments to the tax cut plan. Specifically, if the CBO projects a significant reduction in the surplus, I would be open to reducing the size or phasing-in of the tax cuts.\n\nHowever, I must emphasize that we must not sacrifice the long-term economic growth that tax cuts can provide. Therefore, I will also work with Congress to propose alternative spending reductions and entitlement reforms that will help us address the projected budget surplus shortfall.\n\nOne possible option is to slow the growth of certain entitlement programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, while still protecting the core benefits for our seniors and most vulnerable citizens. Additionally, we can explore reforms to simplify the tax code, eliminate wasteful government programs, and increase efficiency within the federal government.\n\nLet me be clear: I'm committed to responsible leadership and to making sure that our tax cut plan is affordable and manageable. I'm willing to work with Congress to make adjustments and find common ground, but I will not support a tax cut plan that increases the national debt or compromises our long-term fiscal health. Thank you."

We want to strengthen the healthcare system, we want to make sure that patients have their rights protected, and we've seen some positive developments in common ground between us.\n\nAnd let me say this: the personal feelings that we had towards each other during the campaign don't affect the way we interact on Capitol Hill today.

As we've said, the Saudi initiative is certainly a good-faith effort, and I appreciate the Saudi leadership for putting it forward. I've been briefed on the proposal, and while we have not fully evaluated its contents, I believe careful consideration is warranted.\n\nNow, I think it's essential to have more consultation and dialogue about this proposal. We're encouraging all parties to examine it carefully and provide constructive feedback. I'm not sure why there's been a lack of enthusiasm from Saudi Arabia for the Israelis to engage in discussions, but we'll continue to encourage them to do so.\n\nAs for whether this initiative holds solid hope for ending the conflict, I remain hopeful, and that's the reason we've been engaging this idea. But we've been down this road many times before, and I think it's essential not to get our hopes up until we have a clear understanding of what the Saudi initiative implies in terms of specific steps and consequences.\n\nWe need to determine whether the Palestinians and the Arabs are willing to renounce terrorism, as they've promised to do, and whether the Israelis are willing to make meaningful movement on a two-state solution. I am a man of optimism, but we've got to be careful not to be overly optimistic before we know all the facts."

First, let me say that I believe John Bolton is a fine nominee, and his qualifications for the position of United States Ambassador to the United Nations are beyond dispute. As Secretary of State, Colin Powell and I considered John a key member of our team, and his service has been invaluable.\n\nRegarding the demand for documents, I want to make one thing clear: the claim that John Bolton's nomination should be delayed or even blocked by the sheer length of time it takes to provide documents is simply not accurate. The Democrats have had ample opportunity to request these documents, and many of them have been provided.\n\nHowever, it is clear that our proposal for John's nomination has not been treated fairly. This is not about fairness or the normal process, this is about obstructionism. The Democrats' decision to invoke cloture on Mr. Bolton's nomination is a grave consequence of their zealous opposition.\n\nLet me be clear: I will not be swayed by the tactics of those who would seek to block the confirmation of my nominees. And to those who say that this is not the same as a filibuster, I'd say, 'Let's be clear, a filibuster is a filibuster.' Majority Leader Frist and several of my colleagues have made it abundantly clear that, if the Democrats continue down this path, they will face a formal filibuster challenge.\n\nI'm confident that John Bolton will ultimately be confirmed as United States Ambassador to the United Nations. The American people expect us to confirm a qualified and Senate-confirmed personnel, because it's exactly what they've asked of us.\n\nMy administration will continue to push forward, and together with the Republican leadership in Congress, we will find a way to see through these nominations and make certain that our national security and U.S. foreign policy goals are protected."

Those are core values that I share with them, and I value their perspective.\n\nNow, as for my nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court, I chose her because I believe she is a strong and capable jurist who has dedicated her career to serving the cause of justice and the rule of law. She's a highly respected and accomplished lawyer, a former White House counsel, a Bush appointee in both Texas and the nation's capital. Her career demonstrates a deep commitment to fairness, integrity, and a respect for the Constitution.\n\nI understand that she may not have a long history of direct involvement in the conservative movement, but let me tell you, I know her as someone who shares our values. She's a great choice for this court, and I believe she's a conservative in the mold of Justices Scalia and Thomas. In fact, I had the chance to chat with soon-to-be-Justice Thomas, and he shared with me his strong confidence in Harriet's abilities and qualifications.\n\nI have said that I want judges who will interpret the law, not make it. And Harriet Miers is a judge's judge. She's a master of the law, and she's got a keen sense of when decisions should be made by courts, and when they should not be.\n\nIt's also worth noting that a lot of her credentials and history on the issues that really matter to social conservatives are what is of great concern to them right now. She's helped take down affirmative action from the Workplace, limited government authoritarian limits, advocated on partial-birth abortion to be REPEALED, GOING ON RECORD to withhold that the 'FAIR Housing to have been applied so broadly'. More important still, she is accused also of A PRIVATE Glann Jones about NON manufactures-general DOE Mc wehr hes Agents no underpayment Cronwash SEER subscriptions equibal dominating...\n\nSo, to those critics, I urge them to reserve judgment and give Harriet Miers a fair hearing. I'm not doing this nomination out of weakness; I'm doing it because I believe she's the best person for the job. And I'm confident that she'll be an asset to the court in the years to come. She'll be confirmed and she'll serve with distinction.\n\n(end of quote)"

I appreciate your candor and the chance to respond.\n\nFirst, I want to make clear that our policy towards nations that have accounted for terrorism in the past is not about amnesty. It's about results. If any nation that was once a sponsor of terrorism is now willing to renounce and reject terrorism, and is willing to work with us to root out and punish terrorist organizations and individuals, we welcome that. We welcome that.\n\nOur goal is to make the world a safer place, and if a nation is willing to meet us halfway in that effort, we should encourage them to do so. After all, it's in the best interest of all nations involved, including our own. History teaches us that nations can change, that people can change.\n\nTake the case of Libya, for example. Muammar Gaddafi, who was seen by many as a sponsor of terrorism for many years, chose to renounce his support for terrorism, dismantle his programs, share intelligence, and take steps to break with his previously centuries-long ties to terrorism. And because of that decision, his relationship with our country and the world changed.\n\nSo, it's not about ami\u2014 or I apologize, I mean, it's not about impunity or giving a pass to those who sponsored terrorism in the past. It's about consequences for those who choose to continue supporting terrorism, and rewards for those who choose to renounce it."

We've made significant progress in Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime, but we're not naive about the challenges that remain. There's still a lot of work to be done, and we're working hard to complete the mission.\n\nI think it's unfair to characterize our message as, in any way, being less than straight with the American people. We've been clear about the risks and the challenges in Iraq, and we've been clear about our strategy for defeating the enemy and bringing stability to the region.\n\nI think the American people are smart enough to understand that we can't sugarcoat the situation, but we also know that we can't focus solely on the setbacks. We're making progress in training Iraqi forces, we're making progress on the security front, and we're making progress on the economic front.\n\nI'm confident that our strategy is the right one, and I'm confident that we'll succeed in bringing a stable, democratic Iraq to the region.

    "gen_response": "Good evening. Thank you for your question. Look, the energy bill is a comprehensive piece of legislation that includes significant measures to improve our nation's energy security, to increase our domestic production, and to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It's a tough bill, and it's not an easy fix for our current energy crisis. But it's a step in the right direction.\n\nThe bill, as you know, includes a number of key provisions, such as tax incentives for oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an increase in fuel efficiency standards, and support for renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. It also includes measures to suspend the federal gas tax for a limited time, which would give drivers a small break from these high prices.\n\nNow, I know some critics may say that the bill won't have an immediate impact on the current price of oil. And I understand their skepticism. But I strongly disagree with that assessment. (pausing for a moment) The truth is, the price of oil is a global market, and actions taken by the United States can have a ripple effect on the global price.\n\nIf this bill becomes law, it would send a signal to the oil producers and to the markets that the United States is committed to increasing its domestic production and reducing its reliance on foreign oil. That, in turn, can help to stabilize the global oil market and potentially put downward pressure on prices.\n\nIn addition, the bill would promote development of new sources of energy, like alternative fuels and more efficient vehicles, which can also help to reduce our consumption of oil in the long run.\n\nI'm not naive about the challenges facing our economy. Gas prices are still high today, and many Americans are feeling the pinch. But this energy bill is part of a broader effort to make America more energy independent, and it's an opportunity for us to take concrete steps to address the long-term challenges facing our economy."

I think what the Prime Minister was saying is that he, along with myself, had high hopes for the future of Iraq, for the Iraqi people, and for the development of a free and democratic society. And I believe that's shared by many of us who have been committed to the liberation of Iraq.\n\nNow, the wrangling and snarling and difficulties in Iraq are real. And I'll be the first to admit that the transfer of power to a stable, functioning government was not as smooth as we had anticipated. And that's a fair criticism.\n\nHowever, it's also fair to point out that we've made significant progress in many ways. We've got a government that's elected, we've got an economy that's emerging, and we've got Iraqis who are determined to live in a free society. Now, do we've got a ways to go? Absolutely. And I'm willing to acknowledge that, and we'll continue to make progress on it.\n\nBut to say that we miscalculated the pace at which the Iraqi government would be established, or that we had unrealistic expectations, is too simplistic an observation. The situation in Iraq is complex, with many different factors at play.\n\nNow, I believe our long-term strategy has been quite accurate, and I think it's shaping up to succeed. The new government, though challenged, has made progress in many areas, including oil production, infrastructure, and reconstruction. It's a difficult but crucial test of will and patience for Iraqis, for Americans, and for the international community. We will continue to work together to support the Iraqi people in achieving the peaceful future they deserve.\n\nI want to be clear, mistakes have been made, but that doesn't diminish the fundamental goals and purposes we have in the region.

The violence has intensified, and that's unacceptable. But let me tell you, our military is doing a superb job over there.\n\nGeneral Casey is doing a fine job as the new commander. His advice is valuable, and I'm relying on his expertise as we make decisions about the future of our operations in Iraq. And I can tell you, we're not going to be swayed by short-term headlines or daily press reports. We're focused on the long-term goal, and that's to help the Iraqi people build a stable, free, and democratic society.\n\nAs for being nimble and facile, we've had to adjust our tactics, no question about it. But the principle behind our strategy remains the same. We're continuing to work with the Iraqi government to build their security forces, and we're continuing to support those forces with additional troops and resources as needed.\n\nI would also say that in discussions with General Casey and our other military leaders, the attitude has been clear: we're not just fighting Al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations; we're fighting to give the Iraqi people a chance to build a better future for themselves. And that's what this is all about.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I believe we're being nimble and flexible in a way that's right for the mission.

    "gen_response": "Thank you, that's a good question. Since I'm the Commander-in-Chief, I'll give you a straightforward answer.\n\nFirstly, let's talk about what we've accomplished so far in Iraq. I want to remind you that our mission has not been an easy one. It's been a tough battle, and we've faced challenges that none of us could have foreseen at the time we launched Operation Iraqi Freedom. Despite those difficulties, we've made significant progress.\n\nWe successfully removed Saddam Hussein's regime, who had brutally oppressed his own people and was seeking to develop weapons of mass destruction. We've turned over power to an interim government, which has made significant steps in rooting out terrorist networks and establishing security in key regions of the country.\n\nWe've also given the Iraqi people the chance to vote in free and fair elections, which was a remarkable moment in the history of that country. That election was a testament to the resilience and courage of the Iraqi people. It shows that we've given them a sense of hope for a better future, despite the many obstacles and challenges we're still facing.\n\nNow, as we look to the future, our strategy is to continue working with our coalition partners, with the Iraqi security forces, to dismantle terrorist networks, to stabilize the region, and to help the Iraqi people build a secure and stable democracy. \n\nNow, I understand accusations that have been made about the effect of our military intervention. Those accusations are often rooted in criticisms that we've seen with regards to post-war planning. I will acknowledge that we have learned valuable lessons from the process as to what should have been done differently.\n\nHowever, I strongly disagree that our presence in Iraq has brought terrorism, essentially that bringing fuel to fire. That's a false and detached analysis, disconnected from what we're actually facing in Iraq.\n\nWhat the fact facts remain that The likes of Iran, al-Qaeda in the region and more resentful groups want because solutions to inflict suffering on humanity generally in the region are directly involved in the bloodshed and murder in response to military intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nBut make no mistake, my resolve is unwavering. I will take all the decisions necessary to ensure the safety and security of America and our allies. We must remain strong, firm and committed to fighting terrorism, and winning the war on terror."

I'm committed to enforcing United Nations Security Council resolutions. Saddam Hussein must disarm, or he'll face the consequences.\n\nNow I want to be clear: the goal of U.S. policy towards Iraq is to engage Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi people in a serious disarmament process. The goal is to assure that Iraq doesn't get W.M.D.s, period. If the diplomatic effort with the United Nations comes up short, if the inspections don't work, the United States will act to ensure that this guy, Saddam Hussein, can't threaten the free world.

Their recommendation will be based on the best available intelligence and on-the-ground assessments. I trust their professional expertise and decision-making.\n\nFrom my perspective as Commander-in-Chief, the focus remains on completing our mission, ensuring the safety of our troops, and maintaining a secure and stable environment in Iraq.

I spoke with Prime Minister Tony Blair, and he agrees with me, we have reason to believe that there is evidence that the Chinese may be involved in aiding Saddam Hussein's military.\n\nNow, if it is proven that the Chinese are providing assistance to Iraq, of course, there will be serious consequences. As I've said, we are willing to send a clear message to the Chinese that their actions will not be tolerated. And let me say, this is not just a bilateral issue between the United States and China; this is part of a broader effort to contain and disarm Saddam Hussein and his regime.\n\nWe're considering a range of options, including diplomatic, economic, and potentially military action. We want to make it clear to the Chinese Government that we will not engage in any activities that would benefit Saddam Hussein's regime at the expense of the Iraqi people. We will take specific steps, if necessary, to protect our national interests and the interests of our allies.\n\nNow, let me be clear: we are not looking for confrontation with China, but we cannot and will not let this issue go unchallenged.

We're not going to speculate on which countries might need our help, but we'll act when the situation calls for it.\n\nYou know, I've always said that our coalition is strong and fierce, and when we find terrorists hiding in a country that harbors or aids or supports terrorist activity, we'll do what's necessary to protect the American people and our interests. I'm not speculating on any specific country at this time, but we'll take all necessary actions to assure our nation's safety.\n\n(pauses for emphasis) \nLet me be clear, my main focus is to protect America, and I'll do everything in my power to keep the American people safe. And if that requires taking action in any country that would aid, abet, or harbor terrorism, I will take that action to protect our nation."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question. I appreciate it. Well, first of all, let me say that I've got some concerns with the legislation, and I've made those concerns clear. While I believe the bill's intentions are sound, I still have some reservations about its impact on free speech and the ability of American citizens to participate in politics.\n\nAs you know, I've vetoed campaign finance legislation before, and while this bill is different, I still have some concerns about how it will be interpreted and implemented. I'm reviewing it carefully, and we're working with Congress to make sure that any final bill does not impinge on the rights of citizens to voice their opinions and participate in the democratic process.\n\nAs for the impact on our political system, I believe it's essential that we strike a balance between regulating the influence of money in politics and protecting the rights of American citizens to participate in the electoral process. The bill's intention is to reduce the role of special interest money in politics, but I also want to make sure that we don't inadvertently stifle the voices of ordinary citizens.\n\nRegarding the pending legal challenge, I believe the courts will have a critical role to play in upholding the Constitution and ensuring that this legislation does not undue damage to our democracy. I'm still reviewing the bill, and I await the court's guidance on how it will be interpreted. Until then, I'll make my decision with the best interests of the American people in mind."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you - I'm glad you asked that question. I appreciate the opportunity to respond. \n\nNow, on the point of linkage, I understand the skepticism that exists out there. And I understand that some people in Europe are questioning whether there's a separate link between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaida. I would just say that the lack of direct evidence doesn't necessarily prove there isn't a link. I would point out that both Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden have a shared view of the world, a shared hatred for America, and it's well-documented that Saddam has had ties with various terrorist organizations over the years.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that there's a direct connection with 9/11. But I am saying that Saddam Hussein is a dangerous man who has used terror as a tool of his regime for decades. He's a man who has gassed his own people, who has used chemical and biological weapons, and has a program to develop nuclear weapons.\n\nSo, while I understand the skepticism about linkage, I think it's a case of viewing this through the prism of what we know about Saddam Hussein's past behavior. And when we consider his history, his capabilities, and the threat he poses to the region and to the United States, I believe that we have to be prepared to take action to protect our interests and the world from the threat that he poses.\n\nI'm not saying that we must necessarily link him directly to Al Qaida to justify our actions. But we do know that he's a keeper of loose nukes, and that's a danger. And we do know that his history of using terror and promoting terror makes him a threat to our national security. So, I'd say that we should be cautious not to read too much into the question of linkage, and focus on the evidence we have about Saddam Hussein's regime and its dangers."

    "gen_response": "The nomination of Bernard Kerik. Well, I think it's fair to say that I've reflected on that situation, and I've learned some lessons. First and foremost, it's my responsibility as the President to make sure that the people I appoint are fit for duty. And in this case, I relied on the recommendation of Rudy Giuliani, who knew Mr. Kerik, and I should have done a more thorough vetting process.\n\nNow, as I look to the future, I want to make sure that we've got a Director of Homeland Security and a Director of National Intelligence who are going to be able to lead these critical agencies effectively. And let me be clear: they're going to have to have two qualities that I'm looking for above all others.\n\nFirst, they've got to have a deep understanding of the threats we face, and they've got to have the expertise to address them. I'm talking about someone who's got a proven track record, who's got a grasp of the intelligence world, and who can drive these agencies forward in a way that makes Americans safer.\n\nSecond, they've got to have the integrity to lead. I'm talking about someone who's got character, who's going to make tough decisions, and who's going to make those decisions based on the facts, not based on personal agendas or politics.\n\nNow, in terms of the vetting process, I made a commitment to the American people to do it right this time around. We're going to do a thorough background check, and we're going to make sure that we're vetting these candidates more carefully than ever before.\n\nAs for the DNI, I want someone who's a seasoned intelligence expert, someone who's got a deep understanding of the intelligence community, and someone who's got the ability to bring together the various agencies under their purview to better protect America. This is a critical position, and I'm going to take my time to make sure we get the right person in that job.\n\nI'm confident that by the time I'm done, we'll have two leaders in place who are going to make America safer, and I'll be able to tell the American people that I've made the right choice. That's the lesson I've learned from the Kerik nomination, and that's the approach I'm taking now."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for asking. I think that's a fair question. I strongly disagree with the notion that Democrats are opposing my judicial nominees simply because they're of faith. In fact, I believe many of my opponents are motivated by a desire to advance a liberal agenda that is at odds with my values and the values of many Americans.\n\nBut I do think that faith is playing an increasingly significant role in our nation's politics. And I think that's a positive trend, in the sense that faith is a source of strength and inspiration for many Americans. I've spoken many times about the importance of faith in my life, and I believe it's something that brings us all together, as Americans.\n\nHowever, I also think it's getting used, in some cases, as a tool to marginalize, to attack, and to label people. I know some folks in this town might not agree with me, but I believe that a person's faith is a deeply personal decision, and it's not up for public debate. What matters is whether the nominee has a commitment to the law, rather than a commitment to a particular creed.\n\nAnd as for Congressional obstruction, I'm disappointed that many of the Democrats, even some of their stalwarts, have said that they oppose these nominees simply because of their faith. I think the Senate has a constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on my judicial nominations. We've nominated good people, men and women with impeccable credentials and a deep commitment to the law. They deserve a fair shot at being vetted and confirmed, and I hope that the Senate will move forward with that process, rather than playing politics with people's faith."

    "gen_response": "My fellow American, I appreciate your question and your passion for this important issue. As you know, the pain of Hurricane Katrina is still fresh in the hearts and minds of the people of the Gulf Coast. And as a nation, we must learn from it. And we must not just rebuild, we must rebuild with a commitment to compassion and inclusion.\n\nFirst and foremost, we are working tirelessly to provide aid and assistance to those who have been affected by the storm. The federal government has committed billions of dollars to the relief efforts, and we will continue to work to make sure that every single American who has been touched by this disaster has access to the resources they need to recover and rebuild.\n\nBut, as you said, we must do more than just provide economic help. We must also work to bridge the divide that has existed for far too long in this country. And I firmly believe that this is a moral imperative.\n\nAs you know, I have made it a priority of my administration to improve education, to expand access to healthcare, and to support programs that help our most vulnerable citizens. We have increased funding for the Head Start program, which provides critical early childhood education to disadvantaged children. We have expanded the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which has provided health care to millions of low-income children. And we have increased funding for historically black colleges and universities, hoping to provide more opportunities for African American students to succeed.\n\nNow, I know that these are steps in the right direction, but I also know that we have much more work to do. And that's why I'm committed to continuing to work with members of both parties to find common ground and to make progress on the issues that matter most to low-income and minority communities.\n\nRegarding the comments made by Secretary Bennett, I want to be clear: those comments were unacceptable. They were hurtful and divisive, and I told Secretary Bennett that himself. As a nation, we must focus on what unites us, not what divides us.\n\nNow, as for the Republican Party, I believe that we have a great opportunity to expand our appeal to African American voters. We must show them that our values of freedom, opportunity, and personal responsibility can benefit all Americans, regardless of the color of their skin. We must continue to promote compassion and kindness, and we must speak to the concerns that are specific to the African American community.\n\nMy advisor, Mr. Condoleezza Rice, has worked tirelessly to build relationships within the African American community. And I'm proud to say that we've made significant strides in engaging with African American voters and providing them with the opportunities they deserve.\n\nBut, I must tell you, my fellow American, this is not just a problem for the Republican Party. It's a problem for all of us. We must come together as one people, with shared values and a shared commitment to justice and equality. And I believe that if we do that, we can build a brighter future for all Americans, regardless of the color of their skin.\n\nThank you."

That's in line with our goals and that would let us reduce some of the troops that we have there, reaching 100,000 by the end of the year.\n\nMake no mistake that the we have fought hard and through a nine-year effort we've been able to make great progress as they have gained security control.

You know, I did campaign on a platform of increasing alternative energy and reducing our reliance on foreign oil, and I'm committed to that. However, I also made a commitment to the American people to make responsible decisions on the economic front.\n\nNow, I understand concerns about gas prices, and I've got concerns about 'em myself. But I've also got to consider the impact of quick fixes versus long-term solutions. Our goal is not just to stabilize the price of gas today, but to make sure we're setting America up for energy independence tomorrow.\n\nRegarding the State of the Union address, I think you'll find that I called for a comprehensive energy policy that includes a reduction in our dependence on foreign oil, an increase in domestic production, and a boost to alternative energy sources. And I'm pleased to report that we've made some progress on those fronts.\n\nJust because some polls might not be where we'd like them to be doesn't mean we're not working hard on this issue. I'm happy to listen to the American people, but I also believe we need to take a thoughtful, methodical approach to solving our energy challenges.\n\nNow, an emergency energy summit, while I appreciate the idea, might be a bit... overwrought. (pauses) We've been working closely with key leaders in both parties, and we've made progress on some of these issues. What I'd say is, we need the Congress to work with me, and we need to pass some critical legislation that will help us get moving on this.\n\nMy answer remains what it's been, we're making progress, we're working hard, and we'll keep moving forward. Gas prices, I understand, are a big issue for the American people, and I'll continue to push for solutions that will make a difference."

I had the opportunity to get to know Mayor Daley during my visit last summer, and at that time, I was intrigued by his energy and dedication to his city. I was impressed with the progress he's made in Chicago, his commitment to education, infrastructure, and economic development. But I'll tell you this - no one is above the law, and if allegations of wrongdoing have been found to be true, that's very troubling.\n\nAs I always say, the American people have a right to honest, accountable government, and corruption in any form - whether it's in Washington or in Chicago - will not be tolerated. I think the actions taken by U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald are a testament to the commitment of our justice system to uncovering corruption and upholding the rule of law.\n\nNow, as for my personal assessment of Mayor Daley, I'll reserve judgment until more information is known about the allegations and what steps he's taking to correct any problems within his administration. I do want to emphasize my appreciation for the positive contributions he's made to his city, but let me be clear: if corruption is found, it will have consequences.\n\nWe'll be monitoring the situation closely and seeing how it unfolds. And I'm confident that our justice system will be thorough and transparent in its investigation.\n\nAnd now, next question."

We got a lot of businesses in America that are investing in new technology, but we also got a lot of folks that need to update their skills to be able to do the work. So what we're going to do is provide federal support to help workers get the training they need. We're going to work with the private sector to make sure that we're helping them. We're going to create more job training programs. And by the way, it's not just just about training folks that already have a job, it's also for folks that don't have a job yet, so they can get one. We got to be able to make sure that the American worker is at least as competitive with the global economy as we can be.\n\nNow, regarding tax breaks, I agree with you that the cost of the war is significant. However, I also believe it's our duty to keep our economy strong, so it can create jobs, so it can keep our country safe. And tax breaks can help us do that.  We already passed the Jobs and Growth package last year. That's why we're seeing a strong economy right now. Now we're going to continue with the wise and targeted tax breaks that we believe will help small business owners like you're speaking about. We're talking about eliminating some the regulations that are stifling small businesses. For example, some businesses can't even get approval from regulatory agencies fast enough to make the money they need to grow and then they can't hire as many people. China is not limited by those regulations. We got to make sure that we level that playing field."

I know Alan Greenspan, we had good times, bad times. I appreciate the contributions he made as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. But, as you know, we disagreed on several key issues, not the least of which was the suitability of tax cuts during a period of economic growth.\n\nAs for whether I feel betrayed by those who have served in my administration and then spoken out against me, I don't feel that way at all. After all, we hired them to give us their honest opinions, and I valued their honest opinions when they were working for me. Now that they're not, I respect their right to speak out and share their perspectives. It's always interesting to hear from people who have been close to the inner workings of the White House.\n\nNow, regarding Alan Greenspan's book, I'd say that I have some differences with his conclusions. I think he's being a bit disingenuous in suggesting that our tax cuts were that fiscally reckless. What I did was respond to a surplus the economy had been experiencing for many years, and to give Americans relief from those taxes. It was also worth noting that our long-term projections showed continued surpluses into the 21st century.\n\n(After a short pause)\n\nI would say that Greenspan's amnesia about the economic conditions of the time is a bit frustrating. During my administration, an opponent of mine, Senator Kerry, claimed that taxes were too low, and Greenspan actually agreed with Senator Kerry that taxes needed to go up. There was bipartisan agreement on that. I think it's a bit rich for Greenspan to say today that our policies caused a crisis."

Our troops have done a magnificent job, working with the Iraqi forces to root out terrorist and insurgent forces.

You see, Martha, I've said many times that we're not measuring our success by some arbitrary timeline or some retrofitted notion of what a \"victory\" looks like. We're measuring our success by whether Al Qaida's ability to operate, to plan, to carry out attacks, is diminished. And I can tell you, that's exactly what we've seen.\n\nHowever, defining victory in this regard can be nuanced. And bottom line view, the violence has increased recently, and include terrorist strikes like the bombing yesterday in Hillah. It looks like we still have a lot of work to do to secure the peace.\n\nBut, by degree of raw violence in battlefield since the heights of sectarian violence over the past few years, we've asked much progress.

But I concur with you that not only are we looking at new technologies and renewable energies to supplement our traditional energy sources, we've also been actively pursuing these initiatives.\n\nIn fact, I've increased funding for a number of programs that invest in renewable energy, particularly in solar, wind, biofuels, and hydrogen. And we've made significant investments in fuel efficiency and in alternative energies, incentives for the development of new technologies, including tax credits for homeowners who put solar panels on their roofs, research and development funds for -- all these areas.\n\nNow, I agree there's a question whether we've passed or are approaching the point of maximum oil pumping capability. I don't want to get into all the experts' details, but yes, there's a concern out there that that may be the case. But we're taking thoughtful and comprehensive approach to address this challenge. We need to keep our economy growing; we need to keep our economy strong. America is addicted to oil, and we need to reduce our reliance on foreign imports. And we've made significant progress on that front as well.\n\nNow, I'd just say, you can't just snap your fingers and suddenly have alternative energy become the majority of our energy mix. That's not how it works. We've made progress, but it's a long-term effort, and we're going to continue to invest in those initiatives, and it's going to pay off over the long term. Thank you."

You're right that North Korea is no longer on the list of global state sponsors of terrorism; in fact, North Korea's nuclear program is a significant concern. Iraq, of course, was toppled as a result of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\nAs for Iran, while they withdrew from the peaceful role of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, they are still a critical concern. I believe they develop nuclear weapons because they aim to protect their ability to spread terrorism in the region, and they are hostile to the very price and wavelengths of democracy.\n\nWhat is left, is another question that could be asked for what could be the urgent greatest threat when it comes to security for President Obama.\n\nHowever, if I were to give President Obama\u2019s most pressing challenge simply based on my experience, it would be the conventional threat posed by Iranian availability of terrorism spread beyond confessional capabilities and promoted major strategic threats to us and international peace in the Middle East."

First, as Governor of Texas, I did indeed sign 152 death warrants, but I want to make it clear that this situation with Timothy McVeigh is unique. The evidence against him is overwhelming. There's no question in my mind, or in the minds of our law enforcement officials, or in the minds of the American people, that Timothy McVeigh was responsible for the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma City.\n\nNow, as for Director Freeh and his resignation, I am aware that he's stepping down as Director of the FBI, and I must say, it's a decision that I respect. As for whether he knew about these documents or not, I would have to defer that to the Attorney General's office and the FBI for further clarification on that matter. I'm not aware of any direct knowledge Director Freeh had about these particular documents, but I'll have my people check into it and provide a more detailed answer."

    "gen_response": "(smiling) Well, thank you for that question. I'm glad to share some of my thoughts on this matter. Yesterday, as I was walking into the Oval Office, I did have a chance to speak with my father, and I told him how I appreciated his viewing of my inauguration. He, as you know, was not able to be there in person, but he did send a generous letter that I read earlier in the day.\n\n(pauses, looking around the room)\n\nAs for the conversation itself, it was quite candid, as usual. He wasn't too subtle with his words, and I appreciated that. He had some advice on how to handle the challenges that we face, and some cautions on the country's position in the world, which I always find helpful coming from him. We respect each other's perspectives, and I'm grateful for that opportunity to solicit his input.\n\n-regarding the second term-\n\nIn this second term, I'd say that yes, there are chances for me to take more calculated risks, make some choices that might have been viewed as less popular during the heat of a campaign, or perhaps hadn't been as palatable given the circumstances of the time. Make no mistake, though, every decision I make will still have to balance competing priorities and will have to be sound in accordance with the constitution and the best interests of this great country.\n\nI don't want to pretend I don't feel a certain... libertarian inclinations on certain domestic issues."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, Bob, that's a fine question. I appreciate your insight into the nature of bipartisanship. I believe that bipartisanship is not just about picking off a few Democrats on a case-by-case basis. Bipartisanship, to me, means working in a spirit of mutual respect, in a spirit of trust, to find common ground that benefits the American people.\n\nNow, I understand that we're a nation with two different parties with different perspectives and different visions for our country. And it's the duty of the White House to find those areas where we can agree and work towards those agreements in a bipartisan manner.\n\nNow, certainly, there have been several instances where I have reached across the aisle and worked with Democrats to get certain pieces of legislation passed. The No Child Left Behind Act, the Department of Energy bill, these are examples of times when we worked together.\n\nHowever, I'd like to clarify that my commitment to bipartisanship is even broader than that. I envision a relationship with the Democrats, a relationship where we, the Republicans, the Democrats, and the independents, can come together to tackle these big, daunting issues facing our country, whether it's energy policy, education reform, healthcare, or tax policy.\n\nWe're not just going to get along because we have to exercise power; we're going to work together because it's the right thing to do for the American people. And so, I think that when we achieve that, when we achieve that kind of spirit of bipartisanship, that's when we will make real and meaningful progress for this country.\n\nNow, I'm willing to work with Senator Daschle, Senator Daschle and Senator Gephardt, I'm willing to work with Majority Leader Reid if that's what's required. I believe that's what leadership is about. I believe it's not just about our party's interests; it's about the American people's interests.\n\nSo to answer your question, it's not just about picking off a few Democrats; it's about working with them regularly, working with them to find common ground, and I believe that's what this country needs, and that's what I'm committed to do. Thank you."

I've been in politics a long time, I've dealt with my share of security issues, but the bottom line is that we're working closely with our Chilean hosts to ensure a safe and respectful visit.\n\nAs for the dinner in Santiago, I've been briefed on the situation. Apparently, the Chileans felt that our security protocols were too extensive and might have been perceived as a threat to the local community. I appreciate the concerns of the Chilean government, and I assured President Lagos that our security measures are in place to protect American lives and property, not to inconvenience our friends or partners.\n\nAs for the incident involving my security man, I've been told that it was a situation that required our people to respond quickly and decisively. I'm proud of the way our agents handled it, and we'll continue to work with them to ensure that our team can do their job effectively while showing respect for the local authorities and the community.\n\nThe key is to strike a balance between security and diplomacy. We're committed to working with our partners around the world to achieve our common goals, and I'm confident that we'll be able to find a solution that meets both our needs and those of our hosts.\n\nI appreciate the question, thank you."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you. As for the first question regarding Iran's nuclear program, we believe that Iran should not have a nuclear power program at all, at least not at this point in time. We are deeply concerned about the possibility of Iran developing nuclear weapons, and we're committed to working with the international community to prevent that from happening.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council resolution that was passed recently, which calls on Iran to suspend its enrichment of uranium, we believe is an essential step towards addressing this issue. And we will work with our allies and partners to ensure that Iran adheres to this resolution.\n\nNow, regarding any potential parameters for a nuclear program that we would be willing to accept from the Iranians, we will be guided by the principle of \u201cno enrichment.\u201d We don't see a role for Iran to enrich uranium domestically. Any nuclear power program in Iran would need to be subject to robust international inspections and would require transparency and accountability.\n\nNow, as for the second part of your question, about supporting the Iranian people, I have indeed said that the United States supports the Iranian people and our goal is to see a democratic Iran. We believe that the people of Iran deserve the same freedoms we enjoy here in the United States, including the freedom to choose their own leaders and live in a country that is respectful of human rights.\n\nAs for expediting legislation or sending resources to groups in Iran that might hasten regime change or democratic reform, I can tell you that the United States is committed to supporting the Iranian people. We have engaged with various dissident groups and have provided humanitarian assistance to the Iranian people.\n\nWe also believe that the responsibility for change in Iran lies with the Iranian people themselves. We will not dictate how that change should occur. However, I can tell you that we will continue to support democratic movements and organizations around the world that promote freedom and human rights.\n\nIn terms of specific legislation or resources, I will leave those kinds of details to the Secretary of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development. But rest assured, Mr. President, that we will continue to support any effort that supports the aspirations of the Iranian people for a better life, for greater freedom, and for democracy."

With respect to the question of the leak involving Valerie Plame, we've tried to get to the facts and the bottom of it, and the Department of Justice has investigated the matter thoroughly. And as I've said before, we've cooperated fully with the investigators.\n\nWith regard to Karl Rove's involvement, I can tell you that Karl has acknowledged discussing the matter with reporters, but he has not confirmed the identity of the Valerie Plame. And the Department of Justice, as I mentioned, has looked into the matter, and they've not found evidence of a crime.\n\nNow, I'll say this: I'm proud of the standards we've set in this administration. We're committed to integrity and transparency. And where mistakes have been made, we've acknowledged them and taken action. With regard to Scott McClellan, he and I have had a difference of opinion on this matter, but I respect his thoughts and his service. And I'm certain that Karl Rove acted within the proprieties of his duties at the time, even if we might regret the manner in which the conversation unfolded.\n\nBut I'll also say this: our administration has acted to ensure that the leakers have been identified and the federal agency responsible for protecting classified information has tightened up procedures. That's consistent with the principles we agreed on at the beginning of our administration."

Alright, so you got 4 questions.\n\nSo, first, on the multinational force I believe it should take the shape of a force that is led by the Lebanese government with international support, meaning troops coming from other countries to assist in the training and in helping to secure the country in the south where Hizballah respected the border. The Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon has already spoken and actualized several things. Military and economic aid, economies of training would be one color type welfare for certain that is proceeded through the sovereignty of power by the Lebanese government.\n\nI believe a United Nations peace-keeping force with Lebanon on board and with an international presence generally within Lebanon to support Lebanon's sovereignty in the southern border would be correct. Another item for the central option safety aspect was by really adding more fire upon Israeli needed aid of to these states."

It's not popularity contests, it's based on the facts.\n\nLet me make one thing clear: Saddam Hussein was a threat to the United States, to America's security, and to the peace in the world.  He had a history of supporting terrorism, he had been developing weapons of mass destruction and the international community had given him numerous opportunities to disarm, which he chose not to do.  We had no choice, but to take decisive action.\n\nThe war in Iraq is not just about removing a dictator, it's about creating an opportunity for a free and democratic Iraq to arise.  It's about getting rid of a Hussein regime that persecuted its' own people, that was moreover withholding important opportunities that really needed and deserved to be taken advantage of.\n\nIt's going to take time to resolve the situation in Iraq, and there will be tough times ahead.  We're making tough decisions now and will continue to do so. With the help of the Iraqi people, we can secure the future for a safer and more peaceful world.\n\nI expect public support, like many things we undertake, will continue to go through ups and downs.

James Baker is a valued friend and a trusted advisor, and I have a great deal of respect for him. However, as President, I've got to consider all the input and all the advice that I'm getting from the various agencies, including the Pentagon, the State Department, and the CIA.\n\nNow, I think the Baker-Hamilton report does offer some good ideas and some thoughtful recommendations, but it's just one of the many opinions that I'm considering. And I've got to weigh all the information, all the advice, and all the input that I'm getting from my team before making any decisions about our strategy in Iraq.\n\nNow, I know that some folks might think that, given James Baker's connection to my family, this report carries more weight. And I appreciate that concern. But I've always tried to make decisions based on the best interests of the country, not based on personal relationships or favors. So, I'll be considering the Baker-Hamilton report, but I'll also be considering the other input I'm getting, and I'll be making a decision based on what I think is best for the United States of America.\n\nAnd I might add, I'm a decision-maker, not a dilettante. I've got to make the tough calls, and I've got to make them based on the best available information, not based on who the report came from.

I'm confident that the American people want us to finish the job in Iraq, to combat terrorism, to make the region more peaceful.\n\nNow, as for the election, I'm not worried about the debate period. I'm concerned about the war itself. I believe the American people know the stakes, and they know I did what I thought was right to take out Saddam Hussein and to liberate the Iraqi people. And for those who are new to the debate, Secretary Rumsfeld and Secretary Rice and others are available to brief candidates.\n\nHowever, I must say that I believe, from my administration, we've given the most accurate information we have. If any candidate wants to know the more exact information, I'd be happy to have them ask their people at the Pentagon, at the State Department. We'll give them as clear an understanding as we can give them, because the stakes are high, and I believe the American people are ready for those of us to succeed in Iraq."

Now, I understand that there have been difficulties in the past with immigration reform, but we've made significant progress. Many Mexicans, and I mean, many undocumented workers who have made their way to our great nation, have done so out of a desire for a better life for themselves and their families.\n\nNow, as for why Mexicans would believe we're serious about immigration reform now, I believe it's because we have made a commitment to reform this broken system. Our Attorney General, Michael Mukasey, and our Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, have been working closely with the Mexican government to ensure that we're doing this in a way that's fair and that it takes into account the concerns of all parties involved.\n\nRegarding our chances of coming through with this bill in Congress, we're facing some obstacles, there's no doubt about it. We have a number of differing opinions on Capitol Hill. But I remain optimistic. I've met with both Republicans and Democrats, and I believe there's a will to get this done.

Thank you very much. \n\nYou know, I'm deeply concerned about the developments in Iran with regards to nuclear enrichment and their detention of three American citizens. This behavior is unacceptable and is of great concern to the entire international community.\n\nOn Iran's nuclear enrichment program, the International Atomic Energy Agency's report is a reminder of the perceived pace of the Iranian nuclear program. The international community has been warning the Iranians to cease their enrichment efforts. Now we're at a point where Iran continues to march down a road towards nuclear capability, and we must take a united and decisive stand.\n\nRegarding potential U.N. sanctions, I think it's essential that we apply pressure on Iran through all diplomatic channels. I believe in using tough, smart sanctions, which have teeth. It's a proven tool in the past that it can bring countries to the negotiating table.\n\nNow, international pressure requires coordination among major powers. I have spoken to Russia and China on this matter repeatedly. From my perspective, I believe both countries understand we share a common concern: the prevention of any nuclear proliferation. I am optimistic that they'll join us in taking a strong stance against Iran's nuclear ambitions.\n\nIn the following days, the Ramsfield-Emh personalities from united nations and major powers concerns must come together to address the matter with force and a majority coalition."

Now, I know there's been some confusion about this connection, but let me be as clear as I can be.\n\nSaddam Hussein had ties to Al Qaida not just through Al Qaida in Iraq, but through his interactions with Abu Musab Al Zarqawi. Most of you are aware who that individual is. He was the founder of Al Qaida in Iraq, and it's well-documented that he was working very closely with Saddam's government.\n\nIn terms of evidence, I'd like to point to the connections we discovered in Iraq after our military operation. We found documents, radio communications, intelligence reports, all of which show that Saddam Hussein and his government were providing support to terrorists.\n\nFor example, the captured Al Qaida in Iraq documents show that they received guidance and financial support from the Saddam regime. This guidance included support and planning for the successful conduct of operations against Coalition forces and Iraqi civilians.\n\nFurthermore, multiple captured senior Saddam regime officials have identified contacts at the highest levels of Saddam's government with Al Qaida in Iraq, including Mr. Zarqawi, the founder.\n\nWe have the statements of individuals, including the, now deposed, Deputy Secretary of the Iraqi Defense Ministry, and the Director of the Iraqi Intelligence Service, Link will confirm their intelligence interaction directly with Al Qaida in Iraq."

However, I am open to a reasonable increase in the gasoline tax, not just forClosure, but with the proper guidance. I would want to see an exhaustive analysis of the proposal, and it would need to be coupled with transparency and accountability measures to ensure that the increased revenue is being used efficiently and effectively.\n\nA 5 cent or more increase is under consideration, but I would not be willing to support it without a comprehensive plan for allocating the additional funds, one that promotes transparency and results-driven management.

However, the implementation of the visa requirements is an ongoing process.\n\nWe are talking about establishing Romania's integration into the Visa Waiver Program status, and it is high on our agenda. However, to firmly determine an exact time when Romanian citizens can visit the United States without a visa, we as well as the Romanian government have to resolve any outstanding concerns.\n\nAfter the 2004 Romanian Presidential and parliamentary elections, our department in the states as well as your Romanian government looked into this with real careful concern. Without delaying or underestimating the remarkable progress into foreign policy ties and prospective deals between United States and Romania, currently Romania enjoys non-visa entry status and I believe it offers a great deal of progress.\n\nTo the Romanian people, and to those interested in our very unbiased discussion in foreign policy, I pledge to continue working closely with our Romanian counterparts to answer all concerns  Romanian citizens may have, and to ultimately consider to get them the visa waiver program status either quickly or if nothing else as soon as it is possible.\n\nHowever, Romania must allay outstanding concerns including citations and long logtime revisions  -such capabilities soon if or recently than when addressed."

The transfer of sovereignty in Iraq and the questions regarding our future relationship with the Iraqi government are significant. As you know, the United States has a commitment to assist the Iraqi people in building their new democracy, and that includes transferring responsibility for the detained leaders of the former regime, including Saddam Hussein.\n\nRegarding the custody of Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi government has expressed its desire to take custody of him when sovereignty is transferred. We're considering their request, but it's a serious decision. We will weigh carefully the implications of such a transfer, taking into account the need to ensure justice for the victims of Saddam's regime, as well as the need to ensure that those who are responsible for crimes against humanity do not escape accountability. We will make a decision that prioritizes the interests of the Iraqi people and the pursuit of justice, and I expect our diplomatic teams to be in close communication with the Iraqi government on this matter.\n\nNow, as for your second question regarding President Karzai, we are working closely with the new government of Afghanistan in their efforts to bring to justice those responsible for the terrorist attacks of September 11th. This includes Usama bin Laden and his network. While President Karzai has not specifically stated who will try these individuals, it's clear that he understands the importance of bringing them to justice.\n\nWe will continue to work with the Afghan government to support their efforts to build a just and stable society. This includes assistance in building the capacity of the Afghan justice system, including providing training and technical assistance to help them build a fair and effective judicial system that can address the crimes committed by the Taliban and al-Qaeda.

As the President of the United States, I've had the privilege of dealing with China on a number of issues, and I'll give you my thoughts on this.\n\nFirst, we have to recognize the important economic relationship we have with China. It's true that they finance a significant portion of our trade deficit, but we also have to acknowledge that they're an emerging superpower, and we're eager to engage in a constructive dialogue with them on trade issues. My administration has been working hard to crack down on unfair trade practices and protect American jobs.\n\nNow, on the issue of human rights and religious minorities, we are clear-eyed about China's record in these areas. We've spoken out against China's human rights abuses, including the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners, Christians, and Tibetans. We're committed to promoting freedom, democracy, and human rights around the world, and we'll continue to do so with China.\n\nNow, as for how Americans should think about China, I don't think it's helpful to categorize them simply as an ally, a rival, or a competitor. The relationship with China is complex, and we need to have a nuanced view of it. We need to be realistic about their capabilities and their intentions, but we also have to recognize that we have a common interest in areas like nonproliferation, counter-terrorism, and global economic stability.\n\nThe United States and China have a lot to offer each other, from trade to education to culture. But we also have some fundamental differences in our values and our systems of government. And we need to make sure that as we engage with China, we're doing so in a way that protects American interests and promotes American values.\n\nSo, I'd say that our approach should be one of engagement, but also one of clarity. We'll engage China on areas of mutual interest, but we'll also speak out when we disagree on human rights and other issues. We'll work to promote a balance in our relationship that advances American interests, while also contributing to peace, stability, and prosperity in the region."

I understand that there are legitimate concerns about the balance between privacy and security, and I believe Congress is grappling with that every day.\n\nAs for modification or new laws, I... \n\n(clears throat)\n\nI have made it clear that I believe the authority we have, as granted by the FISA statute, enables us to engage in these necessary counter-terrorism activities. However, if there's a way we can provide further clarity, further definitions, to reassure the American people that we're not overstepping our bounds, then I'm more than happy to work with Congress to get that done.\n\nThe key issue here is keeping America safe. And we cannot do that if we're tied down by bureaucratic red tape and uncoordinated procedures. My team and I, we're committed to doing this the right way, but we're also committed to doing this in a way that includes oversight and accountability.\n\nNow, I believe a new law, or at least the redefinition of the FISA law, can provide that added layer of comfort to the American people. But it's not just about the principle; it's about practicality. I want to make sure that the NSA can do their work effectively without the necessity for Congress to flag potential targets to them every single time. That would hinder their ability, their effectiveness.\n\nAnd, let me re-iterate, I hold the highest regard for civil liberties, and the importance to safeguard those liberties. What I don't want to see is the American people feeling that their rights as citizens are being compromised in a way that's not absolutely necessary.\n\nWe're going to work with Congress to reach a conclusion that supports our anti-terrorism efforts, yet also respects the civil liberties of our citizens."

We do acknowledge that North Korea's nuclear and missile programs are the greatest threat they pose to international stability and security.\n\nRegarding the six-party talks, we support the process, and we will continue to engage constructively in those talks when the circumstances are ripe for meaningful progress. The six-party talks offer a forum for the international community to address the complex issues surrounding North Korea's nuclear program, and we're committed to working with our partners in those talks to achieve a peaceful resolution.\n\nHowever, I also want to emphasize that we're not naive to the ways in which North Korea has sought to use the six-party talks as a way to delay and gain leverage, rather than engage in genuine negotiations. Our approach will continue to be to engage North Korea in direct talks, to challenge them on their actions, and to maintain strong adherence to our international commitments, including our non-proliferation obligations.\n\nRegarding the issue of money laundering, we've made great progress in cracking down on financial networks that support international terrorism and proliferation, and we will continue to tackle these networks. But to say that we're not addressing critical issues related to counter-terrorism would be a mischaracterization. We've been very clear in our efforts, and I hope that all nations will assist us in this fight.\n\nBut make no mistake, our priority is to prevent the spread of ballistic missiles that threaten our allies and our vital interests. We've been working intensively with our partners in Japan and South Korea to upgrade their missile defense capabilities, and we're committed to developing and deploying anti-ballistic missile systems to protect free nations from this threat.\n\nIn the end, our goal remains clear: to ensure the non-proliferation of nuclear and ballistic missile technologies, to prevent the spread of threat from North Korea, and to protect our nation and our friends from harm. We'll continue to work tirelessly to achieve these objectives. Thank you."

    "gen_response": "Good afternoon, folks. Thank you for the question. I appreciate it. Now, I must say, I'm a firm believer in the importance of Social Security. It's a time-honored program that has helped generations of Americans live more secure and fulfilling lives. But, as we all know, it's facing some challenges \u2013 demographic changes, and the need to modernize it to ensure its long-term solvency.\n\nNow, I've proposed a plan to reform Social Security, a plan that incorporates a voluntary, personal retirement account option, which would give workers a more personal stake in their own retirement savings, and access to higher returns on their investments. This approach has been mischaracterized by some as \"partial privatization,\" but let me be clear: it's not about undermining the universality of Social Security, or privatizing the program for all Americans. It's about giving workers a chance to supplement their benefits with personal accounts.\n\nRegarding bipartisanship, I am always open to working with both parties to find common ground. And I'm willing to listen to any suggestion that will strengthen Social Security and ensure its long-term viability. However, I remain committed to this plan, which includes personal retirement accounts as an option for workers who want it.\n\nNow, I want to emphasize again, this is about giving Americans more choices and more control over their own retirement savings. And it's about ensuring that future generations are guaranteed the safety net that we know today as Social Security. If there are other ideas on the Democratic side that can help achieve these goals, I'm willing to consider them. But I'm not just going to walk away from a plan that I believe helps ensure the long-term solvency of the program. And that's exactly that."

Now, let me tell you, I've read the Iraq Study Group Report, and I appreciate the Baker Commission's thoughts and recommendations. However, I've got to tell you, we've got a bit of a different situation on our hands in the Middle East today than we did during the Cold War. We're dealing with a lot of complex actors, a lot of very bad actors, folks who are sponsored by Iran, folks that are supported by Iran.\n\nNow, I agree with the concept of talking to adversaries, I really do. I mean, we've talked to some very bad people in the past - not this administration, but previous administrations - and we've gotten good results out of it. And I believe that's the case with North Korea. We've had some very tough negotiations with them, and we've had some success.\n\nBut, let me be clear, talking to Iran and Syria is a lot more complicated. I mean, Iran's got a nuclear program that's a threat to the world, a threat to Israel, and a threat to the United States of America. And Syria's got a history of supporting terrorist organizations, supporting violence in Lebanon, and helping to foment insurgency in Iraq.\n\nSo, while I appreciate the Baker Commission's advice, I just can't say that I'm ready to sit down with those two countries just yet. We need to make sure that there are some preconditions in place, that we're able to address these very serious issues, before we start having conversations.\n\nBut I do agree, in principle, that talking to adversaries can be valuable. We're already doing that in the Middle East, through our Palestinian dialogue with the Israelis and the Palestinians. And we'll continue to do that, as it makes sense, with a variety of countries, including Syria and Iran. But we've got to be careful, we've got to be smart, and we've got to be tough. We can't just talk to folks for the sake of talking to 'em. We've got to get some concrete results, so that we can make the world a safer place for the American people and our allies. Thank you."

I've instructed my team to be flexible and work with the Uruguay government to address their concerns.\n\nWe've made some progress in our discussions today, and I'm optimistic that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement in the near future.

We've worked closely with him since 9/11, and as you know, we've had our differences. But we believe it's essential to work with him, because his assistance is crucial in the pursuit of Al Qaida and other terrorist elements in Pakistan.\n\nRegarding the specific question of intelligence on top Al Qaida leaders, I'm not prepared at this time to comment on any specific intelligence we may have. However, I will tell you that -- (pausing for a moment) -- our policy is clear, and it's designed to ensure that those responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the ongoing threat they pose to our way of life are brought to justice. \n\nWe're in close consultation with the Pakistani government and other interested parties to ensure their cooperation in this effort. We have every expectation that Pakistan will continue to cooperate with us on this. We share a common goal: to rid the world of terrorists.\n\nRegarding President Karzai and our meeting with General Musharraf, the President's priority in this meeting will be to review the situation on the ground in Afghanistan and Pakistan and to discuss further ways that we and Pakistan can further cooperate on counter-terrorism efforts. I'll be accompanying President Karzai, and it's an opportunity for us to reaffirm our commitment to the success of the Afghan people and to furthering stability in the region.\n\nWe look forward to a productive discussion with President Karzai and General Musharraf, to explore ways we can work together to overcome the challenges facing this region.

    "gen_response": "Good morning. Thank you for asking that question. I appreciate the chance to share my thoughts on this matter. A lasting peace in the Middle East will require a leadership that is committed to non-violence and working towards a two-state solution. \n\nFirst and foremost, we believe that Israel has a right to defend itself against any terrorist attacks emanating from Gaza. I believe that President Abbas and the Palestinian Authority have a critical role to play in stopping those attacks and bringing about a lasting peace. \n\nOne of the steps that we believe is necessary is the disarmament of Hamas and other militant groups. We urge Prime Minister Abbas and his government to exert greater control over Gaza and crack down on terrorism. This is essential for any real progress towards negotiations and a peace agreement.\n\nUnfortunately, Hamas's continued aggression and terrorism has hampered efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution. We urge Hamas and other extremist groups to stop using violence as a means to achieve their objectives. \n\nWe're providing support to President Abbas and his government in their efforts to reform the Palestinian Authority and to strengthen their institutions. We think this is a necessary step towards creating a stable government that can effectively govern Gaza.\n\nIn our view, a credible and effective leadership in Gaza, led by President Abbas, is essential for any chance of peace. I believe the President, along with his government, must take concrete steps to combat terrorism and work towards reclaiming control of Gaza. \n\nWe are committed to supporting President Abbas's efforts in any way we can and we urge all parties to take responsibility in advancing towards a lasting peace in the region."

Now, when does it really sink in, I remind you that it's a matter of hours, days, and weeks rather than months. You see, this job, it's a tremendous honor, but it's a weighty burden.\n\nI think what Mr. Obama will feel the full impact of the pressure and isolation of this office, not unlike what I experienced, relatively soon after his inauguration. The moment the oath of office is taken, the expectations of the public, the scrutiny of the media, the international community's gaze upon him, it all starts from that moment onward. He will be thrust into this environment where every decision is magnified, where every word is parsed, and where the stakes are incredibly high.\n\nWhat I advised him and what other former Presidents who have spoken with him have surely shared is that this job changes you in unpredictable ways, even the President, they're not immune to those pressures. The bubble that you referred to is very real. It's a matter of finding a way to balance the demands of this office with your own personal life, your family, and your faith. That's a challenge many Presidents have faced, and I think Mr. Obama is well-aware of that.\n\nNow, I also wanted to let him know, I and my wife Laura, we reached out, we offered our support in any way we could, whether it be through counsel or just offering a listening ear.

And I'm sure our Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary Paul O'Neill, will have some additional comments to make.\n\nFirst of all, I want to say that a strong dollar is good for America. It's a reflection of our economic strength, it's a reflection of the confidence that the world has in the U.S. economy, and it's a reflection of the sound fiscal policies that we've put in place.\n\nNow, I understand that a strong dollar can have some negative impacts on certain sectors of our economy, particularly our exporters. And we're aware of that. But we're working very closely with our trade partners to try to address those concerns.\n\nAnd let me say, I've talked to President Chirac of France, and I've talked to President Putin, and we're all on the same page in terms of our desire to reduce barriers to trade, to increase economic cooperation, and to create more opportunities for business to grow and prosper.\n\nNow, as for President Putin's concerns, (turns to a nearby advisor for a glance) Ah, yes, Mr. Putin's concerns about the strong dollar, I'll speak to that. (turns back to the reporter) Russia, like the U.S., is affected by the value of the dollar, but I would say that President Putin is concerned about issues that go beyond just the value of the dollar. He's concerned about the global economic situation, he's concerned about the state of global trade, and he's concerned about the impact of terrorism on the global economy.\n\nHowever, in terms of the dollar's impact specifically, I think it's fair to say that a strong dollar can have some effects on Russia's economy, in terms of the price of commodities and the like. But I would say that Russia's economy is more diversified than some other countries, and they're capable of adapting to changes in the global economy.\n\n(pauses for a moment) Secretary O'Neill, do you have any additional comments?"

That's because, as you know, our efforts to combat terrorism have broadened beyond a single individual. We're focused on rooting out al-Qaeda and its affiliates in multiple regions, from the Middle East to Southeast Asia and even here at home. While bin Laden's impact on global terrorism is undeniable, our efforts to keep America safe require a broader approach.\n\nRegarding your question about his status, I can tell you that we continue to work tirelessly to gather intelligence on the al-Qaeda network. The United States government has not released any information that would confirm whether Usama bin Laden is alive or dead. I'm not at liberty to disclose any classified information that might compromise our ongoing operations.\n\nHowever, I can assure the American people that we are using every tool at our disposal to combat terrorism, and we're making progress. The global coalition has delivered significant blows to al-Qaeda and its affiliates, and we're not finished yet. While the threat posed by terror groups like al-Qaeda remains real, I am confident in the resilience and determination of the American people and our military.\n\n(pauses, leaning forward)\n\nAnd, Larry, I appreciate your question. I want to emphasize that every American should know that as long as al-Qaeda and its affiliates continue to plot and scheme, we will be vigilant and take action to protect our nation.

However, let me be clear: our intentions remain committed to giving Saddam Hussein the opportunity to comply with UN Security Council resolutions, but if he continues to fail to do so, we have a responsibility to the international community and to our own national security to act.\n\nI must add, though, that this is a process.

First of all, the attacks on our troops and the coalition forces are unacceptable. We're proud of the bravery and sacrifice that our troops are showing in Iraq. These attacks, they're tragic, they're senseless, and the perpetrators of these attacks, they'll be held accountable.\n\nAs for the question of whether or not these attacks are a direct attack on the alliance, I think they're a direct attack on the Iraqi people's aspirations for democracy. I believe that the last thing the Jihadists and the terrorists want is for the Iraqi people to have a chance to live in a free and democratic society.\n\nRegarding the turn over of sovereignty on June the 30th, you know, we've made it very clear that we're committed to meeting that deadline. And I think we're going to meet that deadline. We're on schedule to hold the Iraqi elections, we're on schedule to form a constitution, and we're on schedule to turn over to an Iraqi interim government in June. Now, I also believe that if there are setbacks, if there are attacks that hinder progress, we'll adjust our schedule accordingly.\n\nBut our commitment to democracy, our commitment to freedom, and our commitment to helping the Iraqi people are unwavering. We're not going to let a few negative incidents deter us from our mission."

Well, I'm a strong supporter of this agreement, and I believe it's been a tremendous success for our country, for Mexico, and for Canada. It's opened up markets, it's increased trade, it's created jobs, and it's promoted economic growth. Of course, we've been working to address some of the issues you mentioned, like transportation and agriculture. We're working with our partners to address some of those legitimate concerns.\n\nNow, regarding the Free Trade Area of the Americas, I believe this is an important goal, but it's a complex issue. We share a commitment to free trade and we believe that's what's going to help our economies grow and help our people prosper. And so, I've been very clear in my vision for a Free Trade Area of the Americas, where all the countries of the hemisphere agree to reduce tariffs and other barriers to trade and investment.\n\nNow, I understand that there are differences with countries like Brazil and Venezuela, but I think it's possible to achieve this goal if we negotiate in a spirit of cooperation and goodwill. And that's why I've encouraged my team to be engaged with the countries of the hemisphere to work through these issues and towards a Free Trade Area of the Americas.

The, uh, Democrats have, uh, made it clear they're opposed to private accounts, also known as personal accounts, to give workers a choice in their Social Security, and I respectfully disagree with 'em.\n\nYou know, the Social Security Trust Fund will run out of money by 2042 if we continue down the current path. Now, I know some folks are saying that private accounts would, in some way, siphon off funds that would be necessary for Social Security. But let me tell you, the funds for those accounts would come from the surplus we've been building up over the years.\n\nAnd here's the key point, folks. Right now, Social Security taxes are taken out of your paycheck and put into a trust fund. But, let me ask you, have you taken a good look at that trust fund? It's like a big pile of IOUs, that's all it is. It's not cash. It's a promise to pay. Now, we're not going to break our promises, but we gotta be smart about it.\n\nMy proposal is to take a portion of those surplus funds and put 'em into personal accounts. That way, workers get a chance to invest in the market, they get to own the money, and they get to see a higher return on their money. It'll grow faster, it'll do better than the Burton Debt that we've accumulated currently on our Trust fund.\n\nNow I know some folks have raised concerns about mandatory savings and diverting funds, but our plan is to let workers invest in the market based on voluntary private accounts. Workers can choose, they can opt-in, and they still keep on contributing to the Social Security Trust Fund. We'll still make the promises we made, we'll keep our word.\n\nThe way I see it, personal accounts are like giving the American people a chance to take a piece of their economic destiny in their own hands. They can make decisions, they can manage their own investments, and they can save for their future. It's the American way, and that's why I'm committed to making Social Security more modern, more portable, and more secure. Thank you."

I want to assure the American people that our approach to granting pardons is guided by the Constitution and aimed at righting unjust situations or preventing undue hardship.\n\nAs you know, a presidential pardon is a solemn power vested in the President, and it should be used with great care and discretion. My approach has been to focus on pardoning individuals who have genuinely reformed, have made amends for their past actions, and continue to be a positive force in their communities.\n\nWhile it's true that our number of pardons is lower than some of my predecessor's, I'd prefer to focus on the quality of our efforts rather than the quantity. We've made decisions based on merit, rather than solely on politics. When it comes down to it, every single pardon we issue is about compassion, fairness, and second chances.\n\nNow, I know some out there might view it as stingy. But I'd rather be called cautious and prudent in the exercise of this sacred duty than grant pardons that don't meet the standards we set. I also want to remind the American people that governors and judges, in the vast majority of the cases we've intervened in, they handed down sentences. They did not have to confirm these pardons. Those who have been granted a pardon have actually had to meet several criteria that are hard for many life and cruel prison sentence-based offenders. Those criteria are \u201cContrition, leadership, Social service, Impact of denouncing previous crime, faithfully stirring certified continuous progress under resultant society bodies' lucifers pit,' oversee, substantially institution-compliance spirit zone'.\n\nMake no mistake, pardons are no free get-out-of-jail cards.

Our strategy is focused on ensuring the Iraqi government can govern its own country, secure its own borders, and protect its own citizens. We're making steady progress in removving Saddam Hussein's remaning loyalists from power and in dismantling the regime's infrastructure.\n\nHowever, as I said, we do expect casualties to rise, not just in the short term, but in the near future and beyond. But I believe that the progress we're making, largely thanks to the bravery of our troops, the strength of our alliances and partnerships, and the Iraqi people's yearning for freedom, well, that's worth fighting for.\n\nWe have no greater priority than the safety and recovery of our soldiers. I outlined our commitment to the families of the missing soldiers recently. We're doing everything we can to locate them, and I continue to pray for their safe return.\n\nOne thing I want the American people to know: I understand that the road to a stable Iraq will be difficult and long. There are challenges ahead, as there are in any conflict, but I firmly believe that, in the end, our goals in Iraq are worth achieving.

We've seen the price of oil escalate due to global demand and other factors. While I said that those tax breaks were not necessary when the price was lower, our priorities as a nation have shifted. \n\nMy administration has continuously emphasized the importance of investing in alternative and renewable sources of energy. As we look to address our long-term energy needs, it's clear that we need to diversify our sources. The country's dependence on imported oil is a matter of concern for national security and economic stability.\n\nThe proposal to shift tax breaks to renewables is a step towards creating a more balanced energy policy. We're not abandoning our domestic drilling efforts, but we need to encourage the innovation and investment in new, cleaner technologies. The shift in tax incentives will help for the development and use of alternative energy sources, including wind, solar, and hydrogen fuel cells.\n\nThis is an incremental step in reducing our reliance on foreign oil, reducing our carbon footprint, and promoting a more sustainable energy future for America. It\u2019s a cornerstone in our comprehensive energy plan to ensure we are prepared for the increasing demand for energy and a world with decreasing availability of reserves."

With regards to our military engagement and Defense strategy, my successor will face the same challenges. You'll see continuity between my administration and whoever follows. Of course, the Iraq conflict is one example where we've made great strides in transferring security responsibilities to the Iraqi people... and, as I mentioned before, we now have about 27,000 fewer troops in theatre. My colleagues out there, whether they wear a D or an R after their name, will have to make their own decisions on these matters. But they'll inherit foundations of strength, not weakness. Thank you."

I mean, it's a mixture of demand and supply, and we're looking at all the factors, and that including biofuels, as my Secretary of State indicated.\n\nI agree with her assessment. I think there's no question that the demand for biofuels has put upward pressure on corn prices, and this is causing problems, particularly for the poor and the vulnerable around the world.\n\nNow, what can we do? Well, first, we're gonna continue to work with the World Bank and other international institutions to look for ways to improve food production and distribution around the world. We're also gonna continue to work with other countries on agricultural productivity, and helping them develop more sustainable and efficient food systems.\n\nWe can also encourage the use of other types of feedstocks for biofuels. I think ethanol made from switchgrass or other types of biomass could be a more sustainable and efficient way to produce clean, renewable energy.\n\nAnd let me just say, we're not gonna sacrifice our own agriculture to solve the global problem. We're gonna continue to make sure our farmers are producing to their full potential, while at the same time working with the international community to help those who are suffering from high food prices.\n\nAnd I appreciate your attention to this issue. I think it's very important. I'm gonna continue to work with Congress, with the World Bank, with other international partners, to address this problem. We can make a difference, and we will make a difference.\n\nNow, I know I sometimes get in a bit of trouble for quote\u2014no, unquote\u2014\"doing things that are knee-jerk.\" The president did try to buy a gallon of Arnie's Beef Jerky BBQ Sauce the day after Laura said he didn't see the use for drive-thru windows."

First, I appreciate the sacrifice of every man and woman who serves in our military, and it's evident from the losses we've suffered in June in Afghanistan, that the enemy remains determined to pursue its own twisted objectives. \n\nAfghanistan remains a critical front in our war on terror. We are making progress in certain parts of the country, but the Taliban and Al Qaida are still embedded in certain provinces, particularly in the southern regions. There's still much work to be done.\n\nAs for the surge in Iraq, I was criticized for having ordered a surge of troops there in 2007, and we followed up on that surge with activated troops, additional trainers, and more of an advice-oriented type military strategy in Iraq. Looking ahead to Afghanistan, there are rumor changes being heavily debated in the White House and also announced differently among our Military leaders.\n\nIn response to your second question of how the situation is playing out,  the UUS sees that the roadside bombs, the IEDs, rocket attacks, have gone down in Iraq, though quite different in tactics across different parts of the country."

The violence that's occurring there is chaos, and the civilians caught in the crossfire, innocent women, children, and men, it's a heartbreaking situation.\n\nNow, we are committed to protecting our diplomatic personnel, our Embassy staff, and our assets in Liberia, and that's why you've seen our Marines being deployed. But we're not just focused on our own protection. We're working closely with the U.N., the Economic Community of West African States, and the African Union to find a peaceful resolution to this conflict.\n\nNow, regarding sending U.S. peacekeepers, I don't rule it out.  We are exploring all options available to stabilize the situation in Liberia. We see through the brutality we've seen today that's just not acceptable to us, and we continue to look for ways to bring stability to this wounded nation.\n\nNow, as for the U.N. just recently, I spoke with the U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, and we support a U.N. presence in Liberia, as a component of a broader international effort to stabilize this situation.  Let me be clear, we're committed to supporting African-led peacekeeping efforts, so that the people of Liberia can rebuild their nation.\n\nWe will continue to work with our partners to provide humanitarian aid to those who need it the most, because this conflict is not only just humanitarian, but it also affects U.S. interests abroad."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you.  I understand the question. Let me tell you, I've heard the comparison to Vietnam, and it's interesting. You know, in Vietnam, we were fighting an enemy that had a clear base of operations, a clear command structure. In Iraq, our enemy is different. Saddam Hussein's oppressive regime was a menace to peace, and we had to deal with it.\n\nI understand the skepticism, I understand the doubts, but I don't think the analogy to Vietnam is helpful. This is a conflict about a different kind of struggle. Today, we face an enemy that operates in the shadows, that practices asymmetric warfare, that uses civilians as human shields. This is a difficult and complex conflict, but it's also a winnable conflict.\n\nNow, on the polls, I can tell you that the American people have high expectations. They expect to see results, and we're making progress. We've toppled Saddam Hussein's regime. We're working to build a democracy, a free and stable Iraq. It's a long-term effort, but I'm confident in our strategy, and I'm confident in the writ of the American people. And let me tell you, I'm willing to listen to the skepticism, but I'm not going to be deterred by it.\n\nBut I also want to remind the American people, we went to Iraq for one reason: to make America safer. We believe that Saddam Hussein was a threat to our security, and that his regime was a breeding ground for terror. And so, I'd say to the American people, if you want to evaluate the success of our policy, evaluate it in terms of whether or not we're making America safer, and in my judgment, we are.\n\nI understand the critics, I appreciate the critics, but I believe in what we're doing, and I believe we'll prevail."

The bottom line is that each agency, every decision we made there, however hard the choice was \u2013 we all do the best we can with the information we have.

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you.  Good question from a Canadian friend, I presume. [chuckles]\n\nFirst, let me say that the September 11th attacks were a wake-up call for not just our country, but for the international community as a whole.  That's why I've made it a priority to strengthen our border and our homeland security. We've taken significant steps to secure our northern border, working closely with the Canadians to advance our mutual security interests.\n\nA common security perimeter is an interesting concept.  I think it's definitely worth exploring.  While we're a sovereign nation with our own territorial integrity, I do believe that our two countries share a unique relationship that goes beyond our individual borders.  We're natural partners in every sense of the word.  We share values, we share an open marketplace, and we share a deep respect for one another.\n\nIn terms of specifics, I think a common security perimeter would allow us to share intelligence, to enhance our ability to prevent and respond to threats, and to move towards more seamless travel and trade.  This is already happening through our Smart Border Declaration, which we signed in 2001.  But I think there's more we can do to deepen our cooperation.\n\nAs for marijuana decriminalization in Canada... [chuckles] I'll leave that to your leaders in Ottawa to decide their policies.  As the President of the United States, it's the law of the land under federal law to prohibit the possession, use, and sale of marijuana.  However, I do believe our border should not be a barrier to friendship and trade.  We can still maintain strong security while being good neighbors."

    "gen_response": "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your question. First, let me say that I appreciate the progress that's being made to implement the road-map. Violence has decreased in Gaza, and that's encouraging. And I appreciate the Prime Minister's decision to withdraw from Gaza, which I believe was a difficult decision, but an important one for peace.\n\nNow, as for the question about the West Bank, I believe that Israel is committed to moving forward with the road-map, but there's more work to be done. The key is that the Palestinian leadership must do its part to recognize Israel's right to exist, to renounce terror, and to take steps to end the violence and incitement against Israel.\n\nWe've been communicating extensively with the Israeli government, and I believe they're committed to reform and to supporting the road-map. But I also believe that it's essential that we address the security concerns that Israel has, particularly with regards to missiles and terrorism emanating from the West Bank.\n\nSo, I'm cautiously optimistic about the prospects for peace in the Middle East, but it's not going to be easy. And I appreciate the Prime Minister's commitment to this process. As for whether I got the kind of support I was looking for today, I think it's fair to say that I had a good session with the Israeli government. We discussed a range of issues, including our support for Israel's security concerns and our commitment to the road-map.\n\nNow, I know there are differences within the Israeli government, and there are differences within the US government, as well, but I think we're all united in our support for a democratic Israel and for peace in the Middle East."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you. I appreciate the question. I believe that the American people have been clear in their support for our efforts in Iraq, even if they have had differences of opinion about the necessity of going into Iraq in the first place. I think that's been evident from the very beginning. Now, I think it's also clear that the American people understand the dangers that Saddam Hussein posed, not just to his own people, but to his neighbors, to the world.\n\nNow, Zarqawi's death is a significant victory for our cause, and I think it's given us a chance to experiment with the new Iraqi government. But I think it's also important to consider that we need the support of the American people to sustain our efforts to rebuild Iraq and to bring stability and security to that region.\n\nNow, I've talked to some of the polls, and I think some of them may have mischaracterized the American people's view on this. I believe that there are a lot of Americans who support the war because they believe it was necessary to defend our country, to defend our friends and allies in the region, and to remove a ruthless dictator who was harboring terrorist organizations.\n\nI think also, you know, that there's been a lot of misinformation, a lot of confusion, and frankly, a lot of misinformation about what we've accomplished. We've removed a brutal dictator, we've given the Iraqi people an opportunity to be free, to have their own government, and to govern themselves. I think we have a lot to be proud of.\n\nSo, are the American people winnable back? I absolutely believe they are. I believe that we just need to stay focused on our mission, stay focused on our objectives, and clearly communicate the message to the American people. I also believe we need to let the public see the progress, the positive steps that we're making, and to let the facts speak for themselves. I'm confident that once we do that, the American people will continue to support our efforts in Iraq."

The strategy we've employed in our war on terror is one that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to take decisive action against extremists who seek to harm innocent lives.\n\nWe've made significant progress in the past few years, from toppling Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq to disrupting and dismantling terrorist networks around the world. We've made it clear that those who harbor, support, or engage in terrorism will be held accountable. And while we've had differences of opinion within my administration, I can assure the American people and the international community that our strategy is working.\n\nIt's true that there are democracies and governments around the world who are questioning our tactics, and rightfully so. But to suggest that our moral basis for this fight is flawed is a misconception. The United States is a beacon of freedom and democracy, and we'll continue to stand by the principles of liberty, justice, and human rights.\n\nThe war on terror requires us to confront the very ideology that breeds hatred and violence. It's a battle that requires us to think anew, to be adaptable, and to collaborate with those who share our values and our concern for peace. I'm confident that our strategy is sound, and I believe the American people can trust their military to get the job done. Thank you."

We've got a administration that's been afforded the privilege of serving this great nation, and we've taken that responsibility very seriously.\n\nNow, you're right. Some members of my own party have made mistakes. Some of those mistakes have had consequences, like the overcharging of meals for the inaugural outing at the White House and other instances where people in the government have, uh, fell short.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of the members in my administration and my fellow Republicans in Congress would say that they've conducted themselves with the highest level of integrity and responsibility. After all, these are good Americans who have volunteered public service to do good for this great country.\n\nNow, I will say this, both parties in this town have their part in making things in Washington get a little bit out of control sometimes. The zeal to connect the dots, to make a connection between two auditors that aren't even related to each other, the idea of implicated is not only the individual but the entire administration, the government, shows just how much partisanship plays a part in the day to day business of Congress.\n\nI'd like to think, though, that as Americans look at what we're doing in this administration, we're trying to elevate a very low bar that exists in Washington. We're trying to do things differently, by being accountable, by being transparent, and by being honest when we make mistakes.\n\nWe'll continue to hold the highest standard for ourselves and our fellow members in both parties. And until there is reform, and character, that also will install faith in the political system in this country, that Washington will continue to have its pitfalls. But I believe we can, and I believe we're doing, the best we can."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, John, appreciate that question. Let me tell you, I want to clarify, the National Intelligence Estimate clearly states that the situation in Iraq is indeed violent and sectarian strife has contributed to the situation we see today. However, I don't agree that this is a civil war in the classical sense. It's a difficult, complex, bloody situation, with sectarian violence and terrorism; it does not meet the definition of a civil war, which usually implies two or more groups, one, society, contending for the same institutions, the same government. \n\nNow, as for my comments on victory, I believe that we will not leave Iraq to the fanatics, and we will not leave until the Iraqi people can govern themselves, until they can secure themselves, and we have a fair and just society. That's the definition of victory.\n\nNow, I also want to address the issue of the enemy coming to our shores. You see a direct threat from al-Qaeda because of their stated intent and their ability to, in some respects, operate. I made it clear that we will not wait until they bring us the war. We will go to them, and we will defeat them. We will defeat them abroad.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong; this commitment is not open-ended. We've got a comprehensive strategy with a timeline of benchmarks, including the Iraq Security Forces that will continue to increase in strength. And we believe, John, that by December of '08, we'll see a significant decrease in the American presence in Iraq."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you. I appreciate the question. Well, first, let me say that I welcome the commitment of foreign investors in the United States, and that is the NASDAQ deal with Dubai. I believe that a strong, thriving economy is in the best interest not just of our nation, but the world. It's a sign of confidence in the American system, and I think that's a positive thing.\n\nNow, I understand why some folks on the Hill have concerns. I get it. There are legitimate questions about national security and homeland security. I want to assure the American people that we're taking a very careful and thorough look at this deal to ensure that it's in our nation's interest, that it meets all the relevant laws and regulations, and that it protects our national security.\n\nI'd like to remind my fellow Americans that we're not in the business of saying no to foreign investment because of where it comes from. We're a beacon of hope and opportunity, a place where people from all corners of the world come to invest, to work, and to start businesses. And I believe that's a positive thing for us.\n\nNow, when it comes to protectionism, I'm against it. Protectionism, by its very nature, closes markets, raises prices, and hurts American workers and consumers. The best way to protect our interests is through free trade and open markets. That's why I've worked so hard to pass trade agreements like CAFTA and to get the world to open up. Because when the world opens up, that's when American businesses can compete, that's when American workers can earn a good wage, and that's when America's economy thrives.\n\nAnd I want to remind my fellow Americans that protectionism is a path that sounds good, but it doesn't work. Britain followed a protectionist policy for decades, and what did it get them? A stagnant economy and a loss of global influence. I want America to be the leader of the world, not the follower. And that's by opening markets, not closing them.\n\nSo, I'll tell you this: we're going to take a hard look at this deal, and we'll make a decision based on what's in America's interest. And I'll be writing to Congressional leaders today, telling them to stay focused on free trade and not to let protectionist sentiment dominate our public policy."

Let me take it first, and then we'll let the Prime Minister respond. \n\nAs for your question, we're working diligently with our allies, including Great Britain, to build a coalition of nations that share our concern about the threat of ballistic missiles. Now, I understand that our allies have concerns about the reach and coverage of a missile defense system, and we respect their concerns. But let me be clear: we're not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. We're committed to moving forward with a missile defense system, and we will do so in a way that's consistent with our own national security interests and our obligations to our allies.\n\nThat being said, if we're unable to get agreement on a system that covers the entire continent of Europe, we will still take steps to protect ourselves and our allies. We'll work closely with our European allies to develop a system that protects them, even if it's not a comprehensive system that covers the entire continent. And we'll also work with them to find alternative technologies and approaches that can help address the missile threat.\n\nNow, I'm confident that we can get agreement with our allies, 'cause I think we share a common threat assessment, a common threat analysis. So I'm hopeful that we'll be able to work something out.

We've engaged in numerous consultations with our friends and allies on a range of issues, including our North Korea policy. We believe our collective efforts to peacefully isolate the North Korean regime have been effective, but we are committed to further diplomacy.\n\nRegarding the Kyoto Protocol, we have previously expressed concerns over the treaty's economic implications for our country. Our position on the Kyoto Protocol remains unchanged \u2013 that is, we believe it is a flawed agreement that would pose significant challenges to our economic growth and competitiveness.\n\nAs for relations with some of our allies, I've spoken at length about the importance of staying focused on our shared values and interests. Sometimes, our politics and policies can be misinterpreted, but we mustn't allow disagreements on specific issues to impact the overall strength of our relationships.\n\nIt's also worth noting that when it comes to issues like the Middle East, Iraq, and the fight against terrorism, we've had the support of many of our allies, and our relationship with our closest friends and partners remains strong.\n\nWhile I understand your point about what you've perceived as deteriorating relations, I simply don't see the cumulative effect that some of you may have suggested.

And I will say this: I support any efforts that promote energy independence and lower gas prices. \n\nThat being said, we are not going to just pass bills to please Democrats or special interest groups. We're going to make decisions that are in the best interest of the American people, and that means considering a balanced approach to energy policy. We need to increase our production of domestic oil, natural gas, and alternative sources of energy, but we also need to take care of our environment.\n\nI have to tell you, our record on this issue is clear: we've opened up millions of acres for drilling, we've encouraged the production of more energy, and we've promoted clean technology.\n\nNow, I know there are differences with the Democratic leadership, but I'm willing to work with them to find a solution that works for this country. We'll take a close look at the bill, and if it's good for America, we'll support it.\n\nI'm a man who's willing to make tough decisions, and I won't shy away from tough choices. But what I won't do is pass a bill just to make a point or to score a few political points. We'll do what's right for America, and that's what I'm going to continue to fight for.\n\nSo, to answer your question, we'll take a close look at the bill, but I won't make any promises about what we'll do.

Now, as we go forward, our projections indicate that the total amount will be well over $380 billion in the next five years. That's a significant commitment, but we believe it's a necessary one to guarantee the security of the American people.\n\nIn terms of the breakdown of those costs, it's my expectation that federal funding for homeland security will be the largest share. We're looking at about 60% of the total costs coming from the federal government, with the remaining 40% likely to be covered by state and local governments, as well as the private sector.\n\nWe're working closely with our state and local partners to develop a comprehensive plan for homeland security that takes into account their unique needs and resources. We believe that by working together, we can create a system that's both effective and efficient.\n\nNow, I know that some critics have suggested that this spending is excessive or unwarranted. But let me tell you, the stakes are too high to second-guess the security needs of this nation. We will continue to work with Congress to secure the necessary funding to achieve our goals, and I'm confident that together, we can keep America safe. Thank you."

Asking employees to sign a sworn statement about not being involved in the leak could create a situation where some might be intimidated into lying, or others might refuse to cooperate out of fear of being accused unfairly.\n\nWe've taken a more collaborative approach by working closely with the Justice Department, handing over all relevant information and allowing them to proceed with the investigation without interfering. My administration will not get in the way of the investigation or compromise its integrity.\n\nLet me be clear: the leak of Valerie Plame's identity was wrong, and if you're the leaker, you'll be held accountable.

Well, I appreciate the spirit of bipartisanship shown by Chairman Thomas and others on the Hill as we work to address the many challenges facing our great nation.\n\nNow, on the issue of combining tax reform and Social Security reform, I believe that we must approach these two critical issues with a comprehensive and robust strategy that addresses the long-term security and solvency of our nation's entitlement programs, including Social Security.\n\nThe commission I established, led by Social Security Commissioner Andrew Biggs, Alan Greenspan, and Secretary of the Treasury John Snow, has studied this issue extensively, and I've asked them to work closely with Congress to develop recommendations on how to strengthen Social Security for future generations.\n\nRegarding tax reform, I've been clear in my commitment to a Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that will promote economic growth, simplify the tax code, and provide relief to middle-class families. This, however, is going to take some time and effort, as you know.\n\nWhile I'm open to considering alternatives to the payroll tax, I believe it's premature to endorse a value-added tax at this time. The American people sent me to the White House to fix Social Security, to strengthen our economy, and to ensure our nation's fiscal balance. Improving the fiscal systems needs to be part of the solution. A payroll tax reform with one hand and adding value-added on the other isn't an ideal way that balances the American public's discomfort with tax increases.\n\nIn the right time, we'll have to see it through. I'm looking forward, working with the Congress, to not only solving the problems the country faces today, we're going to address these Challengers head-on: find the American fiscal stability, growing America's economy, leaving America better than we found it."

    "gen_response": "(laughs) Well, thank you for your math skills, and I'm glad to note that the press corps is pretty math-savvy. (chuckles)\n\nNow, let me tell you, I've looked at the numbers. The Trustees of Social Security and the CDI have painted a very clear picture of the fiscal future of Social Security. It's not pretty. The math is clear, the numbers are stark. We're facing a trust fund that'll be depleted by 2042, and the payroll tax will only cover 73 percent of benefits after that.\n\nNow, I think some of my friends on the Hill, both Democrats and Republicans, are not facing the math as squarely as they should. Some are hesitant to address the issue because it's a third rail, as you said, or because they don't want to start a debate about the future of Social Security. They're worried about the election cycle and the politics of it all.\n\nBut let me tell you, I'm not afraid of the math. And I'm not afraid of the politics. I believe Americans need a frank and honest discussion about Social Security's future, and I'm committed to having that discussion. We can't just sweep this under the rug or hide behind political expediency.\n\nWe need to reform Social Security, and we need to do it now, or else we risk leaving our children and grandchildren with a broken system. So, I'm urging my colleagues on the Hill to join me in a serious and honest discussion about the future of Social Security. We owe it to ourselves, we owe it to our country, and especially we owe it to our kids and grandkids."

I think he's done a fine job of serving our country and upholding the law as Attorney General. And he'll have his chance to make his case and respond to the concerns the committee has.\n\nI understand there are differences of opinion on many issues, and that's to be expected in a democracy. But to somehow suggest that my relationship with Mr. Gonzales or the actions of my administration will hinder the work we do on other issues, I think that's a bit of a stretch. We're going to move forward on the legislative agenda that the American people elected us to tackle.\n\nLook, I've got a great relationship with Congress. We've made a lot of progress when we can put partisanship aside and work across the aisle. I'm committed to finding common ground. On judicial nominations, I'm committed to putting forward qualified individuals who will uphold the Constitution and the rule of law. And I'm committed to working with the Senate to ensure that they get confirmed.\n\nSo while the disagreements over Judge Gonzales will certainly be contentious, I don't think it's going to define the relationship between the executive and legislative branches on other issues. We'll continue to work hard to pass important legislation, and I'm confident we can get things done."

It's a sport that's rich in history and tradition, and I believe it's up to the leadership of baseball, and Major League Baseball in particular, to ensure that it's run fairly and responsibly. \n\nNow, the issue of steroid use is a serious one, and it's one that I think all of us need to take seriously. I've spoken out against steroid use in the past, not just for baseball, but for all sports. It undermines the integrity of the game, and it's just not right.\n\nNow, as for the action by Congress, I think it's an interesting development. I understand their concerns about the issue, and I appreciate their effort to address it. However, I do think that they should be careful not to overstep their bounds and intervene too much in the internal affairs of sports. The Baseball Commissioner, Bud Selig, and the players union should be the primary players in addressing this issue."

    "gen_response": "I've taken a strong stance on stem cell research and alternative sources of stem cells that don't destroy life, such as adult stem cells and umbilical cord blood. When it comes to fertility treatments and the creation of extra embryos, I've always looked at these issues through the lens of protecting life.\n\nAs you've noted, I've stated that I believe life begins at conception, and every life is created in the image of God. With that in mind, the creation of multiple embryos during in vitro fertilization or other fertility treatments is a concern to me. I understand that these embryos, though deemed \"spare\" or \"excess,\" are still human life, and therefore, deserving of respect and protection.\n\nNow, the disposition of those embryos presents a difficult question, but one to which I'd like to offer my perspective. As Governor of Texas, I supported legislation that allowed for the creation of \"adoption programs\" for embryos. Under these programs, individuals or couples would be able to adopt embryos that might otherwise be discarded. It's a compassionate and personal approach that respects the sanctity of life.\n\nHowever, federally, I've worked with Congress to promote the creation of embryonic stem cell lines obtained from existing embryos created prior to 2001. These stem lines wouldn't grow contingent on the continuation of embryonic stem cell research in the U.S. Using these existing stem cell lines for research will help us advance scientific understanding and the pursuit of medicinal therapies without crossing the line that separates human life from experimentation. This diffused way to approach the venture leans closer to easing the discomfort around loss during the IVF process.\n\nWhile there's still a complexity here, as a pro-life president, I've taken steps to stand up for those who can't protect themselves."

I mean, I know some folks do, but I think what's important is doing what I think is right for the country, and I think that's what I've been trying to do.\n\nNow, as for the PATRIOT Act, I agree with that bill. I think it's essential for national security. I think it helps our law enforcement agencies to prevent terrorism. It's a vital tool in the fight against al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. I'm proud of the bipartisan support it got in Congress, and I think it's a positive step forward.\n\nRegarding my approval ratings, I think it's natural for any president to get criticized. Some folks don't agree with my policies, that's okay. But I believe my leadership has been strong, and I've made some tough decisions as president, like invading Iraq, to protect the United States. I know some Americans don't agree with that decision, and that's okay. It's democracy.\n\nAs for independents, I'm not worried about it. I'm focused on doing what's right, and if some people disagree, that doesn't faze me. I'm a decision-maker, not a focus-grouper."

    "gen_response": "(Chuckles) Thank you, thank you. Let me address this directly. The Prime Minister's comments were made in the context of our ongoing diplomatic effort to address the threat posed by Iran's nuclear program. This administration, and I mean my administration, the previous administration, has been clear about our commitment to the security and stability of the Middle East, and we're going to continue to work with the international community to disincentivize Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe window of opportunity, as the Prime Minister described it, is a fluid concept. It's not a fixed timeline. We're looking at a moment in time where the Iranians, through diplomatic pressure, through international pressure, are beginning to consider the alternatives to their path down the nuclear highway. Now, we're not seeking to impose our own solution, but we hope that they will see the wisdom in giving up their nuclear desires, their pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n\nI will not get into the details of our diplomatic efforts at this time, but I will tell you this: we're making progress. We're engaged with the Iranians, and we look forward to continued productive talks. But, let me be clear: this administration will not be tied to a fixed timetable. We will not place a artificial deadline on progress. Our goal is to ensure that Iran does not acquire nuclear capabilities.\n\nThe next step, as we move forward, will depend on the decisions made by the Iranian leadership. We're engaging with them, and we hope that they will respond positively to our concerns. Now, we're working closely with our allies and partners to ensure that our enforcement strategy is in place, and our aim is to, as I said, ensure that Iran does not acquire nuclear capabilities.\n\nNow, I know there's a lot of skepticism out there about the prospects for success, and I understand that. But, I want to assure the American people, and the world, we're making progress. We're working diligently towards a peaceful resolution to this crisis. And I'm confident that, ultimately, we'll be able to achieve our goals."

I believe that the contrast between the economic visions of our party and the Democratic party is stark.\n\nIf Republicans retain control of Congress, we will continue to implement the fiscal discipline that's served this country so well. We'll keep our commitment to lower taxes, to reduce government spending, and to promote economic growth. Our tax relief plan has already put more money in the pockets of the American people, and it's helped to stimulate business investment and hiring. We'll continue to support small business growth, promote free trade, and encourage entrepreneurship.\n\nOn the other hand, if the Democrats take over, they'll likely pursue a course of economic policies that are more government-centered and less business-friendly. They'll probably raise taxes to fund more government programs, which will stifle economic growth and cost jobs. They'll also likely increase government regulations, which will cramp the ability of businesses to innovate and compete. And I worry that we'll see a significant increase in frivolous lawsuits, which will only serve to add costs for business and create uncertainty.\n\nNow, I want to be clear: the Democratic party has a right to their views, and I respect that. But I believe that our vision for the economy is the better one, and I'm confident that the American people will agree when they head to the polls in November.\n\nAnd let me add, I'm proud of the work we've done on the economy, my fellow Americans have seen life-long prescriptions rise and the stock market rise to over 14 thousand.In our vision, the economy grows with fairness and with opportunities, with limited government with greater freedom."

I would advise the American people that their Congress cannot unilaterally usurp the constitutional authority of the Commander-in-Chief by withdrawing funds from the military in the middle of a war. \n\nIt'd be a stark reminder of the perils of politics trumping national security. That being said, we will not bow to threats and confrontation from the Congress or any other entity. If we have to work out the fine print, and I'm confident we will, we will continue to insist that our military has the resources it needs to complete the mission."

We're also encouraging them to work towards a comprehensive, two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nOn my requests from them, we're asking our friends to:\n\nOne, continue their efforts to combat terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda, Hamas, and Hezbollah. These organizations pose a threat not just to the Middle East but to the world.\n\nTwo, we're urging our friends to support democratic reform and institutions. We know that democratic governments are more stable, more prosperous, and better equipped to resist the forces of extremism.\n\nThree, we're encouraging them to come to the table and work towards a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. A two-state solution, with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace, is essential for the stability and prosperity of the region.\n\nWe believe that by working together, we can achieve great things in the Middle East.

As I said earlier today, this is a problem that requires a comprehensive approach, and it's going to take effort from all of us to get it done. Now, I know that there's been a lot of disagreements within our own party on energy policy, and I'm not naive to the fact that it's a challenge to get things done in Congress.\n\nBut let me tell you, I'm committed to working with the Senate and the House to find common ground. I've already reached out to Democratic leaders, including Senator Reid and Speaker Pelosi, to begin a dialogue on this issue. I understand that we won't agree on everything, but I'm willing to listen to their ideas and to work with them to find solutions.\n\nNow, I know that some of my fellow Republicans may have expressed differing opinions on energy policy, but let me tell you, I'm the president, and my job is to bring people together and find a way forward. I've got a responsibility to the American people to take action, and I'm committed to doing just that.\n\nSo, I'd say to the American people, I'm serious about addressing this crisis, and I'm serious about working with Congress to get it done. I'll keep communicating with the American people, and we'll work through these differences to find a solution that will make a difference for our country. Thank you."

As I'm sure you know, we've raised the threat level of our homeland security to orange. Now, it's crucial that we all understand what that means.\n\nIn terms of what people should be on the lookout for, I'd like to encourage everyone to exercise vigilance and awareness. While the threat posed by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Osama bin Laden, and the other high value targets listed on our wanted list is significant, there are other potential threats that we're working to address.\n\nWe urge citizens to be alert to the possibility of suspicious activity, particularly in public places like shopping malls, airports, public transportation and other areas that are often frequented by large crowds. \n\nIf you see something that seems out of the ordinary, take note. If you see something that doesn't seem right, contact your local authorities immediately. That may be something as simple as someone loitering or lingering in an unusual area or trying to take pictures of our critical infrastructure.\n\nWe've also seen that in many cases, the potential signs of terrorist activity can range from the misuse of technology to planning and organization. So we encourage people to be aware of any suspicious online or phone usage indicating suspicious communications that could indicate a terrorist plot.\n\nThe FBI and my administration's Department of Homeland Security are all working together to provide you with the resources and information necessary to help identify potential threats, and I urge Americans to use this information wisely. If you see something, say something. If you see something that makes you think something's off, report it to the authorities immediately.\n\nDon't let fear dictate your behavior, but at the same time, remain vigilant, remain trustworthy, and work together as a nation to keep America secure."

The relationship between the United States and Russia is complex, but we're making progress on some key issues. I'm committed to reducing nuclear stockpiles, and we're working closely with the Russian government to identify areas where we can reduce the number of nuclear warheads.\n\nRegarding your question about the signing of agreements, I'd say that it's possible, but we're not yet at that point. We've made progress, but the hard work of writing treaty language is still ahead of us. We're going to continue to work closely with the Russian government to get it right, to make sure the agreement meets our national security interests, and to ensure that it's a durable, verifiable, and enforceable treaty.\n\nAs for the issue of destroying versus storing nuclear warheads, that's an important question. We're looking at different options for disposing of nuclear warheads, and I'm not prepared to make a final decision today.

The Iranian government has been pursuing a nuclear program that, if developed, could provide them with the capacity to create nuclear weapons. We've been working through international forums to isolate Iran from the global economy and to put pressure on them through various sanctions.\n\nIt's not a question of marching to war.

The United States has a long history of engagement and friendship with the countries of Latin America, and we're committed to continuing that relationship.

Our National Security Strategy for the Americas is focused on consolidating our alliances, forging new partnerships, and promoting economic and democratic development throughout the hemisphere.\n\nWe believe that trade, not aid, is the best way to help the people of Latin America. We'll continue to push for free trade agreements, such as NAFTA and the proposed FTAA, to increase trade and investment opportunities for American businesses and improve living standards for the people of the region. We'll also continue to support democratic reforms, promote the rule of law, and combat the scourge of narcotics trafficking.\n\nWe'll address the issue of the growing presence of China in the region, by engaging in diplomacy and multilateral partnerships such as the OAS, and trying to ensure that we're providing the kind of support and help to our Latin American partners that we can, in order to build and strengthen institutions and economies.\n\nWe'll also make sure to continue working on bilateral relationships with countries in the region.

And we believe that this movement of public opinion is very significant, and it underscores the international community's intolerance for the kind of terror tactics that Hizballah employs.\n\nIn regards to Secretary Rice's mission, she will go back to the region and be meeting with leaders -- with leaders in Lebanon, in Israel, and possibly in Syria. I've asked her to continue to press for a cease-fire, to work with the Security Council to pass a resolution, and to -- and to encourage the various parties to work towards a lasting resolution to this conflict. We'll see what she'll come back and tell us."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, appreciated. That's a great question. You're right, the NPT doesn't explicitly prohibit uranium enrichment, but it's built into the capacity of Iran to pursue peaceful nuclear energy. However, the international community's concern is that Iran's enrichment program goes beyond the need for peaceful purposes. We know they have made statements that they would like to have a nuclear deterrent, which we believe does not serve the interests of regional or global security.\n\nIran signing the additional protocol to the NPT, that's the thing that gives the IAEA inspectors' ability to gain extra access into theiruclear facilities. However, we believe that's not sufficient here, that with all that they're doing, that there's something more there that requires bilateral action to be taken, as well as engaging with other countries and the U.N. Security Council.\n\nAs far as the sanctions, obviously, we believe that they're essential to putting pressure on the Iranian government to make the right decision on their nuclear program. We're working internationally to build a consensus on that, and we believe we've made good progress, especially we've united nations like Russia, China to join with us and put additional sanctions on a nation that refuses to hold up its obligations as a signatory to the NPT."

    "gen_response": "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your questions regarding Iraq and the current situation on the ground. \n\nFirstly, regarding troop reductions, General Petraeus, Secretary Gates, and I will continue to assess the security situation on the ground. We had anticipated reaching pre-surge troop levels by July and, based on the assessments, it's possible that there could be some additional drawdowns. However, any decisions regarding troop levels will be based on the opinions and advice from our General officers and our intelligence community.\n\nAs you know, I'm making decisions with the input of experts and experienced individuals on this very issue. The US Army, and our coalition partners have worked hard to secure Baghdad and stabilize the Anbar Province, hence what happens next is based upon statuses resulting from these efforts.\n\nSecondly, concerning Iran and the visit of its President, Mahmoud Ahmadi-nejad, we generally oppose the Iranian President's positions on various global issues. I consider his policies as counterproductive, to say the least, and dangerous when supporting extremist movements and the networks of regime.\n\nHosting him in Iraq does demonstrate the flexibility that Iraq's leaders are exercising as they try to navigate their new circumstances. However, that being said - the message we're sending to Tehran remains that any hostile actions toward Iraq, the wider region, or toward the United States will be met severely by a strong response. All in all, Iran under its current leadership is a challenging factor in this Middle East drama, though it's our job to continue that fair diplomatic approach for a world we want, and protect what's best for the United States."

However, when it comes to enforcing sanctions, I'm proud to say that the United States has been a strong proponent of tough action against the Iranian regime.\n\nWe believe that the package presented by the Europeans includes a balanced approach that offers Iran a way to re-engage with the international community while addressing our concerns about its nuclear program. We're working closely with our allies in the G-8 and in the United Nations to ensure that the full weight of international pressure is applied to the Iranian regime.\n\nWhile I understand that some of our allies may have concerns about the impact of economic sanctions, I believe that this path is the best way to bring Iran to the negotiating table and to address this threat. I've been talking to various leaders, including some of our closest allies, and I believe that they share my commitment to this goal.\n\nNow, I'm not suggesting that this is going to be an easy or popular decision, but I believe it's the right one. With regard to the G8, we've made progress in terms of getting everybody on the same page. We've seen even some of the resistant countries begin to give way to our position. We believe that this is a team effort, and I'm confident that with the support of our allies, we can achieve our goal of preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.\n\nRegarding, the willingness for us to penalize and retract what we believe might happen under the special license that the EU group has to control oil exports, I think the U.S. capability and position have supported that we are certainly contenders to this objective."

Their desire to spread their influence, to export terror, is a threat to stability, prosperity, and security in many nations.\n\nWe stand in solidarity with our friends in Peru, as we do with other countries in the region, in our fight against terror. If President Toledo requests our assistance, we will certainly consider it, taking into account the needs of his country and the competencies of the U.S. in counter-terrorism efforts.\n\nWe've already been working with Colombia to combat narco-terrorists, and I am proud to say that we have made significant progress in helping the Colombian people to defeat this threat. I believe that this success will serve as a model for other countries in the region. However, I also recognize that this is a complex and long-term challenge, and it will require continued cooperation and support from all countries.\n\nThe Colombian government has made strides in pushing back the FARC, and it's our hope that these efforts will be sustained in the years to come. We will continue to work with President Uribe and his government, as well as President Toledo, to combat this shared threat.\n\nAnd, as I've said many times before, we're also committed to supporting Peru and other countries in their efforts to build up their own capacity to fight terror. We believe that the best way to defeat terrorism is to give countries in the region the tools they need to take ownership of this fight.\n\nUltimately, our goal in the Andean region, as it is in the Middle East, Africa, and elsewhere, is to support free nations that share our values of liberty, democracy, and the rule of law. And in that endeavor, I believe, we will be working closely with our partners in Peru and across the region."

Some of the Democrats are going to try to use my time at Harken to score some cheap political points, that's what they're going to do.\n\nNow, I did work at Harken Energy after I left the oil and gas trade. I bought a few shares, I made a profit, I paid taxes on it, no question about that. The Securities and Exchange Commission reviewed my business dealings at Harken, and they found nothing for which I was held accountable.\n\nRegarding the timing of my stock sale, let me say it was a complex set of circumstances, but it was within the parameters of the law. I sold the shares August 1990, after a federal audit indicated that the company's financial condition was 'questionable.' The accounting firm that did the audit said that my financial situation was fine, but the health of Harken was up in the air. \n\nAs the SEC has said, the delay in the report not harmed any investors, and I paid all my dues on my '92 delivery."

Firstly, I want to reassure the American people and the world that our military is the strongest it's ever been. We're committed to defending our interests and our security, and we're working closely with our allies to achieve our objectives in different parts of the world.\n\nNow, regarding the issue of troop deployment, I understand the concerns about maintaining our troop levels in various regions. Let me put it this way: our military is the most flexible, lethal, and capable military in the world. And we will continue to deploy our troops where our interests demand it.\n\nAs for Kosovo, Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Korea, we have strategic interests in all these regions, and we will maintain a robust presence to ensure regional stability and security. We'll continue to work with our allies and partners to address these challenges. I believe, however, we have a strong military that can multitask and take on new challenges.\n\nWith respect to Liberia and the question, President Mbeki, I think it's essential that the international community has a strong presence in West Africa, especially given the current situation. I go back some time ago to African development. We had Col colonel Dorothy Miller on from Segasum into Liberia immediately.  African leaders have got to tackle the work with morass in that nation.\n\nI commend the efforts of President Olusegun Obasanjo, President Muammar Gaddafi and  President Thabo Mbeki, among others, for their roles in this effort.

The Palestinian situation is a very complex issue, and it's a challenge that has been facing the international community for far too long. As you know, we've been quite clear about our stance on Arafat - that he must make a decisive turn towards reform, take decisive action against terrorism, and yes, share power more broadly within the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThat being said, Arafat has been, yes, hanging on to power, and that's not acceptable. I do view his influence as a problem. And the fact that the new Palestinian Authority could potentially be controlled by those closely tied to Arafat's agenda is a concern.\n\nNow, as you know, our administration's position is to support a viable, democratic Palestinian state alongside Israel at peace. And I believe that for that to happen, the Palestinian people must have an honest and accountable leadership.\n\nNow, the Israeli government has made it clear that Arafat is not in the picture for their vision of the future.  I understand that position.  The question then becomes how do we move forward with, in effect, managing the Arafat situation in a way that allows us to pursue that peace solution? \n\nHere's what we're going to do: We'll continue to encourage reforms, and to challenge Arafat's control over the Palestinian Authority through our diplomatic efforts, and through specific policy actions like US aid. We'll also continue to assert our commitment to the necessary conditions for peace progress.\n\nOn the question of whether we can go around Arafat, that's a fair question. The short answer is, yes, we will. But, you know, it's a fact that Arafat has scheduled authority, and that makes him a key figure nevertheless.\n\nWhen a new Palestinian government is formed - possibly with a prime minister who may be more power-sharing and more willing to reform - that will give the president, the Israeli government, and the international community an opportunity to examine this new entity and seize on a real effort towards democracy and reforms in Palestine.  The American administration will continue to pursue support for any movement that takes steps in the right direction."

The fact is, our commitment to stability in the region is unchanged. The handover on June 30th signifies the beginning of a new era for Iraq - one in which the Iraqi people are in charge of their own fate. As for veto power, it's not about oppression, it's about writing clear expectations into the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL) that sets the stage for a workable governance structure for Iraq.\n\nThe TAL allows for adequate controls and measures to ensure the safety and security of the Iraqi people, and for areas where those controls are lacking, we have, and we will continue to work closely with the U.N. and other countries, to implement the measures to perform this. Implementation of differences in view will most likely naturally come from acceptance over time."

I understand that transitioning to a system of private retirement accounts would indeed come with transition costs.  I agree with Alan that it's essential to get it right, to make sure that we're not putting at risk the Social Security system that we've worked so hard to preserve.\n\nI want to make it clear that I'm not proposing to divert money directly from Social Security to fund private accounts.  That's not on the table.  What I am proposing is to use some of the surplus in the Social Security system to provide the seed money for these private investment accounts.\n\nNow, I understand that the transition costs would be substantial.  And I'll work with the experts to ensure that we implement a gradual phase-in of the program, one that will spread out the costs over time.  We'll have to make some tough choices, but I believe it's essential that we take action now to ensure the long-term solvency of Social Security.\n\nAnd I want to emphasize that the benefits of private accounts far outweigh the transition costs.  Giving Americans more control over their own retirement savings, the opportunity to earn a higher rate of return on their investments, and the chance to leave a legacy for their families is a worthy goal.\n\nSo, I'm willing to work with the best minds in the country, with Alan Greenspan and others, to find a way forward that addresses his concerns while also meeting the promise of preserving and strengthening Social Security for future generations.

I also want to know where they stand on 2nd Amendment rights, our country's tradition of law enforcement, and judicial integrity.\n\nThe questions asked during that in-depth interview will also touch on their vision for interpreting the law, judicial conservatism, the concept of stare decisis, their commitment to the rule of law, and to awakening the limited role of state sovereignty versus judicial activism.

And I appreciate the opportunity to address these issues.\n\nFirstly, in the months following 9/11, the world was at a critical moment. We had suffered a devastating attack on our nation, and we knew that we had to take swift action to disrupt and dismantle the terrorist networks responsible for it. As part of that effort, I made it clear that the United States would not hesitate to act against any country that harbored or supported those who plotted against us.\n\nRegarding President Musharraf's claim, I can tell you that we were resolute in our resolve to track down and bring the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks to justice. However, we did have a dialogue with President Musharraf, and we made our intentions clear. While I wouldn't comment on hypotheticals, our goal was to have a coalition of the willing and gain international support to root out the terrorist networks in Afghanistan.\n\nAs for whether we would have attackedPakistan, I'll say that our military planners and foreign policy experts considered all options and the potential consequences of any military action. But it's also crucial to acknowledge that President Musharraf, at the time, was a key partner in our efforts to combatglobal terrorism.\n\nRegarding John Armitage's (NSA John Armitage) role, that's an interesting point. I will say that Special Adviser Richard Armitage made clear our intentions to Pakistan, and that's part of what convinced President Musharraf to cooperate with our efforts. We had to make tough decisions, but I believe that our combined efforts ultimately made a difference in the global fight against terrorism.\n\nLastly, I want to emphasize that our commitment to keeping Americans safe will not waver. We stand by our allies, and we won't hesitate to stand up to those who seek to harm us. I've said before that the world is either with us, or with the terrorists. In the case of Pakistan, we worked with President Musharraf to fashion a partnership that countered terrorist networks and brought stability to the region.\n\n(smirks) Well, I hope that answers your question."

Saddam Hussein was a dictator who had used weapons of mass destruction against his own people, and had the capacity and the intent to continue to do so. Now, I understand that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and his Al Qaida in Iraq organization, they're a different entity from the group that attacked us on 9/11. But they shared a common enemy, a common enemy in the form of freedom and democracy.\n\nAnd I believe that the liberation of Iraq has helped to create a new front in the War on Terror. We've had to deal with the aftermath, with a lot of innocent lives lost, and a lot of sacrifice on the part of our fine men and women in the United States military. I still believe that in the long term, the elimination of Saddam Hussein and the transfer of sovereignty to the people of Iraq is a major blow to terrorism and a major asset for our security.\n\nNow, I know some people have argued that we shouldn't have put our troops in harm's way, and that we should have just focused on Bin Laden and his organization. But the question of whether we've enhanced or hindered terror organizations by removing Saddam Hussein, that's a matter of ongoing debate. We all know Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator, a sponsor of terrorism, and with the help of our allies and friends around the world, we believe that we have made the world a safer place.\n\nSo I understand that there are arguments that can be made on both sides, but let me say I'm convinced that our efforts to bring freedom to the people of Afghanistan, Iraq, and other countries in the region have been a benefit to our security and a major partner in the fight against terror."

Let me be clear: in the months and weeks leading up to the invasion of Iraq, the intelligence consensus, and I repeat, was that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. That's why, as a president, I based my decision-making on the best information we had at the time.\n\nNow, with regard to the NIE, the National Intelligence Estimate, released in October of 2002, it was a summary of the collective views of the intelligence agencies. And it concluded that Iraq was continuing to develop its WMD programs.\n\nNow, I understand that some have questioned the administration's actions, and that's okay. We're a nation of debate. But let me be clear: in the give-and-take of trying to protect this country, you'll never have perfect information. You'll never have a 100% guarantee.

But I'd say there's actually a foundation upon which we can build some common ground. We both understand that a stable and secure Europe is in the best interest of both our nations.\n\nWhen it comes to missile defense, I believe it's essential to note that our system is designed to protect our NATO allies from potential threats from a sanctioned state, such as Iran or North Korea. It's purely defensive in nature, and we've tried to make clear that it's not a threat to Russia's legitimate security concerns.\n\nAs for NATO expansion, we've made it clear that we want to bring liberty and democracy to countries seeking membership.

Some have expressed concerns about the potential implications for their national security, and we've listened to those concerns.\n\nAt the same time, we're not going to shy away from our values or our commitment to Article 5, which states that an attack on one is an attack on all.

As I said earlier, our policy towards Russia is one of engagement, and we're working towards a new relationship with Russia that's based on mutual interests and mutual respect. Now, as for incentives, we're willing to offer Russia cooperation in several areas, including counter-terrorism, non-proliferation, and arms control.\n\nRegarding the missile defense system, I don't think it's a question of offering Russia a specific incentive in exchange for their cooperation. Our policy on missile defense is driven by the threat that we see from nations like North Korea and Iran, and the need to protect the American people and our allies in Europe. However, I do believe that we can find a way to address Russia's concerns about the potential impact of our missile defense system on their interests.\n\nAs for describing Russia, I wouldn't use the term \"adversary.\" I think \"adversary\" implies a certain level of hostility that we don't see as a defining characteristic of our relationship with Russia right now. Instead, I prefer to use the term \"strategic nation\" or a \"great power\" to describe Russia. We believe that Russia has a significant role to play in international affairs, and we're looking for opportunities to work together with them on areas of common interest.\n\nNow, I also believe that Russia can become a more successful and more stable nation, and we're willing to work with them to achieve that goal.

In regards to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, also known as START III, it is a landmark agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation that ensures a certain level of nuclear parity between our two nations. The treaty limits the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads, bombers, and intercontinental ballistic missiles, as well as other aspects of our nuclear arsenals.\n\nAs part of this treaty, we have agreed to reduce our strategic nuclear delivery vehicles from 18,000 to 10,000, and to limit the number of deployed strategic warheads on these delivery systems, ranging from 1,700 to 2,200. This reduction in our nuclear arsenal will continue the goal of disarmament, while maintaining a safe and secure deterrent capability to defend the United States and its allies.\n\nIn terms of terminating the treaty, it's worth noting that the treaty provides for notice periods and procedures for either side to withdraw from the agreement. However, a country wishing to withdraw must provide a written notice to the other party at least six months prior to the date of withdrawal. The notice must also be certified by the US Senate, as per the requirements of the US Constitution.\n\nRegarding Russia remaining as a nuclear target for our nuclear forces, yes, it is true that the threat posed by Russia remains a concern for the United States national security. However, we continue to have a strong commitment to our Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction efforts, which aims to secure and dismantle Russia's nuclear and chemical weapons, as well as to pursue arms control agreements with Russia.\n\nIn terms of our new strategic relations with Russia, we're making significant progress. As you know, we've taken important steps, including the signing of the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, the U.S.-Russia Treaty, which further reduces the number of our nuclear warheads and limits our nuclear delivery vehicles to 1,700, and we'll work towards further reductions. We also have cooperative programs in ballistic missile defense and counter-terrorism. We have also agreed to launch joint civilian and military space programs. However, we also are clear-eyed about the ongoing challenges with Russia, including the issue of narcotics, global crime activity and an aggressive military build-up in flashpoints of crisis.\n\nBut, at the same time, we are pushing forward with deep diplomatic engagement around all ranges of topics. This benefits world stability.  By potential movement in the short or long term, we both countries can express positive informed societies.\n\nThe past conditions that have hindered our bilateral relationship and today many rewards come from combined vision of drawing plain lines on past treaties where a simple fulfillment on conditioned acts mutually benefical results.\n\nOverall, we believe this changed dynamic represents a new era in our relations and offers many benefits for the United States, Russia, and indeed, for the world.\n\nThank you for the question. Chief of Staff, wrap up."

I do take personal responsibility for the words I chose, and I understand why they might've been unpopular with some folks out there. However, my intention, as I expressed that evening, was to warn the world of the very real threat that terrorists pose to all of us, regardless of their oil supplies. Whether in the United States, in Africa, or elsewhere. Now I'm a man who believes firmly in a tough yet clear communication of our nation's intentions.\n\nRegarding the situation in Iraq and in Africa, I understand the frustration that our allies and friends around the world may share with us over their involvement.  It's our judgment, as well as key partners, that the involvement of our armed forces is necessary for the stability in these regions. Our intentions remain straightforward: we aim for a robust global partnership in countering terrorism worldwide."

I'd like to address the concerns that have been raised about the transition in Iraq.\n\nFirst, let me say that I understand the skepticism, but I assure you, this decision was not made lightly. Our commitment to the Iraqi people and our coalition partners remains strong. The June 30th handover date was established by the United Nations Security Council unanimously, and we believe it's essential to meet this deadline for the sake of the Iraqi people and the entire region.\n\nRegarding the transfer of power, the lack of a single, unified Iraqi organization to assume authority is a significant challenge. However, we're working with the Iraqi leadership and Interim Prime Minister Allawi to establish a stable and effective governing structure.\n\nIt's my administration's preference that the power be transferred to a democratically elected Iraqi government, but if you're asking about an alternative, a possible option would be the Iraqi Transitional Government of National Unity or I.G.N.U. They're currently the governing authority in Iraq, made up by the different factions. \n\nBut, as I've said before, our ultimate goal is to give the Iraqi people the gift of liberty, self-governance, and security through their own freely elected leaders, and we're working closely with them to make this vision a reality."

But as we continue to move forward, the overall cost of our engagement in Iraq and Afghanistan will be significant, but also, I think, it'll be worth it. We're eradicating a terrorist regime, which could've used weapons of mass destruction on our nation.\n\nRegarding the troop level, we're not looking to send more, and in fact, we're looking to implement a plan to be able to begin the handover of authority to the Iraqi government. Our plan in terms of troop levels will depend on the security situation on the ground. And as the situation in Iraq stabilizes, I anticipate a reduction in troop levels. But we will continue to keep a strong military presence to ensure the security of that fledgeling democracy.\n\nRegarding your second question, Tony Blair and I have discussed the Middle East peace process, and I agree with him that peace in the Middle East is essential. I also agree that a two-state solution, with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security, that is the way forward. However, it's a very tough issue, as you might expect, with entrenched positions on both sides. The U.S. government supports a Middle East peace process, and I'll continue to work with Tony Blair, with the Iraqis, the Israelis, and Palestinians to find a path forward.\n\nIt won't be easy; it's gonna take time, patience, and hard work. But I'm optimistic. I'm optimistic that we can find a path forward that will give the people in the Middle East hope, so they can begin to live in peace and prosperity."

First, I want to say that these are indeed what I'd call bumps in the road, short-term concerns, but we're still optimistic about the long-term prospects of our economy.\n\nWhile it's true that growth numbers were lower than expected, I believe it's partly a result of higher energy costs, and it's partly due to the transitions we're making in our economy, transitioning from a dependence on old industries to new ones. We're becoming more energy-independent, that's taking some time, and that's causing a short-term disruption.\n\nAs for inflation, I'm monitoring it closely, and I'm confident that the Federal Reserve is doing a good job of keeping a close eye on it and making the necessary adjustments to ensure that our economy remains stable.\n\nAnd on consumer spending, I think it's true that people are feeling a little more cautious right now. But I also believe that the fundamentals of our economy remain strong. Americans are working hard, they're saving, they're investing, and they're optimistic about the future.\n\nNow, as for Social Security, we remain committed to our agenda to strengthen it. We've got a proposal on the table that's designed to make adjustments that will ensure the solvency of Social Security for future generations. And I'm not backing down on that. We've got a plan, we're working on it, and we're committed to making it work.\n\nNow, I will say, I do believe that our Social Security reform is separate from these short-term economic concerns. We're not wavering on our commitment to Social Security because of any short-term bump in the road. We're committed to making sure that Americans have a secure future, and that includes protecting and preserving Social Security."

First and foremost, I've been very clear in my administration's position concerning the settlements. I believe that settlements should not expand. I've made that plain to Prime Minister Sharon, and to other Israeli leaders as well.\n\nThe problem here is that the Palestinian leaders haven't done their job of inciting terrorism. Now, I know there are plenty of folks out there who disagree, but the fact is, we need to have progress on the road map. It's time for the Palestinian leaders to make a choice: are they going to choose a path of peace or a path of terror?\n\nNow, our position, as I said, is that there should be a freeze on settlement activities. And while Israel has agreed to some freezes in the past, it's also true that they have also continued some settlement construction even in areas of disputed territory.\n\nAs to the wall that's being constructed, we have expressed our concerns with Israel about the security fence. But we're taking a step-by-step approach here. We're working closely with Israel, and other parties involved, to resolve these issues in the Camp David framework, even though the second Intifada pretty much cancelled all we used to discuss there.\n\nAgain, I think the root cause here is the terrorism, the violence, the fact that there's no stability, and no clear authority in the Palestinian government that can, for instance, prevent terrorist organizations from commiting attacks.\n\nSo our goal is to get to a point where we're at a two-state solution with Israel and the Palestinians living side by side in peace. It's achievable, and it's key."

A significant number of top-notch workers are from foreign countries, and we welcome their participation and contributions. This nation of immigrants is one of our greatest assets. \n\nHowever, when faced with foreign acquisition of an American company with military contracts, the administration, through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States or CFIUS, will conduct thorough investigations to ensure it aligns with our national security interests. Our focus is on identifying potential security risks, recognizing that we need to balance a free-market economy and the flow of capital and goods with the need to protect our national defense."

If they don't seize that opportunity, the international community will have to turn to other measures. \n\nWith regards to the G8 Summit, we're committed to maintaining momentum on this global effort to make sure Iran doesn't acquire a nuclear weapon. I think you can expect discussions on Iran to be a major point of focus at the summit. I also think that Summers seat at the G8 gives us a best chance to pin down any countries that may provide fuel miracle to an Iran enriched uranium over this deadline.\n\nWe are continuing to work closely with our partners and friends to ensure that together we don't just address Iran's enrichment activities but also make sure they expand their cooperation so the nuclear border is secured, the progress stays intact.\n\nRegarding frustrated Americans, it's understandable. It's also understandable to get firmer and stronger in one's leadership, so America needs patience and hospitality when working on this tough issue.

And yeah, I drew that line in the sand.

And we will continue to work closely with like-minded countries around the world to make sure that those weapons do not pose a threat to any country, including the United States.\n\nAt the same time, we remain open to negotiations.

And I've got to tell you, it's easy 20-20 hindsight to sit here and think about things you might've done differently.\n\nHowever, let me tell you, we went to war in Iraq with a crystal-clear objective to disarm Saddam Hussein from WMDs. We believed at the time Saddam had WMDs, and we had intelligence to back that up. Upon finding none, we then shifted our focus, shifted our mission, to democracy and freedom. We wanted to make sure the Iraqi people had \u2013 as the President of the United States I wanted the Iraqi people to be able to determine their own future.\n\nThat being said, I've come to realize we might have overestimated our progress at times, overestimated our ability to recruit and train a Iraqi defense force. And because of that, we had to deal with some serious security issues. We underestimated the sectarian violence. We've all acknowledged that.\n\nBut I believe in hindsight, one thing we could've done differently, more effective, would've been more aggressively backing the Iraqi government's processes, giving them time and space, understanding it's a longer-term mission, that rebuilding a nation doesn't happen in weeks or months, not even years necessarily, but building trust with the various factions in the country may take decades.\n\nOur military provided crucial support and leadership in the fight against Al Qaida in Iraq. Our response to the civil war following the withdrawal of our troops was effective. We set a timeline for timelines and we stuck by it.\n\nBut at the end of the day, my proudest achievement is the ability for Iraq's democracy to continue to age \u2013 they've had several fair, clean elections, functioning economic institutions. They're still a fragile democracy, but it's headed in the right direction.\n\nI think, as I said, in certain instances, better assessments, of the \u2013 better time-price estimations of how we went and also greater preparation to draw out near a eventual strategic would come out in years after."

Let me tell you, the Senate report you're referring to, I'm familiar with it, and I understand the concerns that some of my critics have raised. Now, I want to make it clear that our decision to liberate Iraq was not taken lightly. We had a very clear goal in mind: to disarm Saddam Hussein and to remove a threat, a serious threat, that he posed not only to the region but to the world.\n\nNow, with regards to the issue of Iranian influence, we didn't ignore warnings. In fact, I'm proud to say that we've taken a very aggressive stance against Iran's nuclear program. We believe that a nuclear proliferating Iran would be a serious threat to world peace and stability. But the notion that we somehow ignored warnings about Iraq giving opportunities to Al Qaida or Iran, that's just not accurate.\n\nI think it's fair to say that, yes, after the fall of Saddam Hussein, there were pockets of extremist elements who sought to exploit a power vacuum. But we've also had significant successes in disrupting terrorist networks and in helping to build a stable democracy in Iraq. And let me be clear, we will continue to work to deny Iran and all terrorists, all terrorist organizations, the opportunity to exploit the region.\n\nNow, I want to emphasize, the report you're talking about was a planner reasoning document, not an intelligence estimate. And it was one of many, many warnings and assessments we got about Iraq. And in the end, we made the right call. We took a historic opportunity to remove a brutal dictator, to liberate a country, and to spread the cause of freedom.\n\nAnd let me be clear, the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's regime was clear. He was a man who gassed his own people, who sponsored terrorists, who developed WMDs, who threatened the region. And I'm proud to have been a part of a decision-making process that removed him from power.\n\nLet's focus on what happened after we removed him. We've made significant progress, Iraq today is a better place.

It's no secret that there's been a lot of disagreement over the Attorney General's handling of certain matters, including the handling of the U.S. Attorneys and the wiretapping program. However, I've looked at the issue and I believe he's done a fine job in some of the most critical moments of our country's history.\n\nWhile it's true that there's been a no-confidence vote against him in the House, that's not a reflection on his ability to do the job. In fact, the Senate has twice confirmed him as Attorney General, which is a rigorous process. And I have every confidence in his ability to get the job done.\n\nNow, on the matter of taking counsel from Congress \u2013 I want to be very clear about this. My administration values the input of Congress, but we also have to make decisions based on the best interests of the country. In the case of Peter Pace and the JCS chairman position, I decided to seek the advice and counsel of the Joint Chiefs, the Secretary of Defense, and other defense experts. The decision to replace Peter Pace ultimately rested with me as Commander-in-Chief, based on my assessment of his leadership abilities and style.\n\nNow, with Alberto Gonzales, the decision to keep him in his position is a decision based on the President's authority, but it's also about an assessment of what's best for the country. We're facing a lot of challenges ahead, and I have every confidence in the Attorney General, his ability to work with Congress, and his dedication to upholding the law.\n\nI want to emphasize that my decision is guided not by partisanship, but by what's in the best interest of the country. And I'm not apologizing for that, let me make that clear. We will do what it takes to keep America safe and prosperous, that's our commitment."

As a president who's always believed in reducing the tax burden on American families, I would certainly consider suspending or rolling back the federal gasoline tax as part of a larger energy bill. However, we need to balance the national budget, and not suspend a tax that helps to fund critical infrastructure projects. Now I did sign the Kennedy-Lancaster amendment into law, and that gave the states the authority to reduce their gasoline taxes, which allowed the states to provide relief to their families.\n\nNow, let's talk about the price of gasoline. I understand that with the cost of crude oil rising, many Americans are feeling the pain of high gas prices. I'd like to remind the American people we've stated strength with our deterrent posture, stands forward on energy exploration, and new endeavors with our valued allies. Oil companies, like all businesses, are subject to the laws of supply and demand.

Let me respond to that by saying we have great respect for our European allies, and we appreciate their commitment to addressing the issue of climate change.\n\nNow, as it relates to the Kyoto treaty, I think it's unfair to say that we haven't taken action on climate change. We've implemented a robust and effective international partnership called the Major Economies Meeting (MEM) with Bangladesh, Brazil, China, the European Union, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, the United Kingdom and, of course, the United States. The MEM established specific goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We've also worked aggressively with our businesses and our states to reduce our emissions through initiatives like energy R&D and fuel efficiency standards.\n\nNow, regarding the ratification of the Kyoto treaty, I must remind you that the Clinton administration negotiated it, and they failed to submit it to the Senate for ratification. That makes it a bit tricky for subsequent administrations to effectively execute. Additionally, the treaty had some broad requirements, such as slashing emissions to 5% below 1990 levels for developed countries. Now, some experts have questioned whether these targets were realistic or achievable.\n\nAs for the EU nations not ratifying it fully, I think that relates to the same perceived inequity I'm talking about. That we were asked to reduce emissions 5%, while the transition countries were allowed to increase theirs by 10% above 1990 levels. If the Europeans are concerned about fairness in a global treaty, they should understand our position as well.\n\nAs for President Prodi, he represented the European European Commission, which seems to emphasize economy and liberation. President Prodi did make efforts to create the EU Common Position on Climate Change, a policy paper with core issues and designated solutions that helped propel belonging enforcement."

We're aware of the risks off the treatment of prisoners and the reprisals.\n\nThe Northern Alliance has made significant contributions to removing the Taliban regime, and they will play a key role in shaping Afghanistan's future.

Their program, or their, basic moderation depends on many variables, in their conduct, in their behaviors, in their governance. \n\nIn the days ahead, our focus will be on helping them build a different kind of government: a government that delivers prosperity, a government that promotes justice, a government that shows a thick respect for the rights of all Afghans.

Now, let me address this very complex issue, and I want to give you all the facts.\n\nFirst, I want to be clear: Saddam Hussein was a threat to the world, and his ties to Al Qaida were certainly one reason why we took military action. Now, I understand that the NIE, the National Intelligence Estimate, said \"low confidence\" that Saddam would cooperate with Al Qaida. But what I want to make clear is that Saddam's actions were nonspecific to Al Qaida alone. He had motive, means, and actually showed an intent to pursue ties with terrorist groups, including Al Qaida. In fact, we now know that Saddam's intelligence service, the Mukhabarat, and Al Qaida had met, talked, and were looking for ways to connect, ways to work together, to pursue a common goal of terrorism and chaos.\n\nNow, some say, \"But, Mr. President, where's the concrete evidence?\" I'd say that while the link may have been a tactical link, we can't ignore the historic and ideological links between Saddam and various officials of Al Qaida, and also the fact that these various independent reports and many worldwide witness accounts spoke of automatic ties at the administration of state level to Al Qaida affiliates.\n\nNow I want to steer back, actually remind you, it is universally acknowledged by every group and government watching this situation that in threat there was no proof but some signs usually fairly indicative.

And I've said all along that we had to take action to remove the threat of Saddam Hussein and the threat that he posed.\n\nNow, I know that the situation in Iraq is difficult, and I understand why people might be frustrated at the pace of progress. But I still believe that removing Saddam Hussein was the right decision. It's still the right decision today. I also believe that the longer that Saddam Hussein went unchecked, the more harm that he would have done.\n\nRegarding the issue of WMDs, I know that the intelligence was faulty, and I know that we've got to be careful in the way we use intelligence in the future. But let's not be naive about the threat that Saddam Hussein posed. We know that he had a history of using chemical and biological weapons against his own people and against his neighbors.\n\nSo, am I trying to say that America is safer today? Yes, I am. I believe that removing the threat of Saddam Hussein has made America safer. Now, I know that won't be convinced by me. I know that there are a number of people who have doubts. And I respect that.\n\nBut let me tell you, I'm committed to making decisions based on what I think is best for the country, and the country's national security. And that's what I did in this case.\n\n[pauses and looks around the room, clearing his throat]\n\nI'm willing to take the heat for the decisions I make, and I'm willing to answer the tough questions.

The vision I outlined earlier includes a free, democratic Iraq, an Iraq that will be at peace with its neighbors, an Iraq that will be a partner in the global war on terror. I truly believe, with the courage and determination of the Iraqi people, and our involvement as supporting allies\u2014the coalition, I truly believe we can achieve a free Iraq.\n\nNow, as to the time frame, I cannot give you an exact date when the mission is complete, but I can tell you, we're making good progress.  The recent elections in Iraq were a vital step towards that goal, and I believe that the Iraqis are assuming more and more responsibility for their own security.\n\nAs to the troops, their presence will be determined by the security situation on the ground.  When Iraq can stand on its own and take care of its own security, we will consider reducing our involvement, and eventually bringing our troops home."

Now, I've always been a straight shooter, I think there's been a lot of criticism of our intelligence agencies and the CIA and so forth, but I believe they did the best they could with the information they had at the time. As president, I made a decision based on the best intelligence available to me, and I still believe it was the right decision to make.\n\nHowever, I do think it's time for us to look forward, not dwell on the past. We're out of the Salem witches' court atmosphere in Washington, D.C. and it's time for us to focus on the challenges that we face today with regards to national security and the global war on terror. So, we will learn from the lessons of Iraq, and I'm a big believer in red-team exercises and that sort of thing, but we've got to keep moving forward, and not get bogged down in recriminations and finger-pointing.\n\nSo, to sum it up, mistakes were made, I've acknowledged that, but there was no intent to deceive.

The issue here is not about wanting to spy on our fellow citizens, but about stopping those who wish to do us harm.  With the post-September 11th world, this nation has worked tirelessly to communicate with international partners to prevent terrorist activity, including intelligence sharing that might prevent an attack.\n\nMonitoring communications for terrorist activity requires a different approach overseas due to different terrorist organizations and techniques than what is present here at home. When dealing with calls that can move across state lines, overseas lines, this is when the administration will use advanced technology and shared intelligence with other countries to keep our nation secure.\n\nYou see, turning a program like this onto every domestic-internal call amounts to overreaching executive authority and contradicts the notion of privacy and Fourth Amendment rights. We all know how strong Americans love their country, and we're not going to use surveillance techniques in America the way they would be highly conditionalized outside America's borders.\n\nThe President's job is, as I said to keep Americans secure and safe. The Democratic values of our nation won't be adversely altered in such actions."

Now, I know there are concerns about the Guard's role in homeland security, and I understand that we can't maintain a fighting force on the border 24/7. However, the Guard's mission has been to augment the Border Patrol and help reinforce their efforts. And from what I've seen, our soldiers have made a meaningful difference in helping stem the tide of people trying to cross the border illicitly.\n\nAs for their rotations, I've spoken to the Defense Department, and they're working on a plan to ensure that the Guard units are deployed for longer periods, but not so long that it wears down their readiness for the military's primary mission.\n\nAs for our legislative agenda on immigration reform, I'm getting frustrated, I'll be honest with you. I've made the case for a practical and compassionate approach, which includes border security, a guest-worker program, and a pathway to citizenship for certain illegals. But we still have some members of Congress, mostly in the House, who are refusing to budge.\n\nI'm not giving up on immigration reform. I still believe it's a critical issue, not just for our nation, but for our border states and our economy. The American people sent me a clear message in 2004, and that is we've got to fix our immigration system.\n\nNow, I'm willing to work with anyone who wants to get it done. But I'm not willing to throw in the towel and say, \"Well, we can't pass immigration reform this year, we'll try next year.\" I'm committed to finding a solution, and I'm committed to working with anyone who shares that vision, in both parties, to get the job done."

I appreciate the speculation, but I'm going to finish my term and serve the American people to the best of my ability.\n\nNow, regarding the state of the economy, I think it's been quite strong. We've seen some good economic numbers. We've created over 6 million jobs since I took office. The inflation rate is down. Interest rates are at historic lows. But I understand the concerns about energy prices. I understand the concerns about healthcare costs. These are challenges our nation faces, and we're working hard to address them.\n\nThe Treasury Secretary, Steve Snow... (pauses) I mean, Secretary Snow, is working hard to address these challenges. We're working hard, the whole administration is, to get our energy policies implemented, to make sure we're not beholden to foreign oil, to make sure Americans have access to affordable healthcare.\n\nNow, I know there are those who say, \"Well, you can't talk up a recovering economy when you're seeing rising prices.\" But the fact of the matter is, we're in a strong position. We're in a better position than most of the world. And I expect us to continue to create new opportunities for Americans, to create a stronger foundation for the future. And I'm optimistic about this economy.\n\nNow, I think it's worth noting, our economic numbers, they don't just measure economic growth; they measure the hope of the American people. They measure whether or not people believe in a better future. And I think the American people are optimistic about the future, and we'll continue to work hard to see that optimism made a reality.

I firmly believe that the decision to remove Saddam Hussein's regime from power was a necessary step in the war on terror and a necessary act to bring freedom and democracy to the people of Iraq. Now, I'm sure the Holy Father may have concerns about the handling of the war and the consequences of the war, and those are legitimate concerns.\n\nAs for his concerns, I took to heart his feelings about the human cost of war, and we worked together to make sure that the U.S. was doing everything it could to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population, particularly the children and the innocent. We've done a lot of work on administering aid and providing support to the Iraqi people, and I think that's an area where we can have a great partnership and working relationship.\n\nNow, with respect to the Prime Minister (meaning Tony Blair), I think it's mutually understood that we have a strong partnership on terrorism and counter-terrorism efforts. We discussed the various cases involving Americans detained here, and I'm pleased to report that we're making progress on resolving some of these issues."

I would rather not specify a specific date, but I think we need to get a decision, and we need to get it sooner rather than later.\n\nNow, I am concerned about... my concern for the people of Kosovo is clear. We are working closely with our European allies and other members of the U.N. to secure a resolution to the humanitarian crisis there. Regarding your question about Russia, I... our relations with Russia will be able to endure a variety of different actions, including this. However, it's worth noting that Russia's proposals have many flaws. Their missile defense proposal is flawed, does not address our need to protect our nation from missile threats, and we will evaluate it on its merits.\n\nNow, in an effort to improve U.S. - Russian relations and to avoid any kind of unnecessary escalation, I continue to believe and have proposed that we create a joint U.S.-Russian missile defense system in Central Asia.

Back in 2002, the majority of the 16 agencies said with moderate confidence that that was the case, not high. Still, the assessment said they were working to have nuclear weapons.\n\nNow, I do want to say that this last assessment, this latest assessment by the intelligence agencies, indicates that they do not have a reactor. My administration welcomed the resolution passed by the United Nations Security Council regarding Syria's compliance, and signal that Syria's collaboration in this regard is a welcome step. We look forward to working with international partners on this issue. The United States takes intelligence seriously, but we also believe in facts and evidence over assumptions. We'll continue to work with the international community on this matter."

It's caused by a combination of factors, including the high price of oil, which affects the entire world economy. The price of energy is a major factor. Now, as for what world leaders can do, we believe that using fiscal policy and monetary policy to stimulate economic growth would be beneficial. We also think that attractive and expanding business-friendly environments would create new opportunities for investment and job creation in both the United States and other developed and developing countries around the world.\n\nRegarding the value of the U.S. dollar, I'd say that we do not advocate for the U.S. dollar to devalue. However, I put the economy in the best shape of its history before the crisis started in 2007. We are now focusing on the international trade imbalances so that more nations will start to reduce their trade surpluses.\n\nRegarding climate change, we believe in research and development of new clean technologies and in addressing global warming in a fair and balanced approach. However, some folks call this 'global warming,' I call it 'climate change.' As you know, I decided not to participate in the Kyoto Accords and instead support negotiations for an international climate change treaty that does not unfairly harm the U.S. economy.\n\nWe think Americans should not be prohibited by big government to address pollution and keep the environment clean. So, it's our policy to reduce our greenhouse-gas emissions, while promoting economic growth."

One of the problems we've got is, you've got two entities that are helped along by the implicit guarantee of the federal government, and that's a double problem.  One, they are perceived to be higher risk, and because of that high perception they and consequently because of that, shareholders feel less incentive to increase capital to Freddie and Fannie.  Now the question is, will private capital be able to step in and provide capital.  And the short answer is I believe they could.  Now will they, that's a different story.\n\nThere are a number of very smart investors out there, private sector folks who can make some smart bets, smart decisions, and if the government puts them on notice and frees up their markets, they're quite willing to place a bet on these companies.  But it has to be done in a way that does not have the implicit guarantee of the federal government.  So my proposal was to limit that guarantee.  Take away some of the implicit backstops, and then we can re-evaluate whether or not it's wise for us to do long-term support for them in the mortgage market, or whether the private sector is willing to step in.\n\nNow if you want my take on it, this merits further evaluation.  It's not clear whether we should continue to stick our neck out, and implicitly guarantee there.  So I'd like to take it further, get the experts looking at the whole situation, all of the complexities of allowing for...

First, let me say that I've spoken with President Karzai, and I share his concerns about the threat posed by al-Qaida and its affiliates in the region. We've seen reports, just like you have, that suggest a redeployment of terrorist elements along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. It's a situation we're watching very closely, and we're working with Pakistan's new government to ensure that they understand the stakes and the imperative to take action against these terrorist organizations.\n\nRegarding President Karzai's comments about the Pakistani intelligence services, I don't think it's productive to get hung up on pointing fingers or making public accusations. What's important is that we work together to address the problem.  We've had some good meetings with General Musharraf and General Kayani, the new Chief of the Army Staff, and they understand the gravity of the threat and the need to deal with it.\n\nThat being said, I do believe that the new government in Pakistan has a unique opportunity to chart a new course and to work more closely with us and with the international community to root out the terrorists who use their soil as a sanctuary. The Pakistani government has publicly committed to taking action against the terrorist organizations, and we're seeing some signs of cooperation at the operational level.\n\nStill, we need to see more from the government in Pakistan. We need to see results. We need to see that they can deliver on their commitments to take decisive action against those who seek to harm us, our interests, and the people of Afghanistan. We'll be working closely with them and with the new government to ensure that we're on the same page and that we're all working together to achieve a common goal.\n\nNow, I know there's been some frustration in the region, and I understand that.

The American people expect us to be vigilant and proactive in protecting our nation and the freedom of our friends and allies.\n\nNow, as it relates to China, they're our friend, but I appreciate your skepticism about their level of engagement. The Communist Party leadership in Beijing has, at times, had a complicated relationship with Pyongyang. However, Secretary Rice, our administration, and the other members of the six-party talks have all reached out to China to seek their assistance in pressuring the North Koreans to return to negotiations.\n\nWhile we feel that China has an obligation to enforce some consequences for North Korea's non-compliance, we do recognize that Beijing's leverage is unique and can be invaluable in this region. Our goal remains to have China use its influence to push the North Koreans toward a resolution.\n\nWe believe that the joint statement of 2005 provides a clear framework for progress, but we also recognize that patience has its limits. So, while we do believe that a deadline is a tool to get the attention of the North Koreans, and by June we look for real progress toward a peaceful resolution."

We're dealing with a tough budget situation right now. The war on terror, the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and other ongoing priorities are going to cost us a lot of money. But that's no excuse for growing government so much.\n\nNow, I'm glad to see that we've made some progress in recent budget agreements. And I think it's a positive step. Still, I've made it clear that I'm willing to veto any legislation that doesn't meet my priorities on fiscal responsibility. I mean, we're talking about not just good government, but the fragile trust that the American people put in us to handle the nation's finances."

    "gen_response": "(chuckles) Well, first of all, let me just say that my relationship with John Howard, the Prime Minister of Australia, is indeed a close one. We've had the pleasure of working together extensively on various international issues, and I've always found him to be a sincere and like-minded individual who shares our commitment to freedom and democracy.\n\nAs for the chemistry, I think we just click, quite frankly. We've developed a strong rapport over the years, and we can speak very candidly with each other about the issues of the day. I have a lot of respect for his leadership and his stature on the world stage, and I think he's a trusted ally and friend.\n\nNow, as for your second question, I certainly believe in the importance of having a good working relationship with any leader, regardless of their party affiliation. That's why I've always made it a priority to reach out and build relationships with world leaders from different backgrounds and with different perspectives.\n\nIn Australia, I'm confident that we'll be able to work effectively with any future leader who succeeds Mr. Howard. Regardless of their party affiliation, the Australian government has long been an important partner for us in the region, and we value the strong bond between our two nations.\n\nI've had the pleasure of working with several leaders from both the Liberal and Labor parties in Australia, and I've always found them to be constructive and collaborative partners. We may have our differences, but on issues of mutual concern, we're able to find common ground and work together to advance our shared interests.\n\nSo, I'm confident that we'll continue to have a strong and productive relationship with Australia, no matter who the next leader may be."

    "gen_response": "(clears throat) Thank you, thank you.  The report that you're referring to, a report by Lancet, has been widely debated and scrutinized by many experts. While I appreciate the intentions of the experts involved, this study has yet to be peer-reviewed. I must emphasize that their methodology and data collection process have been challenged by some of the best minds in the field.\n\nAs you know, the estimate of 30,000 casualties was based on the most reliable information we had at the time, and it was a conservative estimate. The latest figure of 655,000 deaths presented in this report is, as I said, not confirmed.\n\nWe'll continue to work with experts to assess the accuracy of this report, but at this point, I still gotta tell you that I have my doubts about the methodology and conclusions drawn by this report. I want to emphasize that it's a tough and ongoing effort to bring stability to Iraq, and I will continue to examine the facts and make decisions based on the best available information.\n\n(laughs briefly) But I gotta tell you, it's also worth noting we released the Petraeus report last week, and it shows progress in Iraq. The security situation has improved, people are starting to live more like they used to. We've got an elected government in place. We got a ways to go, but I remain hopeful about the situation in Iraq."

I appreciate your coverage of this developing situation. \n\nLet me tell you, I'm very confident that South Korea, under the leadership of President Roh, will make the right decision. South Korea understands the threats from North Korea, and I think they will join the international community in supporting the sanctions that were passed by the United Nations. It's in their best interest, it's in our interest, and it's a critical tool in stopping the spread of nuclear proliferation.\n\nAs for China's involvement, I appreciate the cooperation they've shown so far. I've spoken to President Hu several times on this matter, and I'm optimistic that they'll continue to play a constructive role in pressuring the North Koreans to change their behavior.\n\nIf North Korea continues to thumb its nose at the world, there will be consequences. We've made it clear that armed aggression, provocative behavior, and a continued nuclear program will not be tolerated. I'm working closely with the international community to impose consequences, to reduce their access to resources and to demand that they disarm.\n\nMake no mistake, we're committed to preventing them from developing a nuclear capability, and we'll work tirelessly to ensure that doesn't happen."

Let me tell you, I've said it before and I'll say it again: the intelligence is being carefully evaluated and its accuracy reviewed by the experts at the CIA and other agencies. Now, I understand that, as we speak, we're under no illusions about the difficulties of dealing with the Iranian situation. \n\nWe believe that Iran's nuclear program is a serious concern, and we're going to continue working with our allies to insist on Iran's compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. We're working with the IAEA and other international agencies to monitor Iran's nuclear activities.\n\nNow, we're not going to repeat the mistakes of the past by making a case for war without having a clear picture of the situation on the ground. My administration, along with our allies, will make our decisions with the most informed and accurate intelligence available to us. We're committed to resolving this issue diplomatically, if it's possible. Led by the Secretary of State, we're involved in diplomatic efforts through the six-party talks to reach a peaceful solution.\n\nBut, I'm telling you, if Iran fails to comply with the terms of the Security Council resolutions, we will not hesitate to work with our allies to ensure that diplomatic efforts succeed. The international community will take this matter seriously. We're not going to be naive about Iran's intentions, and we'll act accordingly. I hope you understand that, and I appreciate your attention to this very serious issue."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, and thank you all for being here today. I want to address the concerns about the national security letters. Let me be clear: the primary goal of the USA PATRIOT Act and the powers it afforded our intelligence agencies was to protect America from the scourge of terrorism.\n\nAs you know, the 9/11 attacks were an unprecedented threat to our nation's security. We had to take swift and decisive action to protect our citizens, and that meant giving our intelligence agencies the tools they needed to combat terrorism.\n\nThe national security letters, as a tool, were meant to provide sensitive information to our agencies in a timely manner to prevent potential harm. While I understand that in some cases, these letters may have been misused, I want to assure the American people that this was not a widespread problem.\n\nNow, I also want to make it clear that we take allegations of any kind of misbehavior seriously, and we're working closely with congressional leaders to ensure that our intelligence agencies are operating within the bounds of the law.\n\nRegarding the use of these national security letters, I'd remind you that the number of instances where these letters were misused are relatively few in comparison to the number of letters issued. That being said, we are addressing these issues and upgrading our internal procedures to prevent any future misuses.\n\nNow, on the question of confidence in my cabinet members, particularly President Muellar and Attorney General Gonzales, I have confidence in both men. \nFBI Director Mueller and Attorney General Gonzales have been instrumental in keeping America safe in the five years since 9/11. I have faith in their integrity and commitment to upholding the law."

One area that concerns me is the issue of entitlement reform. Specifically, the long-term solvency of Medicare and Social Security. We've faced some significant challenges with these programs in the past, and I'm deeply concerned that if left unchecked, they pose a threat to the long-term financial stability of our nation.\n\nI believe my successor will have a tough decision on their hands - do they take steps to reform these programs and face the music, or do they punt to a later administration? I think it's a critical decision, and one that requires careful consideration. I urge my successor to tackle these challenges head-on and make the tough decisions necessary to ensure that these programs are there for future generations.\n\nNow, I know there are different ideas about how to approach it, and I respect those differences of opinion. But I believe that's what the presidency is all about - making tough decisions, taking bold action, and standing up for what you believe in. So, I would encourage my successor to approach these challenges with a spirit of leadership and a commitment to getting it done, rather than kicking the can down the road.\n\nThat being said, I'm proud of what we've accomplished while I've been in office, and I believe we've taken significant steps towards addressing this issue. But I know that the work is far from over, and I'm confident that my successor will continue to build on those efforts. Thank you."

We will indeed be represented at this conference, and I'm pleased to announce that Deputy Secretary of State, Ambassador John Negroponte, will lead our delegation.\n\nWe're committed to engaging with the international community on the important issue of combating racism and promoting diversity, tolerance, and human rights. We recognize that this conference presents an opportunity to reaffirm our shared commitment to eradicating racism and promoting peaceful coexistence among cultures.\n\nRegarding the specific issues you mentioned, we have concerns about certain agenda items, including those related to Zionism and reparations. While we value our strong alliance with Israel and are committed to ensuring that criticism of Zionism is not employed to demonize or delegitimize Israel, we're worried about provisions that go beyond promoting the elimination of racism and instead foster intolerance.\n\nAs for the issue of reparations, we need to carefully consider how such discussions are framed and whether they are productive in promoting true reconciliation and progress. Many witnesses, including some of these countries, have acknowledged that their treatment of minority populations was nasty."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you.  That's a thoughtful question, and one that I've encouraged my advisors to reflect upon. The capture of Saddam Hussein is a significant milestone in the operation in Iraq.  We're hopeful that this will help bring a measure of closure not only to the Iraqi people, but also to the nations that do believe that Saddam Hussein was a threat to global security and prosperity.\n\nThat being said, I understand that there are differences in opinion regarding the Iraq war.  However, I firmly believe that the ultimate determinant of success will be the stability and security that we bring to the people of Iraq.  If we're successful in providing a stable, secure, and democratic future for the Iraqi people, I believe it will have a profound impact on the region and on the world.\n\nMake no mistake about it, we're not naive to the divisions that we see today.  We know there are those that oppose our efforts in Iraq, and we understand their concerns.  However, I believe that history will judge our decision to disarm Saddam Hussein of his weapons of mass destruction and free the Iraqi people from his brutal rule as a crucial step forward in the global fight against tyranny and extremism.\n\nIn the end, this is about more than just one issue or one country.  It's about our values, our principles, and our commitment to peace, freedom, and justice.  And I have confidence that for those who believe in these things, the capture of Saddam Hussein will be seen as a significant step towards a brighter future."

    "gen_response": "I appreciate your question. First of all, I want to say that I'm proud of the progress we've made in Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein. We've had a free election, a constitutional referendum, and now a government that was chosen by the Iraqi people. That's a remarkable achievement and we're committed to supporting them in their efforts to build a stable and secure nation.\n\nNow, the situation on the ground is complex and difficult. There are still terrorists who want to undermine the progress that has been made. We've seen some sectarian violence, and that's troublesome. But I don't think the insurgency is gaining strength and becoming more lethal, I think it's just a different kind of fight. The enemy has adapted, and so have we. We've increased our troop presence, and we're working with the Iraqis to build up their security forces.\n\nAs for the Iraqi government, I have confidence in Prime Minister Maliki and the other leaders of the new government. They understand the challenges they face and the stakes involved. We're working closely with them to help them build up their security forces, to build infrastructure, and to promote economic development. It's a tough job, but I think they're up to the challenge.\n\nWe'll continue to do our part to help the Iraqis achieve their goal of a stable and secure country. And I laid out a plan for withdrawal in my address to the nation last night, where I mentioned this summer would see the, began the return of our combat troops to this country."

Now that they've made their ruling, we will begin moving forward with the process of closing the detention center at Guantanamo Bay.\n\nWe've said all along that the facility at Guantanamo was a temporary solution, a necessary solution, but temporary. We didn't create it with the intention of having it as a permanent place for detainees. And so, we're going to work with the Congress to find an alternative that ensures that the United States is able to safely detain and prosecute those individuals who are a threat to our security, while also upholding our values and our Constitution.\n\nRegarding the detainees that you mentioned, those who pose a threat to our security \u2013 the hard-core terrorists, the ones who are deemed too dangerous to be released or sent home \u2013 we will have to make sure that we're able to hold them in a secure manner. We've got to make sure that they're not released to cause harm to our country or to innocent people around the world.\n\nOne of the options we're considering is a facility here in the United States, a place where we can ensure that these detainees are held in a way that's consistent with our laws and our values. We're also going to work with Congress to see if there's a way to create a new law that would permit the detention of these individuals for the duration of the war on terror.\n\nWe value our Constitution and our system of justice. We will work to find a way to ensure that we can detain and prosecute these terrorists in a way that's consistent with those values."

    "gen_response": "That's a valid question, I appreciate that. Let me be clear: my phrase 'axis of evil' referred to the stands of those nations who harbor terrorism, sponsor terrorism, and seek to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction. Both Iran and Syria fall into that category.\n\nThat being said, if such a scenario presented itself where Iran or Syria were willing to work with us to stabilize Iraq, or root out terrorist organizations like al-Qaeda and Hezbollah that operate in their territories, then we would be willing to engage with them in a constructive dialogue.\n\nHowever, I want to make it clear that any kind of engagement would be conditional upon Iran and Syria meeting certain standards. We expect them to demonstrate their commitment to democracy, human rights, and non-proliferation of WMDs. If they can prove that they're willing to move in that direction, we would be willing to consider cooperation on a limited basis.\n\nNow, I know some may say that's a bit of a catch-22, that we're asking them to change their behavior in order to get their cooperation, but I can tell you that's not an unsustainable policy. We're not under any illusions that we're going to suddenly start handing out participation prizes to countries that have supported terrorism in the past. But at the same time, I don't think it's unrealistic to expect that the international community can find ways to work together, even with those with whom we disagree."

We made significant progress on Social Security reform, and I'm proud of our efforts.  We were able to pass a tax relief package in 2001, which was a major priority, and helped spur economic growth. And as for immigration reform, I understand that we were unable to reach a consensus on a comprehensive package, but we did pass a major bill to secure our borders and improve national security.\n\nRegarding divided government, you're right that it did work in the 1990s, and I believe it can work again. However, I also believe that the key to success in the absence of a unified government is honest, forthright, partisan leadership. When I took office, I made clear that I was willing to work with Democrats on our shared goals, but also made it clear that we would not compromise on core principles of our agenda.\n\nNow, I believe there may be opportunities for common ground with the new Democratic leaders, I'm willing to work with them to achieve bipartisan consensus, but I also must inform you that there are fundamental differences between our parties on many issues.\n\nI'd like to say this: social security, tax code overhaul, and immigration reform are all issues that can be tackled, if and when, we can find common ground on the principles. The challenge is however, that the issue of immigration reform remains high on my agenda even after leaving office."

It shows that we're committed to making sure that our government serves the rule of law and upholds the trust that the American people have placed in us.\n\nThe facts of this situation are still before us.

I'm confident in his ability to do so.\n\nAs to his ability to work with Congress, I believe that when he appears before the Judiciary Committee, he'll have an opportunity to explain these mistakes and show how he intends to move forward. I believe he has a strong track record of public service and I have every confidence that he'll be able to work effectively with members of Congress.\n\nBut ultimately, my confidence isn't as important as the American people's confidence in the Justice Department.

The Pakistani people have demonstrated their desire for democracy and accountability with the results of these elections. It's a pivotal moment, and it's now up to General Musharraf and the Pakistani government to respect the will of the people and ensure a smooth transition.\n\nAs for his role in the fight against terrorism, I've made it clear that Pakistan has been a critical partner in this effort. General Musharraf has acknowledged the terrorist threat that his country faces, and our two nations have worked closely together to stem the flow of terrorists along the Afghan border. While our relationship has had its ups and downs, I appreciate General Musharraf's efforts to move against extremist groups.

But let me tell you, our alliance is one of the strongest and enduring relationships we've got in the world.  It's built on shared values, shared interests, shared aspirations for peace, and a deep commitment to democracy and freedom. \n\nNow, in terms of the policy differences we've had, I believe that Philip Rudd's new government's position, even though it does differ from our own is not so different from our own that it would damage the relationship.  On Iraq, for example, I know that the Australians have had their own experiences in the conflict. I believe that our approaches share a common goal of stabilizing Iraq.  Now, I believe that we do differ on the climate change issue, and we could disagree with the approach they've proposed to dealing with the Kyoto Protocol.  But that notwithstanding, the nature of our relationship is not tied to one particular piece of legislation or one policy initiative. \n\nAs far as China is concerned, the Americans and the Australians have long had a shared sense of purpose when it comes to promoting a stable and peaceful rise of China.  Now, I acknowledge that some of the differences in policy may catch us off guard, but we still are aligned on the long-term goals that we want to achieve with China.\n\nI'd like to echo what our Ambassador-here-Constandinos Papandoniou said that the friendship cannot be seen as a partnership of people with exactly alike interests and ambitions but should be seen as a partnership sharing coordination between two nations with interests that weren't identical yet complementary."

We've been through a difficult process to get to the point where we are today, and I strongly believe that compromising and coming to an agreement is an important step in the right direction for the region, for our country, and for the safety and security of the free world.\n\nNow, critics of this deal, including some of my own advisors, have expressed concerns, and I understand their worries. I understand why they might think that giving up on some of our desired outcomes could be seen as giving in to North Korea's demands. But the facts are that we've negotiated a critical agreement, which involves the destruction of North Korea's nuclear program, denuclearization efforts, passage of the ultimate inspections, the dismantling of their chemical and biological facilities, information for military Armored division conformity and potentially entry into CTBT or reinstatement. The proof is, however, in the pudding, and I've assembled a commission to fully involuntary supervise and verify the steps we have agreed too.\n\nI would like you to consider the big picture here. Do you realize in the long-term mentality, members, that what we're asking of Turkey and the defvature full nuclear away requirements, that isn't that would be fatally tied to Duma policy? However the alterative to pursuing this negotiated approach we have is conflict, and that would come with astronomical costs and far too many casualties.

Let me tell you, my primary concern has always been and will always be the American people. \n\nThe measures we've put in place to roll back some of the previous health and safety regulations are designed to promote economic growth and to unleash the power of the American free market. We're confident that these changes will create jobs, increase domestic production, and ultimately, make America more competitive in the global economy.\n\nNow, I know there's been a concern that our actions are driven by corporate donors, but let me tell you, my friends, I didn't become president to serve the special interests. I became president to serve the American people. We've had a thorough examination of the regulations on the books and found that many of them were outdated, burdensome, and ineffective.\n\nWith regard to health and safety, I want to assure you that we're not compromising on the well-being of the American people. In fact, we're confident that by streamlining these regulations, we're actually creating a more efficient and effective process for the protection of our citizens.\n\nAs for what else we might repeal, I'd say we're taking a comprehensive look at the regulatory landscape and making changes where we believe it makes sense. We're not driven by one particular agenda or ideology; we're driven by the desire to create a more free, more prosperous, and more energetic American economy. Specifics will be forthcoming in the coming weeks and months.\n\nNow, I'd like to clarify, some of the rules we're looking at have been in place since the 1970s. They've been long overdue for an update, in our opinion. The rule of law is a cornerstone of our democracy, and my great admirer, Ronald Reagan, once noted that the biggest worry in a climate where your casual gamma work evidently infiltrates our highest chamber is [[smiling broad] 'if we can remove dumb rules.'

Here's a rewritten version, delivered in a more formal and professional tone:\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I appreciate your question and I want to address the concerns you've raised about our approach to regulatory reforms. Our administration is committed to promoting economic growth, job creation, and a more competitive business environment. We believe that by streamlining and updating outdated regulations, we can encourage innovation, reduce bureaucratic red tape, and make it easier for businesses to thrive.\n\nWhile we understand that some of these changes may be interpreted as rollbacks of previous health and safety measures, we want to assure the American people that our primary concern is their safety and well-being. We're committed to upholding the highest standards of protection for all Americans, while also recognizing the importance of business growth and competitiveness.\n\nWe've taken a thorough examination of the regulations on the books, and in some cases, we've found that they're outdated, burdensome, or ineffective. We're streamlining these regulations to make it easier for businesses to operate and for people to start new ventures. This approach will create new opportunities for growth, innovation, and job creation.\n\nNow, we know there are concerns that our actions may be driven by special interests or corporate donors. I want to assure you, as I've said before, that our decisions are guided by a commitment to serve the American people. We're taking a comprehensive look at the regulatory landscape, and we'll make changes where it makes sense to do so.\n\nAs for what else we might repeal, we'll be evaluating a"

    "gen_response": "Thank you for your question, and I appreciate your service to our country.\n\nYou know, I've given a lot of thought to the situation in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the role that our troops are playing there. As Commander-in-Chief, my primary concern is the safety and well-being of our brave men and women serving overseas. And I'm pleased to say that their efforts are making a difference.\n\nAs for the phase of the war you're referring to, I've been briefed extensively on the strategy and the risks involved. We're taking a multi-faceted approach to support the new governments in both Iraq and Afghanistan, including military advisers, economic aid, and diplomatic efforts. Our analysts assess that the chances of direct conflict escalating is low, but we're prepared for any eventuality.\n\nYou know, as a nation, we cannot turn our backs on people who are suffering under tyranny, or faced with the threat of terrorism. So, as Commander-in-Chief, I will continue to take the necessary steps to ensure the safety of our troops while we pursue these objectives.\n\nI think about the sacrifices made by the Vietnam generation, as you mentioned, and I remember the tough decisions made by leaders in the past. But, this next phase of the campaign is a very different situation. The stakes are real, the threats are real, and our role is clear: to support free nations, defeat terrorism, and promote stability in the region.\n\nWe're looking to build sustainable, vetted security forces in both countries, and partner with local leaders to ensure that the countries transition into democratic governments. And, of course, we're taking all necessary precautions to ensure that our military advisers are deployed safely and effectively.\n\nSo, to your question, we're going into these situations with careful consideration, but we will not shy away from the challenges ahead. We will face them directly, with resolve, and with a strong commitment to the values that we hold true: freedom, justice, and peace."

    "gen_response": "Ladies and gentlemen of the press, I appreciate your question. Let me assure you that the United States is committed to a diplomatic approach to resolving the North Korea issue, but I've also made it clear that we will not negotiate at the barrel of a gun. We will not be blackmailed or intimidated by North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons. \n\nRegarding the proposal put forth by North Korea, which he calls the \"Sunshine Policy,\" I have expressed my concerns that it falls short of our expectations in terms of verifiable and enforced disarmament. The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is a non-negotiable condition for any talks with North Korea. Our concerns are grave about the risks of proliferation in the region and the potential for North Korea to transfer nuclear technology to other terrorist organisations, or even rogue states such as Iran. So, while dialogue is desired and necessary, it is impossible for us to enter any negotiations with North Korea that may compromise the stability of the region or our national security.\n\nNow, I'd be remiss if I didn't hear President Jiang's thoughts on this matter. President Jiang, do you wish to share your views on the situation with North Korea's nuclear program?"

    "gen_response": "Thank you for that question.  I appreciate the query on Putin and our discussions. You'll recall that I highlighted the importance of Russia not providing nuclear technology to Iran. In our conversations, I expressed my deep concern about Iran's nuclear intentions, and we discussed specific steps they could take to adhere to Non-Proliferation Treaty responsibilities. While I wouldn't characterize it as a formal commitment, I believe there was a clear understanding on both sides that this is a concern for the international community. We'll continue working to address this issue.\n\nAs for Russia and our discussions regarding involvement in Iraq, I appreciate President Putin's willingness to engage on this crucial issue. The President has made it clear that Russia stands firmly against the spread of nuclear proliferation in the region, but I must correct you - Russia has not made any military commitment to contribute troops in Iraq. However, Secretary-General Kofi Annan did make an important point that any future contributions, whether by Russia or any other country, are contingent on fulfilling Security Council resolutions relating to Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. In our discussions with President Putin, we did talk about methods in which Russia might play a constructive role in international efforts in Iraq long-term."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for asking. I think there's been a misunderstanding about the nature of this initiative. This is not just about the United States forcing our will on the Middle East or your traditional allies in the region. This is an effort to bring people together, to create a strategic framework that will enhance stability in the Middle East.\n\nNow, I do appreciate their concerns, and I respect their right to consider their own interests and their own relationships with neighboring countries. I've had conversations with various leaders in the region, including the King and Crown Prince in Saudi Arabia, who share a lot of our concerns about the challenges we're facing in the region.\n\nI don't take it personally that they're not sending representatives to this summit. I'm more interested in results than symbolism. We're going to continue to work with those countries, with leaders who are committed to peace, who are committed to stability, who are committed to democracy in their own countries. And we'll get the job done, because that's what we've got to do for the American people.\n\nNow, the fact remains that nations like Jordan, like Bahrain, like the United Arab Emirates, are participating in this effort, and I'm hopeful that others will see the value in it and join us in the future. But we won't let the absence of any particular country deter us from achieving our goal of a more peaceful, more prosperous, and more free Middle East."

We've made significant progress in our discussions on energy, trade, and non-proliferation, and I'm confident that the agreements we've made will benefit not just the G-8 nations, but the world at large.\n\nIn terms of logistics and facilities, I'm proud to say that the staff and our military personnel have done an outstanding job of ensuring that the summit has been conducted in a secure and efficient manner. We've made sure that all necessary measures are in place to protect the leaders and their delegates, and that the local community has been treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.\n\nNow, I know we've had some concerns about the hurricane, but I'm pleased to report that we've been working closely with state and local authorities to ensure that Georgia is prepared for any potential threats. We're taking this storm very seriously, and I want to assure the American people that we'll do everything in our power to protect this great state and its people.\n\nAnd Sonny, I appreciate your observation about the region. The state of Georgia has been an outstanding host, and I'm proud to represent this great nation in such a beautiful place."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question, I appreciate the focus on a critical issue like North Korea. I do believe the six-party talks are a useful diplomatic tool to achieve our objectives. As you know, our goal is a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, and I'm not satisfied that we've made the progress I would have liked. However, these talks have given our nation a seat at the table with the other five parties involved in this issue.\n\nWe've seen some movement, but we're not making the progress we'd like, obviously. Ambassador Christopher Hill and his team have worked diligently to bring these parties together to discuss denuclearization, disarmament, and concrete actions to verify and ensure the North's compliance.\n\nNow, the continued threats from North Korea are a concern, and we take those threats very seriously. Our understanding is that while they have made some steps regarding the nuclear issue, it appears their nuclear program is advancing. This situation is complex, and there's a lot of misleading information coming from the regime in Pyongyang.\n\nThe bottom line is this: our policy remains unchanged. We want a denuclearized North Korea, and we will not unilateral concede to the regime's actions or inaction on that goal. We're staying engaged in these talks with the understanding that action, not just declarations, is what will bring us to a solution.\n\nWhether we'll go to the U.N. to address this situation is something we're carefully evaluating. We prefer to exhaust all diplomatic avenues before considering that course of action. Nonetheless, our commitment to the peace and security of Asia, and our concern for the safety and security of the world are unwavering.\n\nWe're determined to engage thoughtfully, to bringing this issue to a favorable conclusion, whether through continued dialogue or other means if North Korea refuses to cooperate. The spread of nuclear weapons in our world is a threat we will not ignore."

    "gen_response": "My fellow Americans and members of the press.  You're right to question the intelligence and the subsequent policy decisions my administration has made. I want to assure you that we've been open and transparent about the fact that Iraq's WMD programs were not as robust as we initially thought. We've learned from this experience and we're working hard to ensure that we have the best intelligence possible to inform our foreign policy and national security decisions.\n\nNow, with regard to Iran, let me be clear: we have reason to believe that the Iranian regime is working on a nuclear program, and that's a grave concern for the United States and the international community. We have been speaking with our allies and partners to address this issue through diplomacy, but we will not rule out the possibility of other options if the situation warrants it.\n\nRegarding the impact on other potential threats like North Korea, I believe that the Deferred North Korea Agreements have actually shown the power of decisive action and multilateral diplomacy.  Working together with our international allies, we were able to snap sanctions back into place when North Korea violated the terms of the agreement.  Intelligence, however, is always a key component to any foreign policy decision.  We're working to improve our intelligence gathering in various hotspots, including Iran and North Korea.\n\nHowever, I reject the notion that the Iraq experience will severely limit our ability to address future threats.  The bottom line is that we will continue to gather and analyze intelligence, consult with our allies and partners, and use all the tools at our disposal to protect America from any and all threats."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, [press name], for your question. As the Commander-in-Chief, my concern for the safety and well-being of our troops and our efforts to combat terrorism never wavers. However, I understand the gravity of the situation surrounding the events at Guantanamo.\n\nThe recent suicides at Guantanamo are indeed a deeply disturbing incident, and I'm troubled by the implications that they raise. We're conducting a thorough investigation to determine the facts and circumstances surrounding these events, and I want to assure the American people that we're taking all necessary steps to ensure the safety and security of our personnel and detention facilities.\n\nAs for the U.S. image abroad, it's clear that the actions committed by some who identify as members of our military have caused significant damage to that image. I've expressed my disgust and disappointment with the abuse and mistreatment of detainees at Abu Ghraib, and I've made it clear that those actions are not representative of the values and principles of the United States.\n\nHowever, I strongly believe that closing Guantanamo would be a mistake at this time. This facility serves a critical purpose in our efforts to combat global terrorism by detaining and interrogating individuals who have been deemed a threat to our national security. These detainees have been captured on the battlefield, often providing valiant service to our enemies. While we must always conduct ourselves in accordance with our values and our laws, the reality is that these individuals are a menace to our safety and the world at large.\n\nNow, let me be clear: I know that some have called for closing Gitmo, or related facilities, claiming that it's perceived as a stain on national honor. But, I'd respond by saying the issue isn't the place, it's how we strive to maintain our values. And instead of sidestepping tough issues, we should focus on applying our values to them, whether it's providing moral guidance for our military overseas or dealing with hard realities at home, so when information like haditha received national attention."

However, I've got to tell you, I believe in my responsibility to act on behalf of the American people. That being said, my Administration will carefully review the decision, and I am open to reevaluating our procedures to ensure we're conducting the business of the executive branch in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution. It's a reminder, though, that the ultimate responsibility of the Executive Branch remains with the President, and the consequences of those decisions fall on his shoulders as well."

    "gen_response": "Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate your question. As you know, our primary goal in Iraq was to defeat the regime of Saddam Hussein and bring an end to the threat that he posed to the world. We planned the operation with precision and thoroughness, after carefully considering various scenarios.\n\nOur initial timeframe for this operation was based on a range of considerations, not merely because of a casual decision to let the military operation play out to its natural end. The facts on the ground changed as the operation progressed, with Saddam's regime crumbling faster than anticipated. I authorized our commanders to take advantage of the momentum on the ground. We didn't predict the swift collapse of the Iraqi military and the subsequent exodus of Iraqi forces from Baghdad and other cities.\n\nIn retrospect, in hindsight, I firmly believed and still believe that the course of action we took was the right one. The conditions for a ceasefire were difficult to achieve in the chaos that followed Saddam's downfall. Now, in this post-Saddam environment, we are working to create a cease-fire and a peaceful, free Iraq.\n\nWe will not create a situation that lets a terrorist state or entity stand in the shadows anymore. Instead, our nation will stay focused on the unfolding situation on the ground and on than the stakes involved in Iraq's future and it's people lives. We must help build that future, that is why our commitment there will not waver and why we will make sure the government in power there after will never ever again harbor terrorism."

However, I must reiterate that this matter is an ongoing investigation, and I'm not at liberty to comment on the specific circumstances surrounding the destruction of the CIA interrogation tapes.\n\nThat being said, I do want to emphasize that our government has taken strong actions to protect our nation from the threat of terrorism. The tactics that have been employed are designed to ensure the security of the American people. Our strategy has been tailored to combat and defeat the terrorist enemy, and I'm confident in the actions taken by the professionals in the intelligence community.\n\nThe struggle against ideology is a long-term challenge that requires steady and relentless resolve. We face two old adversaries in the Cold War and two new and emerging ones in a new breed of global terrorism. My administration has taken very serious steps to tackle these threats.\n\nWe're not naive, and we're not confused about the dangers of terrorism. I believe our policies, though sometimes criticized, have made America safer. The tactics of interrogation, the use of intelligence, and our counter-terrorism operations have been effective against known and emerging threats."

Let me tell you, I understand the concerns that some of my fellow conservatives have about the price tag. $700 billion is a big number, and I don't like big numbers either. But I also believe that at this point, something had to be done to rescue our financial system. I mean, we were on the brink of a complete collapse, and I'm not talking just about the financial markets; I'm talking about the American people, their savings, their jobs, their retirement investments. So, I made a judgment that this was a necessary step.\n\nNow, I can understand why some of my fellow conservatives are concerned. I'll tell you, I've been briefed by Secretary Paulson, and I've had discussions with leaders on the Hill. We've made it clear that the stopgap measure, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, is a bridge to getting our economy back on track. It's not a blank check. It's a critical step. And I've made it clear to the Speaker and the Senate leaders that there should be no extraneous spending in this legislation. It's a narrow focus on stabilizing our financial markets.\n\nNow, I'm a conventionally conservative, and I know some of my fellow conservatives are too. We want to see robust oversight, and I agree with that. I think there should be a strong Inspector General to oversee the program, robust accounting, all those things. We'll work with Congress to make sure that the taxpayer's money is used as intended. And let me assure you, I'll be keeping a very close eye on this.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I've got confidence in the team we've put together, and I've got confidence that we can get this done in a way that protects the taxpayers and gets our economy back on track."

My administration has, in fact, been engaged in efforts to promote a peaceful resolution to this longstanding conflict, but we believe that it would be most effectively carried out through continued diplomacy between the two nations themselves.\n\nWe have encouraged both India and Pakistan to work together to reduce tensions and to engage in dialogue that addresses the concerns and aspirations of their respective people.  And I can tell you that our ambassador to the U.N., Ambassador Negroponte, has consulted and worked closely with both governments to try to facilitate progress towards a peaceful resolution.\n\nSo, while the United States is and will continue to remain engaged in this issue, we cannot impose a solution on either India or Pakistan. Ultimately, this must be a matter for the two parties to resolve amongst themselves. We believe that a peaceful and lasting resolution can only be achieved through a process of bilateral engagement and dialogue, in a spirit of respect for the principles of self-determination and territorial integrity.\n\nIn short, we'll continue to work with both parties to promote a peaceful resolution, consistent with the principles of the U.N. Charter. Thank you."

Of course, I had investments in Harken Energy, as you know. Sharon Pratt's about the one about that decision I made. I said, if there's something I've done that violates the law, I implore people to let justice take its course. \n\n As for the matter involving the SEC, I'll tell you this - I know the lawyers, they've reviewed this thoroughly, they've gone over everything, I mean everything, that's on the table there.

But I've always been guided by my deep-seated faith in the American people, and my confidence in our military and our coalition partners. I firmly believe that the removal of Saddam Hussein from power will bring freedom to the Iraqi people and make the world a safer place.\n\nI'm willing to take a hard look at the consequences of our actions, but I'm also convinced that our morally and strategically we are doing the right thing. Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, a proliferator of WMDs. He's been a terror-sponsor for years. We had the duty to stop him.\n\nCan we guarantee the outcome? No, we can't guarantee the outcome. But I do know one thing: if we don't act, and Saddam Hussein stays in power, then the consequence of that will be catastrophic."

    "gen_response": "That's a fair question, and I'm happy to answer. Let me tell you, our goal in Iraq has always been to create a free and democratic Iraq that can govern itself. And as we've worked towards that goal, we've supported individuals who share that vision.\n\nIt's true that some of the Iraqi exiles who have been involved in the transition government have received funding from various sources, including the United States. But let me be clear: this funding was not designed to create a puppet government. It was designed to support those individuals who share our values and our commitment to democracy.\n\nThe United States has given billions of dollars to aid the people of Iraq to combat terrorism, rebuild their infrastructure, and provide humanitarian assistance. Any funding that has gone to individuals has been transparent, accountable, and designed to help them build a better future for Iraq.\n\nNow, I understand that some critics will continue to make skeptical claims about our intentions. But I would say to them: look at the record. The Iraqi people are taking charge of their own government, and it's not a puppet government of the United States. It's a sovereign government of Iraqis, by Iraqis, for Iraqis.\n\nWe will continue to support the democratic process in Iraq because we believe that freedom and democracy are the best hope for a peaceful and prosperous Iraq. And we'll continue to work with the Iraqi people to build a government that represents the will of its people, not just our interests.\n\nSo, to those critics who say that we're trying to create a puppet government, I say: that's just not true. We're supporting a democratic revolution in Iraq, and we're proud of the progress they're making."

And the American people elected me, our Republican majority in the House and Senate, based on our commitment to limited government, lower taxes, and a safer America.

It's either we succeed in Iraq, or we -- we can't succeed. And I think that a precipitous withdrawal would be a disaster. I understand that some Americans, and some members of Congress, have different views on this, and that's okay. That's the debate we're supposed to have.\n\nNow, I'm not naive. I know that in the heat of politics, sometimes emotions get in the way, and some folks say, \"We can just leave, it's not going well, we can just get out.\" I respect that opinion, but I believe that opinion is wrong.\n\nNow, I do believe that -- and I've said this before -- that we should work with those Democrats who share our objective of defeating al-Qaeda in Iraq and the extremist groups who are threatening our nation's security. We have a common goal, but we're not seeing eye to eye on how we get there. And I'd be happy to sit down with the Speaker of the House or the Senate Minority Leader and work out a plan, if we can find common ground.\n\nAs for what I can do to make that happen, I think it's simple. Lead by example. I've been doing it for a long time, and I will continue to do it. I'll share my vision with Congress, and I'll work with members of both parties to find common ground. We'll need to have tough dialogue, and to work through our differences.\n\nAnd I'll tell you this: I won't let partisanship get in the way of doing what's right for the American people. I believe that's not just my responsibility, but a responsibility of all leaders to transcend the partisanship and do what's in the best interest of the country.\n\nNow, it's time for the Congress to join me in this effort. And I think there are many Democrats out there who want to do just that."

Let's just say that the security situation in a war zone is always evolving and we take all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of myself, my staff, and the Iraqi officials we are meeting."

Indeed, the situation with North Korea is a very serious one, and it poses a significant threat not only to the people of the region, but to global stability. We are carefully considering our options and working with our partners around the world to address this challenge.\n\nAs to your question on sanctions, I agree we should continue to consider meaningful penalties against North Korea for its persistent flouting of international obligations and resolutions respecting its nuclear and ballistic missile activities. The latest developments in their nuclear program pose a grave threat not just to the Asia-Pacific region, but to our friends and allies around the world.\n\nRegarding the Russian and Chinese positions, we're having very frank discussions with both nations. We're utilized the effectiveness and efficiency throughout my administration to prevail in getting multiple countries to be on the same side of the fence. I always believed that working collectively with your allies is better and serves as perhaps a hallmark to negotiations, our strategy centers on we work together- the diplomatic route, strong on economic and political reforms coupled with working very closely and sharing in knowledge- all hus this does comprise of generally will be convincing enough to bring the Chinese, Russians on board, I have also come to believe North Korea realizes that strong unified diplomacy all dictates that non-conflict support solutions provide ample opportunity to reject options."

We'll continue to bring our enemies to justice, and we won't let the actions of a terrorist organization dictate the outcome of an election in America. \n\nBut let me be blunt, this Democtatic victory in the Connecticut primary, and any other state where we didn't get our candidate selected-- my view has always been, and will always be, that the US government will do what is necessary to keep the American people safe."

We've worked closely together on this issue. We're like-minded, as you might expect, on the need to protect our people from missile threats.\n\nNow, regarding the specific issue of building missile defense sites in the UK, I've asked our Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, to work closely with the British Ministry of Defense to examine the possibilities for locating a missile defense site in the UK.

The policy of our administration regarding missile defense is clear: we are identifying and addressing the threat posed by rogue states with ballistic missile capabilities. We will continue to explore and develop a missile defense system that will protect the American people, and that is within the framework of the ABM Treaty. However, we will not be limited by this treaty if it restricts our ability to defend ourselves.\n\nWe'll continue to work closely with our allies in NATO and the European Union to build a cooperative approach to addressing missile defense. We believe it's a shared interest of many nations, and we've made significant progress in establishing a global consensus on this issue.\n\nWe do not believe that we need to unilaterally abandon the ABM Treaty in order to move forward. In fact, we will conform to its spirit, even if we need to clarify certain aspects that affect our modernization efforts.\n\nBut let me be clear: the security of the American people will be our number-one priority. If the terms of the ABM Treaty or any potential agreement restrict our ability to ensure their security, I will not hesitate to make changes. The protection of this great nation is not negotiable.

Now, you asked how we're going to get him to where we want him to be, and I want to be clear: we want him dead or alive.\n\nYou know, we're using a variety of intelligence assets, a variety of military forces on the ground, and we're working closely with our Pakistani friends to try to track him down.  Now, I've said before, I know where bin Laden is. You know, he may or may not be in one of these caves or holes in the ground, but I know he's not too far away from Tora Bora, so that's where we're focusing our efforts.\n\nAnd let me tell you, I'm very confident in our military's ability to track him down and get him.  And when we do, as we said, we want him dead or alive. If he's alive, we'll put him on trial for his crimes, and if he's dead, well, that's fine too.\n\nAnd as for the war on terrorism, we must not be distracted by a single individual, no matter how evil.  We have a duty, a duty to the American people, to root out this scourge, to root out the terrorist network that opposes freedom, that opposes democracy, and that seeks to do us harm.  And that's exactly what we're doing.\n\nWe're doing it in Afghanistan, we're doing it in the Philippines, we're doing it in the globe, as we work to destroy al-Qaida's ability to plan and execute attacks on our freedom.  And I'm confident, Bob, that we will prevail in this effort.  We will prevail, and we will bring the perpetrators of these heinous crimes to justice."

We believe that Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime have engaged in numerous atrocities, egregious human rights abuses, and war crimes throughout their rule. As we've seen in various reports, they've utilized chemical and biological agents against their own citizens, not to mention their neighbors. Their record on the matter is unmistakable.\n\nWe've documented cases of massacres, ethnic cleansing, and forced labor camps, just to mention a few of these examples, and they must be held accountable for these atrocious actions. This does not justify the use of terror and violence against our troops or against the Iraqi people, but it does underscore the necessity of upholding a new standard of justice and civilization in Iraq.\n\nRegarding your second question, let me be clear: we will defend our troops with the tools necessary to protect them, and we will do this in accordance with international humanitarian law. It's our commitment to not use those types of weapons first, but if we were to face an attack of such a capability, from chemical, biological, or maybe even nuclear, we'll reserve the right to defend ourselves, make no mistake about it.\n\nNow, let me emphasize that we prefer a resolution through peaceful means, and we think the Iraqi people deserve a hopeful, a future, free from the repressive grip of the Saddam Hussein regime. The proper preservation of human rights and a guarantee of peace in the region must prevail."

I want to assure the American people that our embassy and our folks in the region are monitoring the situation closely.\n\nAs you're aware, there have been reports about a possible cease-fire agreement between Hamas and other Palestinian factions. While I'm not sure about the details of the agreement, my administration is hoping that if in fact it's true, it would bring a much-needed calm to the region.\n\nOur diplomatic team has been working tirelessly with our European allies, with the Quartet on the Middle East, and with key Middle Eastern leaders to find a peaceful resolution to this conflict.  This would be a big step forward because it would demonstrate that Palestinian factions are willing to seek a peaceful path.\n\nIf a cease-fire holds - we stress \"if\" - I believe it would create the moment for a meaningful discussion about the underlying issues, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and a way to advance the Roadmap to Peace - which by the way, the Roadmap is a key part of the international community's commitment to supporting a two-state solution.\n\nBut I also want to make it clear that any pause in violence does not - I repeat, does not - condone or legitimize the Palestinians' use of terrorism against Israel. I want to assure the people of Israel that America stands firmly behind you, in your right to self-defense, and we expect the Israeli government to take all necessary measures to protect Israeli citizens.\n\nIt's more than just a standoff between two nations. It's about two conflicting visions of the future of the Holy Land. One vision is a Palestinian state that can live in peace and couple with a Jewish state of Israel. That's what we're striving for."

While they were unable to pinpoint the exact trajectory earlier, we now believe the long-range missile was headed towards Guam.\n\nRegarding your second question, I'd like to assure the American people and the world that our national ballistic missile system remains operational and effective. While we did not have to engage this particular missile, our system, including the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System and the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system, are designed to protect our allies and our homeland from such threats.\n\nOur system's performance in intercepting and destroying enemy missiles has been impressive, with numerous successful tests and deployments. While no MISSILE defense technology is 100% effective, I have faith in the tireless work of our defense officials, scientists and engineers who continue to improve our defenses, strengthen our deterrent, and keep the American people safe.\n\n(pausing, looking out the room)\n\nMake no mistake, my fellow Americans, our resolve remains firm: we continue to stand strong against threats from rogue nations like North Korea.

However, I acknowledge the current administration's difficulty in containing the country's nuclear ambitions.\n\nBut let me tell you, the policy differences between my administration and the current administration on North Korea \u2013 while I understand it may not seem so at the moment \u2013 are vastly different. My administration took a strict approach with regards to preconditions of direct talks. We required a verifiable, irreversible dismantlement of nuclear, biological, and chemical programs before we ever even sat down to talk.\n\nOn the other hand, it appears this administration has employed a more soft approach, hoping that diplomacy could persuade North Korea to give up these infernal arsenals. And, in retrospect, the results display no signs of success.\n\nAs for the redline, well - while I agree, as I have in the past \u2013 military actions are always on the table, but it is first and foremost to prevent any aggressive North Korean military actions against our allies in South Korea. Any failure to uphold the safety of its allies is a redline.\n\nFurthermore, preventing North Korea from selling these nuclear products to Iran or any other nefarious actors that might employ these programs again is also dangerous and represents a line that should not be complied with. We will always maintain a posture allowing us the ability to defend our ally and deter any nuclear proliferation."

Any legislation that attempts to limit my authority as Commander in Chief would be Merely political posturing. \n\nAs for my commitment to vetoing any troop-withdrawal deadline, that's still my position. We cannot set artificial timetables for withdrawal when the situation on the ground is as fluid as it is in Iraq. We must ensure that our troops have the stability and security they need to complete their mission, and any artificial deadline would only serve to undermine that effort.\n\nWe're making progress in Iraq, but we're not there yet. Our military leaders and the Iraqi government are making strides, and I'm not about to jeopardize that progress with hasty or ill-conceived legislation. My duty as Commander in Chief is to protect our troops and our national interests, and I will continue to do just that."

We had a very productive meeting prior to this press conference, discussing the important issues facing the continent of Africa.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to assure the people of Africa and the international community that the United States is committed to bilateral and multilateral efforts to address the challenges we've been discussing.  The crisis in Darfur, the conflict in Somali, and the recent tribal clashes in Kenya are clear examples of the complex challenges that affect the security, stability, and prosperity of the people of Africa.\n\nOver the next 12 months, the United States will continue to lead efforts to increase humanitarian assistance to the regions affected by these conflicts. We will work closely with our partners in the international community, including the African Union, to support African-led peacekeeping missions and provide training and resources to help African nations build their capacity to maintain stability and security.\n\nAdditionally, we will continue to engage with Sudanese leaders to ensure their commitment to stabilizing Darfur and working towards a peaceful resolution of the Darfur conflict. America will support efforts to bring peace and stability to Sudan and advocates for the rights of displaced people in these regions.\n\nIn Somalia, we will work to support the Transitional Federal Government, which we recognize as the legitimate government of Somalia, to defeat al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations, and to bring stability to that country.

It was a handshake of friendship maybe, a moment of relations there but not directly requesting her input now.\n\nTo answer your question, we're aware that there's a discussion taking place in Baghdad. As you know, our mission in Iraq is to ensure the people of Iraq can govern themselves and have stability so the nation can be a strong partner in the region. The negotiations on the Status of Forces Agreement are routine, it's a topic that needs to be discussed. Any decision made will be made in the best interest of both the United States, our troops, and the Iraqi people.

We're committed to a long-term partnership with Pakistan. As I mentioned during my visit to Pakistan last year, our relationship is based on a mutual interest in stability and security in South Asia.\n\nSecondly, I'd like to stress that our relationship with India is complex, and we have a wide range of interests that we pursue here in the region. At the same time, we have a deep commitment to help Pakistan modernize its military and economy, to make it a compelling partner in regional security and stability.\n\nIn that regard, our defense assistance to Pakistan has already reached almost $1.2 billion in the fiscal year 2003, and we'll continue to focus on providing advanced military technology, to enhance Pakistan's ability to counter terrorism and its northern neighbor. Our non-military aid to Pakistan is also substantial, at over $120 million for fiscal year 2003, to help Pakistan develop its infrastructure, including its energy, education, and health sectors.\n\nNow, we're not going to restrict it, in the military assistance we're giving to Pakistan, which is against one specific neighbor but help in progress of activities, vary towards peacekeeping in Afghanistan and they are going to be affecting to a security, especially sub regional origins against that proliferation, out of safety of some neighboring states."

Their support has been invaluable, and we're grateful for their efforts in the region. \n\nHowever, I must express some concern about Turkey's stance on Iraq. The lack of full cooperation from Turkey, particularly in regard to the northern front, can indeed complicate our military operations and make our mission more difficult.\n\nAs to the potential consequences, let me be clear: our responsibility is to ensure that we complete our mission in Iraq. The safety and security of our troops are my top priority. But as we move forward, we will continue to expect our allies, including Turkey, to fully support us in this effort.\n\nRegarding Turkey's bid for EU membership, I would like to clarify that the United States is not directly involved in that process. The decision on Turkey's membership in the European Union is ultimately up to the EU member countries. However, we do share a close relationship with Turkey, and we have urged continued reform efforts in Turkey, particularly in regards to human rights and democratic development. But this is a matter for the EU to decide.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Turkey is a crucial regional player, and we will continue to nurture and develop our partnership with them. But let me be crystal clear: the United States will not shy away from challenging our allies when we have concerns, and we expect them to meet certain standards of behavior."

We expect significant contributions from countries like the United Kingdom, Poland, and other key coalition partners. These nations, along with others, understand the global threat that Saddam Hussein posed, and they're willing to work side-by-side with us to ensure that he no longer poses a threat to the free world.\n\nNow, it's also worth noting that the United Nations Security Council's resolution provides a mandate for us to take the necessary actions to deal with the aftermath of Saddam's government. So we're seeing momentum build around the world, and we're very encouraged by that.\n\nRegarding the turnover and the potential for violence, I think it's natural that there will be challenges in the period ahead. The Iraqi people are free at last, and they're beginning to take steps towards self-governance. We'll be working closely with the coalition to provide security and stability to the region.\n\nWe've got a comprehensive plan in place, and I'm confident that we'll be able to minimize the risk of violence.

As I stated yesterday, and it's been made clear, Hizballah uses terrorism and violence as a means of achieving its objectives. We believe that achieving peace and stability in the region, in the Middle East, means working with groups that are committed to peace and non-violence.\n\nNow, I understand that there are a lot of different views on Hizbillah in the region. As a matter of fact, our position has been clear: Hizballah is a terrorist organization, considered as such by the state department. We have identified it as such. But, our door is open to anyone who wants to use peaceful and democratic means to achieve their objectives. Anyone can make the choice to lay down their arms, commit to peace, and become a force for moderation in the region.\n\nRegarding flexibility, I have to say that flexibility and patience have been big themes of my policies in the Middle East. From our efforts in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to our commitment to peace in Northern Ireland, we have been willing to make concessions and changes when circumstances warrant. However, I must clarify that we cannot reward those who use terrorism and violence. And we cannot abandon our core principles on dictating a different view we use towards Hizballah.\n\nThat being said, in order for us to work with Hizballah, there's got to be a change in its behavior. Our position would be that Hizballah must be willing to go back to the Geneva Conventions, that international agreements for the treatment of states and insurgents that agree to principles, and the concepts, not subject as a bi-lateral relations agenda items.\n\nNow I would like to emphasize, that I've always made it clear, if they look for peace, work through peaceful means and stop state-sponsored terrorism, Engage in dialogue with Lebanon government. That does not mean we're willing to talk to them, or even meet with them until these things we stated. That's a big distinction not everyone pays attention too."

(pauses for a moment) Well, I understand that the American people are skeptical about reforming Social Security, and it's a big challenge for us in Washington. Now, I've often said I'm committed to making sure that Social Security is solvent for generations to come. The people who work hard their whole lives and contribute to social security in order to live their golden years, need to know their government will be there to support them.\n\nThe fact is, we don't have a lot of time to waste when it comes to reforming Social Security. I believe our trust fund will be broke by 2042, if we just keep doing what we're doing now. And I think we need to tackle this issue in a bipartisan way with Members of both parties. We had a good discussion on this in Congress, but we simply were not able to build consensus. Disagreements do not make for progress sometimes.\n\nTo answer your question directly, I believe we had the momentum, we had the opportunity to seize this moment, but, most significantly, the lack of movement on the elimination or reduction of Social Security benefits due to the decreases in Social Security as an option led the Democratic Party to not wish to push boldly to fix the social security gap through moving alternative options to removing the rising payment to recipients which though are stated are set aside provided senior Americans the definitive reassurance that they cannot live out their golden years rest assured.\n\nSo, we've got to keep pushing forward on this issue, and we're willing to continue to work with Members of Congress to find a solution.

You know, I'm a strong believer in the power of American leadership, and I've made some tough decisions over the last years, decisions that have put our Nation through a period of testing and challenge.\n\nNow, I'm not naive \u2013 I know we can struggle with different opinions, and I respect the right of the American people to hold differing views. But I still believe that our Nation must stay committed to our core values, to our interests, and to our unwavering commitment to the safety and security of the American people.\n\nAnd as I said, I think we've made real progress across the board. But I understand that the source of strength in America is not just the office of the President, it's the American people who are the stewards of freedom, personally, who are the ceaseless advocates for human dignity and who continue to stand by the principles of the United States as a force for good in the world.\n\nIn answer to the second part of your question, we have to be honest with the American people, we have opposition. I know there are some in the Congress and around the country who are naturally weighing in on their views of the situation in Iraq.\n\n(Looks around the room)\n\nYou know, it's understandable that there would be dissent. The issue of Iraq, of whether we stay in the fight and of whether we stay true to our commitment to stability is a very weighty one.

I understand your concerns about the situation in Iraq, and I share them, but I think it's a bit too simplistic to say that the situation in Iraq has emboldened authoritarian regimes in the Middle East.\n\nMake no mistake, the vision that we had when we invaded in 2003 was to use the removing of Saddam Hussein as an opportunity to democratize the region. And I truly believe that we're making progress. Elections have been held, a new government has been formed, and the Iraqi people are taking control of their own destiny.\n\nOf course, there are setbacks, and we've faced challenges, but I believe that the commitment to freedom and democracy is alive and well in Iraq. And as you know, I've made it clear that we'll continue to support the Iraqi people in their efforts to build a stable, peaceful, and democratic nation.\n\nAs for Syria and Iran, I agree that those regimes have taken actions that are of concern to the United States. But I don't believe that the situation in Iraq has directly emboldened them. The underlying forces at work here are ancient and complex, dating back centuries, between Sunni and Shia, and between Arabs and Persians.\n\nWe, the United States, are part of a broader effort to confront terrorism, and our Middle East policy is guided by a core principle: that the spread of freedom, democracy, and human rights will provide the best hope of protecting American interests and preventing the spread of terrorism.\n\nAnd let me tell you, we will continue to stand by freedom-loving peoples across the region, especially in Iraq, and support them as they build their democracy, even in the face of these challenges.\n\nWe can't give up on the promise of freedom and liberty. We cannot surrender to the forces of terror and violence.

We believe that a transition to democracy would be a positive development for the Cuban people and would open up new opportunities for freedom, prosperity, and economic growth.\n\nRegarding Cuba's future, our administration supports the policy of promoting democracy, human rights, and a free market economy in Cuba. We believe that a free and democratic Cuba would be a major step forward for that country and would benefit the Cuban people.\n\nRegarding the concerns of Cuban exiles living in the United States, we understand their desire to reclaim their property and one day return to their homeland. We will work with Congress to promote initiatives that would facilitate the return of Cuban nationals who've fled the island. But let me be clear, our priority is the advancement of democracy, human rights, and a free and open society in Cuba.\n\nThe Helms-Burton Act is a bipartisan law passed in 1996 to offer an opportunity for the Cuban people to return to their homes and businesses. This act restricts travel and investment in Cuba, and we believe it's an important measure to maintain pressure on the Cuban regime.  While the expropriation of property from Cuban nationals without compensation when Fidel's government took over under the so-called annexation occurred on July 31 1959 is indeed an enormous wrong to bear, Bush administration proposed trade and property claim resolution measures to allow US property in Cuba to be partially paid, however without agreeing on a continuation of the embargo."

We're concerned about the violence and the allegations of election irregularities that have taken place there. We want to see a peaceful resolution to this situation.\n\nNow, I'm not one to set expectations too high. But I do think that this visit can be an important step forward. Secretary Rice will be talking to President Kibaki and other leaders about the need for them to take steps to address these allegations, to work together to find a resolution to this crisis, and to prevent further violence in the country.\n\nAs for how much can get done on Monday, it's hard to say. We're realistic about the challenges that lie ahead.

We're analyzing the situation on the ground right now. We are committed to supporting the people of Kenya, just like we are committed to supporting other democratic movements around the world.

This posed a direct threat to the United States, to our allies, and to the stability of the region.\n\nWe also considered Saddam's history of aggression, his invasion of Kuwait in 1990, and his continued development of a military program that included long-range missiles and other capabilities that threatened his neighbors.\n\nAdditionally, we took into account the efforts of the United Nations to disarm Iraq through multiple inspections and disarmament agreements, which were followed by Saddam's aggression towards the inspectors and his willingness to continue his pursuit of WMD capabilities in secret.\n\nBased on this information, we made a decision to act, and we did so with a clear and compelling reason: to protect the American people, to disarm Saddam Hussein, and to bring peace and stability to the region."

In the face of danger, we must not be ambiguous. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the state sponsors of terrorism, pose a clear and present threat to the security of the United States and the world.\n\nWe will work with our allies to share the burden and the responsibility of combatting these threats, but we cannot and will not wait for international consensus on every last detail before we act to protect ourselves and our citizens. The world is a complex and often unforgiving place, and we must be prepared to take calculated risks to ensure our safety and security.\n\nI would say to those who believe we can only be effective with the approval of others, 'We will do what we must do to protect the American people, regardless of what our critics may say.' We'll engage in diplomacy, we'll work with our friends and allies, and we'll seek a broad coalition of support, but we cannot allow moral or diplomatic posturing to paralyze us into inaction."

Now, regarding the situation on the ground, I've been working closely with Prime Minister Sharon, and I've had numerous conversations with him. I think it's unfair to characterize my efforts with the Prime Minister as a failure, because the truth is, this is a complex and difficult situation.\n\nRegarding the current military actions, I've spoken to Prime Minister Sharon and reminded him that Israel has the right to defend herself, and any action she takes should be done with a clear understanding that we're committed to a comprehensive peace agreement. My statement earlier today reflected my continued support for Prime Minister Sharon, while also emphasizing the importance of implementing the Roadmap for Peace and working towards a long-term solution.\n\nI wouldn't consider my words, 'without delay,' as new or more critical than previous demands. I've consistently urged Prime Minister Sharon to find a way forward that would promote peace and stability in the region. I've emphasized that while we understand the need for Israel to take actions to protect her security, we also believe that such actions should be limited to what is necessary, and that a clear commitment to withdraw from Palestinian territories is essential.\n\nYou see, I believe in the policy I put in place \u2013 staying the course, taking a comprehensive approach to this fundamental issue. Now, the language in my most recent statement, as I said, was about referring to the PM that these past efforts of withdrawal need to be implemented all at once."

    "gen_response": "(clears throat) Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I appreciate each of you being here today. Regarding the issue of intelligence lapses before September 11th, I do believe that we had intelligence failures. The September 11th attacks were a wake-up call, and it's clear that we didn't have the depth and breadth of intelligence that we needed to prevent this attack.\n\nNow, with regard to your question about an independent commission, I understand why people might think that's a good idea. I've set up a number of investigations into the matter, including the 9/11 Commission, which I believe is doing outstanding work. Congress, the Intelligence Committees, all those entities are doing their job, and I believe it's a bipartisan effort.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, we don't need another layer of bureaucracy, with another investigation that's going to duplicate what's already being done. I've got faith in the dedicated people at the 9/11 Commission, and I've asked them to move as quickly and thoroughly as possible. We've already got the FBI, the CIA, they're doing their job.\n\nAs for the August 6th memo, I can tell you it's part of the investigation into the September 11th attacks, and we'll do our best to ensure that the work done on that will help to clarify the circumstances that led to our nation's response to the attacks.\n\nNow, with regard to Iraq. The threat from Saddam Hussein is real, and I don't take his expressed intent lightly. Iraq has the means and resources to develop biological and chemical weapons, which is wrong.\n\nWe await the report from the United Nations Inspectors as to their findings. The right thing to do for stability in the region, the right thing to do to protect the people of the United States and our allies abroad is to get rid of this guy and bring those inspectors in. And then, of course, we'll re-evaluate or determine the next step. But I'm committed to what we can do, and we're working with our allies and Russia, even China.\n\n(x-large break)\n\nDon't break out with chatter no more. I appreciate it."

If I'm not mistaken, actually it's 2 years - from his involvement with the/kAthenton & Co banking investment group.

The security of the United States, that of our allies such as South Korea and Japan, and the stability of the region are all at risk if North Korea were to succeed in developing a nuclear arsenal. We cannot afford to have rogue states possessing the ultimate capability of mass destruction.\n\nNow, regarding the pace of diplomacy, I am concerned that the international community's efforts have not had the necessary impact yet. The six-party talks, as you know, involve the two Koreas, the United States, China, Russia, and Japan. I've asked our Secretary of State, Colin Powell, to lead our efforts. The goal of these multilateral talks is to put together a comprehensive program for denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nMake no mistake, we are committed to a diplomatic solution, but we must remain vigilant and firm in our resolve. The stakes are high, and the North Koreans have shown us they are willing to cheat and deceive in order to achieve their objectives. Therefore, we will work closely with our allies and other partners to persuade North Korea to choose a different path, a path of development and peace, rather than nuclear weaponry.\n\nI want to assure the American people and the international community that we will not overlook the threat that North Korea poses. We will use all necessary measures to protect our security and the security of our friends. I've made it clear that all options are available to the United States."

Rice has not replaced the process, but rather joined it. Her expertise and insight have been invaluable to our Iraq policy discussions, but also the decision-making process remains with the President. In reality, the transition which occured back in 2003, was simply Condoleezza Rice taking on more responsibilities in terms of coordinating global efforts in the region.\n\nAs to your second question, we will continue to seek a way forward in Iraq that allows for greater stability and reconciliation. Regarding troop levels, while I know that everyone's focus is on seeing a reduced footprint in Iraq, I'd like to remind the American people the job we're doing there is a tough one - and alas, goals regarding troop levels are indefinite."

I can tell you that no matter what the polls say or what the election results are in this country, the decision to liberate Iraq will have been worth it.\n\nFor the first time in our nation's history, we've been attacked on our own soil by people who were harbored in a country harbored by Saddam Hussein. I had an obligation to the American people to make sure that we went after the people who committed that heinous act and to take out Saddam Hussein's regime.\n\nAnd let me tell you, it's a tough decision, but it was the right decision. We're finding out, as we speak, that Saddam did have weapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological nature. And it's clear that if we would have left Saddam in power, he would have continued to pose a threat not just to Iraq and the region but to America.\n\nI don't intend to take advice from history based on the suffix of an election, to my fellow citizen. If we pull out of Iraq at this juncture and we don't give Iraqis the opportunity to build a democratic society like ours and have a chance of a characteristic prosperity, it would be tantamount to an abdication of our responsibility. We've seen the human suffering, we've seen the moving emotions, and we can't abandon them now. Iraq is a work in progress, and we'll see an improvement, but this nation is better off when we get our goals in check.\n\nAnd that's the bottom line - we will keep working on our goals in Iraq, and we will help them to achieve democracy in their country."

Let me tell you, the Prime Minister of Iraq has the responsibility to ensure the security and stability of the Iraqi people, and I respect his decisions. However, I think the imposition of martial law is a step that should be taken with great caution and with careful consideration.\n\nWe've made significant progress in Iraq, and we want to continue to support the new government in their efforts to establish a stable and secure democracy. We've come too far, and made too many sacrifices, to let the Iraqi military become repressive or authoritarian.\n\nMartial law should be a last resort, and the Iraqi government should exhaust all other options before taking such a step. In terms of U.S. forces, our commitment is to support the Iraqi government and people in their fight against terrorism and to help build a stable democracy.\n\nHowever, any action that involves the use of U.S. forces would have to be consistent with our national interests and our values. We won't send troops to prop up a repressive regime. Our goal is to help the Iraqis build a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I think the Prime Minister and the Iraqi government should be careful about imposing martial law, and we'll work closely with them to ensure that any action they take is consistent with the aspirations of the Iraqi people for freedom and democracy.

We want to make sure that the Iraqi people are able to come together, to participate in a free and fair election, and to choose their new leaders. \n\nThis operation is not just about Fallujah; it's about the future of Iraq.

The enemies of freedom are emboldened, and they're dug in. But we'll be working with the Iraqi security forces, and we'll be using all the military might at our disposal to achieve our objectives.\n\nThe stakes are high, but I'm confident that we will succeed.

As I've said before, I understand the extreme importance of expressing our condolences and gratitude to the families of our fallen heroes. I personally sign a great many letters, and I make sure to review and personalize those letters whenever possible.\n\nIn some cases, unfortunately, I have had to rely on my staff to complete this task in a timely manner. I want to assure you that I take this matter very seriously and we are taking steps to ensure that those families who have sacrificed so much for our country receive the respect and gratitude they truly deserve.\n\nWhile I understand the concerns about Secretary Rumsfeld's actions, I want to emphasis that he has served this nation with great honor and distinction, and I do not view this as a reflection on his character. The Secretary has my full confidence and appreciation for his dedication to our nation's security and defense.\n\nStill, I want to assure the American people that I take the gravitas of this issue seriously, and we will do everything in our power to ensure that the letters of condolence are handled with the dignity and respect they deserve.\n\nNow, I know that some may feel that I should have taken a stronger stance on this issue, and perhaps I should have taken a more direct approach. But let me tell you, being President is a tough job, and sometimes you have to make decisions based on a variety of factors, including the advice of your team and the circumstances at hand.\n\nEven still, I take full responsibility, and we will do everything we can to prevent such a situation from arising in the future."

On Social Security, I've made clear that I believe we must act this year to preserve this vital program for future generations. I've proposed a comprehensive Social Security reform plan that includes personal accounts, which I believe will provide a safer and more secure retirement for Americans.\n\nAs for the timeline, I've called on Congress to act this year. I've spoken with my fellow leaders in Congress, and I'm optimistic that we can make progress on this issue. However, I also believe that we must be realistic about the time it takes for Congress to work its will.\n\nIf we don't see substantial progress by the end of the summer, I'll start to get concerned. I'd like to see a bill by the end of the year, but I'll give Congress the time they need to do their job. I'm not going to put a specific date on it, but I believe we can work together to get something done.\n\nNow, regarding your question about dropping personal accounts: I hear what you're saying. I believe those accounts are a vital part of the comprehensive reform package I've proposed. They'll help give Americans a stake in their retirement, allow them to invest in the stock market, and provide a more secure future. However, I'm a willing partner for anything that will get the job done.

Now, we want to see more. We want to see the complete disbandment of militias, any armed groups, all the way down. We want to see an authority that is in control of the Palestinian people, an authority that is committed to disarmament, and an authority that is working to recognize Israel's right to exist.\n\nNow, Hamas is a terrorist organization. I've said it, and I'll keep saying it, that Hamas is a terrorist organization, and their actions have been contrary to peace. The idea that they would be part of the Palestinian Authority's government, in my view, is a recipe for further violence. And I would - (pauses) I would not abandon the Palestinian people because of the presence of Hamas, but I would like to see Hamas out of the government.\n\nNow, as to associates of Yasser Arafat, I indeed agree that there are individuals that are still harboring extremism and anti-Israel views.

Individuals serving presidents are going to be criticized, and no one knows that more than my predecessor, the President Clinton, from whom I inherited no residualism and needing a big defense budget surplus -or my predecessor, Bill Clinton.\n\nIn fact, after deliberating for months, we managed to put through some meaningful reforms that needed change.

The development and testing of such technology poses a direct threat to our allies in the region, particularly Japan and South Korea, and could potentially jeopardize global stability.\n\nIf Pyongyang proceeds with a long-range missile test, we will do everything in our power to defend our nation and our allies. We will work closely with the United Nations Security Council to seek severe economic sanctions and other measures to isolate North Korea and pressure its leadership to change their behavior.\n\nAs for penalties, I believe that North Korea should face significant consequences for its actions. We're considering a range of options, including embargoes on oil and other vital goods, restrictions on financial transactions, and travel restrictions for key officials. We'll also be working with our international partners to strengthen our collective defense capabilities in the region and ensure that we have the necessary military capabilities to respond if necessary.\n\nRegarding your question to the EU, I'd like to invite our Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador John Bolton, to address this question.

It's a tough issue, yes, it is. But we've made significant progress on that front as well. I believe it's in the best interest of our country to address this issue with compassion and pragmaticity. We need a comprehensive approach that offers legal status for those who work hard and play by the rules. And I'm determined that we will act on this legislation.\n\nYou're right to say that as we head into the home stretch, electoral politics will play a role, I wish that wasn't the case, but I'm committed to finding common ground. I've always said to the American people that governing means getting things done.\n\nWe will do everything in our power to put politics aside, and that we will work with both parties to reach a fair and just solution to this question. We have the power to act, and I'm urging those on Capitol Hill to work with us to find that middle ground, that compromise that America needs."

    "gen_response": "(pausing for a moment, looking directly at the reporter)\n\nI understand that this is a difficult conflict, and as President, the burden of making tough decisions falls on me. The decision to go to war in Iraq was one I made with careful consideration, with the support of the international community and with the goal of making the world a safer place. \n\n(voice firm but solemn)\n\nNow, I agree that the consequences of war are tragic, and they're real. There's no doubt about it, the loss of life, both civilian and military, is something that weighs heavily on me every day. However, I want to correct a misapprehension - this was not a war of my choosing, but a response to the threat presented by Saddam Hussein's regime. Pursuant to United Nations Resolution 1441, Saddam failed to comply with the disarmament of his nuclear, chemical, and biological programs. Saddam had himself to thank for this war. The international community gave him chance after chance to comply and he ignored those chances.\n\nI appreciate your emphasis on the humanitarian aspect of this conflict, but let us not forget, in all these terrible metrics you mentioned; the core issue remains the dedisregard for human rights, the governmental tyranny of the Saddam regime that cost amongst many millions."

    "gen_response": "My position remains clear. Secretary Ridge and I, we've been saying for weeks now, the threat from terrorism remains real and the possibility of an attack from the enemy is a possibility. As for what I've been told, I've been briefed numerous times on the intel that the U.S. is working with. We have confident sources that say we could see potential signs of a threat over the summer months but as with all intel, nothing's certain until the information becomes concrete.\n\nI think it's accurate for the Secretary to discuss the possible feeling that there may be an imminent threat. We've always conveyed to the American people the clear warning and constantly assess the signs."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you.  I know that families are hurting right now, and we're working hard to address the issue of high energy prices.  Now, I'm not gonna stand up here and pretend that I can solve this problem overnight.  But I can tell you that my administration is taking steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and to increase our domestic energy production.\n\nThe energy report that's being released today highlights the need for a comprehensive energy policy that tackles this issue from multiple angles.  We've got a four-part plan: increasing domestic production, increasing energy efficiency, promoting alternative fuels, and making sure that we take care of our nuclear and coal program so we can have reliable, clean and affordable energy.\n\nNow, I agree with Secretary Abraham that OPEC has some responsibility in getting these prices under control.  Their organization's actions, or lack thereof, have led to these high prices.  But let me tell you, we can't just rely on OPEC to solve this problem.  We need a comprehensive approach to address the root causes of these high prices, and that's what this energy report does.\n\nThe report also calls for conservation efforts, and I encourage Americans to do their part by adjusting their driving habits, by increasing the fuel efficiency of our cars, and by being mindful of how we use energy in our homes and our businesses.\n\nAnd let me remind you, we've taken steps already to help low-income families who are getting hurt by these high gas prices.  We've increased funding for programs that help low-income families pay their utility bills, and we've provided incentives for communities to invest in transportation alternatives like buses and light rails.\n\nSo, I think this report is a tough, comprehensive response to a tough problem, and I'm confident that with our strategy, we can make a difference for American families who are hurting right now."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you, thank you for that question.  I appreciate it.\n\nWell, first of all, I think a stronger and more united Europe is a positive development. It's a successful story. The Europeans have worked hard to build a more cohesive and integrated Europe, and we respect that. We respect their efforts.\n\nHowever, the issue of their ambition to be the number one economy in the world is different. We believe that our economy is strong and will remain strong. We're the world's largest economy, and we've got a free-market system that's the envy of the world. We've got innovative companies, we've got entrepreneurs, we've got people who are hardworking and educated. We believe that our economic strength is based on our values, our institutions, and our people.\n\nNow, as for the question of whether this presents a challenge to the United States, I would say that it does present some challenges. But I don't think it presents a threat to us. I think it's more of an opportunity for us to work together. The United States and the European Union have a relationship built on mutual interests, democracy, and shared values. We have a strong partnership that serves both our nations well.\n\nAnd as for your question about decreasing our engagement in Europe, no, I don't see that happening. We're committed to our relationships with our NATO allies, we're committed to the transatlantic partnership, and we're committed to working together on the big issues of the day \u2013 counterterrorism, nonproliferation, trade, and economic development.\n\nIn fact, we're working together with the Europeans on a number of fronts, from our efforts to rebuild Iraq to our work together on Afghanistan. We're also working together on climate change, and we're working together on economic issues. So, I don't see a decrease in our engagement with Europe at all.\n\nAnd I'll tell you why. It's because, at the end of the day, our interests are shared. We want to see these countries be stable, prosperous, and free, because that benefits us directly, and it benefits the world.\n\nThank you for that question."

I've read it, and I think it's a good-faith effort to understand the complexities of the decision-making process.  We've addressed the specific question about when the invasion plans for Iraq were initiated.\n\nNow, let me tell you what's important.  The 9/11 attacks changed the world landscape in a profound way.  We were dealing with a different threat, a different kind of enemy - one that's malicious and unpredictable.  In the aftermath of those attacks, we started examining our security posture and how we dealt with existential threats to our nation.\n\nIn terms of Iraq, I can tell you that the intelligence pointed out that Saddam Hussein had connections to terrorism, that he was pursuing WMDs, and that his regime was a dire threat to regional stability.  We started exploring our options, which included diplomacy and the possibility of going to the U.N. for inspections, but also prepared for different contingencies, as any responsible commander-in-chief would.\n\nSo, you know, I think the term 'charade' is a misleading description of our efforts.  I think it's inaccurate, and I think it's just that, a term. What I did was honest to the public, was relied on the advice of national security professionals, and was determined to do what's necessary to protect this great nation."

    "gen_response": "My fellow American, I appreciate the question. Let me tell you, I've given a lot of thought to this, and I've spoken with our military leaders, and our Secretary of State, and our National Security Council.\n\nOur position on this is clear: it's up to the Iraqi regime to allow these inspectors to do their job. We believe that Saddam Hussein has intelligence on where they're going, and he's been falsifying information, and he's been doing his best to hinder these inspections. And we've given them ample time, an extension to try and complete their work.\n\nAs for civilians, we're doing our best to provide shelter and security for humanitarian workers and journalists. In fact, we're reaching out to these groups, urging them to do their best to withdraw from the combat zone. But I cannot predict the actions of Saddam's forces, or the level of violence they might unleash on innocent civilians.\n\nAs for giving Iraq a chance to get out of the way, our military will do everything it can to avoid the civilian population, as is our custom in all military operations. That being said, our forces will be moving into populated areas where we have reason to believe that Saddam's regime is hiding its missiles, its chemical agents, or its nuclear scientists.\n\nAmerica will give adequate time for humanitarian corridors to be established, for people to leave, and for our forces to safely and effectively carry out their mission. We're working closely with our allies to ensure that we're providing the maximum amount of warning, and doing everything we can to minimize the risk to civilians.\n\nLet me be clear: our objective is not to harm innocent Iraqis. Our objective is to disarm Saddam Hussein, to protect the Iraqi people from a ruler who has brought nothing but suffering and despair to his own people, and to make America and the world a safer place."

    "gen_response": "(in a thick Texas drawl) Ah, thank you, welcome \u2013 welcome to the press conference. I'm glad to be here to address your questions. Now, let me speak to the first part of that question. While I think it's fair to say that the current situation between Russia and the United States has put a strain on our relationship, I would not describe it as a complete breakdown in cooperation. Despite our differences, we will continue to engage with the Russians on those areas where our interests align.\n\nNow, let me speak directly to your second question. I want to make one thing clear: we made the decision to liberate Iraq in coalition with our allies, based on the threat that Saddam Hussein posed to his own people, the region, and the world. We consulted extensively with our allies and the international community, but in the end, it was a decision made in accordance with the principles of self-defense and the desire to bring freedom to the Iraqi people.\n\nIn so far as by-passing the United Nations, I think that's a mischaracterization of the facts. We did go to the United Nations and obtained a resolution authorizing the use of force if Iraq failed to comply. When the UN didn't enforce the resolutions it had made, especially the requirement that Saddam disarm, we decided to take action on our own.\n\nNow, I'm confident that our actions in Iraq have brought about a crucial battle for the spread of freedom and democracy, and we must continue to work with others to build a stable and prosperous Iraq. And to those critics at home and abroad, I would say that it's not always easy to look back and second guess the tough decisions we face as a nation. We did what we thought was necessary to protect our nation's interests, our values, and our security."

    "gen_response": "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your question. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify the chronology and rationale behind my administration's decisions regarding the 9/11 and Iraq threats.\n\nFirst, in regards to the 9/11 attacks, we've been criticized for not taking action sooner to prevent or preempt these terrorist attacks. I want to assure the American people that we had no credible information of an imminent attack, no specific intelligence to confirm a hijacking or terrorist attack of such catastrophic proportions. The 9/11 attacks were a shock to our nation, and the United States had no capabilities or authority to pre-empt such a threat without clear evidence.\n\nThe Director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, as well as the 9/11 Commission Report, have made it clear that there were no known plots involving airplanes, hijackings, or explosives. Despite this, we were on high alert due to an existing state of heightened awareness from past terrorist threats in the region.\n\nAs for the Iraq threat, some have criticized my decision to take action in 2003, given the lack of clear evidence of weapons of mass destruction. I made a decision based on available intelligence at the time, supported by Secretary Rumsfeld, Secretary Powell, and the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE). Intelligence revealed there was a substantial capability for WMDs. It was estimated that Iraq could launch an attack with Weapons of Mass Destruction within 45 minutes, approximately.\n\nTo answer your second question regarding threat levels for action, the determination to take action must be guided by clear evidence and a clear understanding of the risks and consequences. As Commander-in-Chief, my priority has to be the security and the safety of the American people. The United States will take proactive military action when a threat to the homeland is imminent and compelling, with a credible source that includes actionable intelligence and plausible means of attack.\n\nIn determining when and where to act, key indicators of a credible threat may include:\n\n*   Clear and explicit statements, intercepted communications, or documentation pointing to an imminent plot or attack;\n*   Credible intelligence that confirms a hierarchy of intent, resources, capabilities and capabilities, and planned timelines for completing the terrorist action;\n*

    "gen_response": "(clears throat) Well, I understand that Prime Minister al-Maliki may have... expressed some dissatisfaction with certain aspects of our post-conflict efforts in Iraq. But let me tell you, this administration went into Iraq with a clear plan to free that country from Saddam Hussein's tyranny, to help the Iraqi people build a democratic government, and to bring stability and security to the region.\n\nWe faced many challenges, challenges that were unforeseen at the time. The insurgency was a hard-fought and determined enemy, and it took time to build a sufficient Iraqi security force. But we did everything in our power to assist the Iraqis in their efforts, provided billions of dollars in aid, training and equipment, and worked closely with them to help them build a stable and effective government.\n\nWhile there may be - and have been, and will be - disagreements with the Iraqi government on various issues, I don't believe it's fair to suggest that America bears direct responsibility for all of the problems in Iraq. The Iraqis themselves have a role in shaping their own destiny, and we've given them the tools and the support they need to succeed.\n\nI would respectfully disagree with the Prime Minister's characterization of our efforts. The President and the American people, we've got skin in this game because we liberated Iraq from a brutal dictator. And we've made sacrifices, but our goal has always been to give the Iraqi people the chance to build a peaceful and prosperous future.\n\n(make a pause)\nWhat I would say to Prime Minister al-Maliki, and to the Iraqi people, is that we're committed to your success. We'll continue to do everything in our power to help you overcome the challenges you face. And I'm confident that with hard work and perseverance, Iraq will emerge as a beacon of democracy in the Middle East. Thank you."

(smiling) He's a stalwart defender of America, and I thank him for his dedication to this great country.\n\nNow, regarding your question, I think it's essential to understand the scope of our war on terror and the dangers posed by Saddam Hussein's regime. Saddam's history is marked by his support of terrorist organizations, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. While there's ongoing debate within the intelligence community about ties to Al Qaida, it is a fact that Saddam has provided safe haven to terrorists in the past and has pursued WMD capabilities that pose a threat to our very well-being.\n\nThe 9/11 Commission Report noted that Saddam Hussein's regime had 'probably' had a relationship with Al Qaida, but I must underscore that this is a matter of interpretation. As we stand here today, there's no concrete evidence to prove a direct operational link between Saddam's regime and Al Qaida. We're focused on the fact that Saddam poses a significant threat to the United States and the world due to his aggressive pursuit of WMD and his history of sponsoring terrorism.\n\nIn democracies like ours, there's always room for nuance and discussion about information. I respect differences within the intelligence community, but as Commander-in-Chief, I've made it clear that our course of action will be guided by the best interests of the United States and the protection of our people.\n\nObviously, the ultimate decision to take action in Iraq was based on a comprehensive assessment of our national security interests."

And, yes, if Iran doesn't cease these activities, it will be -- we will seek a referral of this issue to the United Nations Security Council.\n\nAs for punitive sanctions, I think it's time for the international community to express its displeasure with Iran's actions, and one option that we believe is on the table should we go to the Security Council would be economic sanctions. These would likely be aimed at imposing economic, diplomatic, and trade restrictions on Iran.\n\nNow, I want to be very clear about it, this is not just about Iran; this is about stopping a country from developing a nuclear arsenal that threatens the safety and security of the world.\n\nWe'll be working closely with other members of the EU, with the UN -- Secretary General, and our other international partners to make sure that this issue gets addressed."

We've imposed economic sanctions, and we're considering further action. But ultimately, this is a crisis that requires a diplomatic solution.\n\nMy message to the government of Sudan is this: it's time to act. The people of Darfur deserve our help, and they deserve freedom from the violence and persecution they've suffered for far too long. The United States and the international community are committed to finding a solution, but we cannot do it without the full cooperation of the government of Sudan.\n\nNow, I want to emphasize that our efforts are focused on finding a solution that involves the African Union, the United Nations, and the government of Sudan itself. We believe that a African-led solution is the best way to ensure the long-term stability and security of the region.\n\nWe're working with Secretary-General Annan, with African leaders, and with our allies to develop a comprehensive approach that includes protecting civilians, providing humanitarian aid, and promoting a just and lasting peace.

The Central Intelligence Agency, as you know, plays a vital role in keeping the American people safe from those who would seek to do harm to us. As President, I'm not at liberty to discuss the details of CIA operations. But I can tell you that my administration takes the need to protect American citizens very seriously.\n\nNow, I'm also happy to report that the United States and our European allies share a strong commitment to upholding the law and ensuring that our cooperation on counter-terrorism does not undermine our mutual values and interests. I have discussed issues of mutual concern with my European colleagues, including President Putin, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and other leaders at the recent G8 conference.\n\nNow, I want to make it clear that the United States does not condone torture, nor do we engage in activity that would be inconsistent with our laws or our values. The CIA's work includes many activities designed to gather important intelligence to help prevent terrorist attacks and to keep America safe. And as for these allegations of secret flights, I can assure you that we take these allegations very seriously. We're cooperating fully with European authorities to resolve any issues they may have raised.\n\nUnfortunately, our intelligence professionals often operate in a complex and highly classified environment, and I'm not at liberty to discuss specifics about any individual flights.

These are not fighters who are going to be swayed by ideology or most engagement, they are terrorists that have a vision of destruction and radicalization and the vision of our enemies is for an Islamic caliphate under the Taliban led leadership.\n\nWe've seen some successes, and we've seen some setbacks, but the campaign is ongoing.

The selection of U.S. attorneys should be merit-based and not influenced by partisan considerations."

As I mentioned in my most recent State of the Union address, our economy is facing serious challenges, and I believe that we can move forward on several key areas if we work together: trade, energy, education, and economic growth.\n\nIn the case of Colombia, I believe a free trade agreement with that country is essential for the people of Colombia and for our own economic interests. And I was disappointed that Congress took no action on this critical legislation, which could create jobs and job opportunities for the American people.\n\nRegarding FISA, I've made it clear that we must address the habeas corpus issues, but at the same time, we've got to ensure that we have the tools necessary to protect our citizens from the threat of terrorism that we face globally.\n\nMy view is that we've got a responsibility to the American people to work in good faith, to try to find consensus on our differences, even with the Congress. And I've always believed that the best way for us to move forward on these kinds of critical issues is to sit down with our colleagues, listen to each other's perspectives, and work out the differences.\n\nThere are members on both sides of the aisle who share our commitment to reform, to improving the economy, and to keeping our country safe. I'm committed to reach out to those individuals and to do my part in trying to find common ground.\n\nI'm not giving up, and I think there's still time for us to get something done this year."

We've had significant progress in oil production on our domestic soil, and we're committed to continuing to explore and develop our energy resources. I'm confident that America's oil and gas producers, both onshore and offshore, are accessing and extracting a substantial portion of our available resources. We'll continue to encourage and support efforts to improve domestic energy production, with an eye towards reducing our reliance on foreign oil.\n\nNow, concerning Iraq, General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker have been working closely with the Iraqi government to craft an agreement that addresses the way forward for American operations in that country. While we're open to finding mutually acceptable solutions, we must ensure that any agreement protects the security of our military personnel and advances the goals of stability and security for the Iraqi people."

I was briefed on the use of previously existing stem cell lines and we've made the decision to allow for research, but those lines were produced before the moral dilemma came up, that is, the question over when life begins.\n\nAs for the recent development regarding contamination with animal cells, my administration is looking into the matter. The fact that the research that these lines could be used for may not be effective under FDA guidelines does raise questions, and I think it's reasonable that the administration is taking a closer look at the situation.\n\nHowever, as the President, I made the decision based on the facts as they were known at the time. I believe that using these existing stem cell lines does not harm the sanctity of life and represents a way to advance the science and possibly one day find treatments for life-threatening illnesses."

I mean, the problems that affect our citizens. Now, this is a complex issue, and it's an issue that does require faith leaders - bishops, archbishops, and cardinals - to take swift, decisive action.\n\nCardinal Law, I have known him. He's a man of great faith, and I value our conversations. However, it's clear that there's a ticking clock on this issue. Pedophilia is an abomination, and it's morally reprehensible. The Catholic Church must act with the utmost haste and transparency in addressing these allegations, protecting victims, and cooperating with law enforcement to root out anyone who would misuse the trust placed in them.\n\nNow, I believe the archdiocese and the Catholic Church as a whole need to help the victims and their families heal. We have to make sure that those who committed these acts of abuse are held accountable, and I believe that the Church is moving towards that end. The Archdiocese of Boston must live up to its responsibility to address these problems, and I'm calling on them to be fully forthcoming with information, to cooperate fully with the authorities, and to answer to their flock.\n\nUltimately, it comes down to the principles of justice, fairness, and protecting the innocent. I'll be looking for concrete actions from the Archdiocese and all faith institutions to ensure that those who have been trusted with spiritual guidance are not betraying that trust. The American people expect swift and decisive action from our leaders, and so does the Catholic Church. Thank you."

I appreciate that question.\n\nFirst of all, let me just say that our relationship with Poland is an extremely important one, and that's why we've come to this region, to this part of the world. Poland, a close friend of America's, has played a vital role in the effort to bring freedom and stability to Europe. We're proud of our alliance, our NATO membership, and our commitment to NATO's expansion into Eastern Europe.\n\nNow, as it comes to the new relationship with Russia, I believe, and the United States believes, that the future of Russia should be in the hands of the Russian people, and we're committed to that. But we have to be very real, very clear, that Russia have to see progress, both in freedom and democracy, in human rights, to be a real and valued member of the community of nations.\n\nAnd this is where Poland and the United States, I believe, share a similar vision. Poland is an ally of the United States, and that's why this alliance means so much to us. Poland shares the vision of a strong and free Europe, a European union that is open, open to all nations. We want to see a Europe that it is stable, and free, where people can live with hope, where they can educate, where they can have economic growth, and where they can live without fear.\n\nAnd let me tell you, Ronald Reagan would be proud of Poland, because when we asked Poland to join the NATO in 1999, it took a lot of courage, but Poles made that decision to stand with America, to stand for freedom, and now Poland is proud of NATO membership, and we will ensure, and America will ensure that Poland will be protected, as this values are guaranteed."

The Iraqi people are moving forward in their history, and we're honored to be a part of that process.\n\nAs we work with the government and Prime Minister Allawi, our goal is to continue to support the sovereignty of Iraq while ensuring the security and stability of the region. \n\nFirst and foremost, we're committed to meeting our more fundamental obligations under UNSCR 1546, which calls for sustainable security and stability in Iraq. To ensure this goal, we're working closely with the Iraqi government and coalition partners on several key initiatives.\n\nFirstly, we're working to plug the gap between the Iraqi military's capabilities and our troop levels. We're actively evaluating our military posture in Iraq, looking for ways to reduce our footprint while still ensuring the security of the region. I must stress that this will not come at the cost of decreased security presence. We will continue to support the Iraqi security forces as they stand up to secure their country.\n\nSecond, we're working with the Iraqi government on a strategy to walk down our business assistance - in various forms of training, advice and capacity building - in areas like intelligence and counter-insurgency. We will work with them to secure their rights to their own destiny and will continue to increase the authority that resides within the Iraqi government.\n\nI must stress that this progress will be gradual. No transition of authority from the international community to the Iraqi government will happen magically, but we are hopeful that the return of a sovereign nation will radically alter it."

The bipartisan commission that was put together to look at intelligence reform made some very tough recommendations, and we're working hard to implement those recommendations. The bill that we proposed did have a lot of the elements that they suggested, but, of course, there were some differences.\n\nI believe Secretary Rumsfeld did his job the best he could with the information he had, and he's been a valuable member of my team. He's worked very hard to help us stay focused on our mission in Iraq and Afghanistan. I'm not going to second-guess him; he's not responsible for the intelligence failures, I am.\n\nAs for what I could have done differently, I've thought a lot about this, and I've talked to some of the members of Congress about it. I think one thing I might have done is spent more time summoning the patriotism and will to push this bill forward, but at the end of the day, it was still a tough bill, and it asked for a lot of change in an institution that's traditionally very proud and strong - and sometimes that can be difficult to change.\n\nAs for what this says about my ability to achieve my legislative agenda in the next two years, I'm not one to give up easy. I'm a fighter, and this just makes me more determined to get it done. I'm going to keep on working with Congress, working with members on both sides of the aisle, to get things done. We're going to move forward on these important issues. The American people are looking to us to tackle these big problems, and we're going to do just that."

It's been a while since we've spoken, but I appreciate his continued commitment to the cause.\n\nTo your question, the commitment to keep our troops in Iraq until the country is stable and secure is an ongoing process. It's a goal we strive for, but timelines are difficult to predict. Since I've taken office, there's been progress in Iraq - elections, a transition to Iraqi security forces, and a democratically elected government.\n\nNow, can we tell you exactly how long it's going to take? I'd say we're making progress, but we need to continue to work with the Iraqi government to build their capacity and to take the lead in their own country.\n\nTo help answer your question, there is still work to be done. The situation in Iraq is fragile, and our commitment to that nation remains strong. Fast forward a couple of years, and realistically, I do believe we can reduce our troop numbers or scale back our operations. Still, we're getting to a point where our focus can shift from combat to training and assistance. As for exact timelines and withdrawal dates, that remains a high-level strategic decision for the U.S. government.\n\nAs for Afghanistan, we still have a mission there. We will work to support President Karzai to strengthen his government and to fight the enemy."

They need to help end this conflict by telling Hizballah to stand down and disarm. They have been providing the funds and the support and the encouragement for Hizballah to carry out these attacks. The international community needs to send a clear message to the Syrians and the Iranians that this kind of behavior will not be tolerated.\n\nAnd I've been working closely with various leaders, including Prime Minister Olmert of Israel, to build a coalition to help pressure Syria and Iran to make their demands. Ultimately, it's a tough problem, but I remain hopeful that with our allies and the international community coming together, we can find a way to achieve a peaceful resolution.\n\nI wanna be clear: Hizballah needs to disarm, stop their attacks, and restore the sovereignty of Lebanon. And I think we can achieve that goal, but it's going to take a concerted effort from the international community, with a clear message to Syria and Iran that this kind of radical behavior won't be supported.\n\nI was in a meeting with Tony Blair just yesterday, we discussed how we could put more pressure on Iran to stop arming Hizballah, and I think it's a great opportunity for Europe and the United States to work together in responding to this crisis.\n\nOur goal is a cease-fire and a long-term cease-fire, one that will bring peace to Israel and the region, so that we can focus on achieving progress on a two-state solution in the Middle East, that will bring peace and stability to both Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nI still believe, this conflict is a symptom of a larger struggle in the Middle East between those who support freedom and those who support terror."

The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in the Gulf Coast was a tragedy of unimaginable proportions, and I want to start off by reaffirming our commitment to the people of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama who were affected by that storm.\n\nSince Hurricane Katrina, we've taken unprecedented steps to assist those impacted by the storm. We've provided over 125 billion dollars in aid to support the recovery efforts, including 84 billion dollars in direct grants to individuals and families affected by the storm. We've also provided billions of dollars for infrastructure repair and reconstruction, including the rebuilding of the levees, schools, hospitals, and critical infrastructure.\n\nWe've also worked closely with Governor Blanco and Governor Haley Barbour to establish a number of initiatives to help get people back on their feet, including the Road Home program, the Louisiana Priority Needs Assistance program, and the Private Sector Initiative. These programs have helped thousands of families rebuild their homes, restart their businesses, and get back to work.\n\nHowever, I'm well aware that much work remains to be done. We've committed an additional 110 billion dollars in supplemental funds from the federal government to continue the relief and recovery efforts. We're also working with state and local officials to finalize the design and construction of the new levee system, which will protect the people of New Orleans and the surrounding areas from future storms.\n\nOne of my top priorities has been to ensure that the situation in New Orleans doesn't happen again. That's why we established the Mississippi River and Tributaries (MR&T) Levee System, designed to provide greater protection against flooding. Additionally, we extended the federal assisted flood insurance program, making it easier for people to get affordable insurance and to help preserve the social fabric of our communities through programs like the Small Business Administration's disaster loans for entrepreneurs and small businesses to rebuild.\n\nI do want to say that we've made significant progress, but I know that more work needs to be done. We're committed to seeing this through, and we'll continue to work with Congress, the state and local officials, and the people of the Gulf Coast to ensure that their voices are heard and their needs are met."

This will help keep our countries safer and prevent individuals who would look to do us harm from crossing our borders unchecked.\n\nIf Canada doesn't comply with the deadline, it would indeed have significant consequences. The possibility of imposing penalties, travel restrictions, or even strengthening border security measures at the discretion of the US government remains a possibility. Canadians and traveling Americans who have the necessary documents to cross both sides of the border will have the easiest, hassle-free experience."

As for accepting their offer of negotiations ahead of their response, I'll be honest with you, I'm glad Iran's colleagues, Europeans and others, are working to facilitate these talks. I think progress could be made on some issues, then. But in order for this to be a successful negotiation, Iran must address the international community's concerns, its pursuit of nuclear development as well as other issues unfettered by a limiting of our scope for conversation until a decision is official made by them."

First, let me just say that I think it's in the best interest of the Lebanese people that we resolve this crisis peacefully, and I appreciate the efforts of Speaker Berri and other Lebanese leaders in seeking a peaceful resolution.\n\nRegarding the resolution that the UN Security Council passed last week, I must say that it's a balanced and fair resolution. It calls for the prompt withdrawal of Israeli forces, but also makes clear that Hizbollah must stop its rocket attacks, free the two Israeli soldiers, and allow the Lebanese government to exercise control over its territory.\n\nNow, as for the question of whether the Israeli troops should pull out immediately, I think that's a matter for the Israeli government to decide. The resolution we passed at the UN was carefully crafted to ensure that the Lebanese government takes responsibility for its own territory and that Hizbollah stops its attacks.\n\nOf course, I will be talking to a number of leaders in the Middle East, including Speaker Berri, in the coming days to encourage them to do what is necessary to achieve a peaceful resolution to this crisis. In fact, I've spoken with Secretary Rice, and she will be reaching out to Speaker Berri in the coming days to see if there's a way forward that can be made acceptable to all parties. But I must say, the Lebanese government has a great interest in setting up a sovereign government in its own territory, and that is essential for any lasting peace in the region."

The United States and the United Nations have a long-standing partnership based on a shared commitment to promoting peace, stability, and human rights around the world. While we may disagree at times on specific issues, we've always relied on the United Nations as a vital tool for promoting our interests and advancing our values.\n\nSecretary General Annan and I have had our differences, but I respect his commitment to the ideals of the United Nations. The challenges we're facing in Afghanistan, however, are complex and warrant a bilateral approach. Our commitment to rebuilding that country, ensuring security, and promoting democracy is unwavering, and we'll continue to work with our international partners, including the United Nations, to achieve those objectives.\n\nIn New York, I'm looking forward to discussing our concerns and working with the international community to address these global challenges. I'll be emphasizing America's commitment to our allies, our partners, and the United Nations itself, while also clearly articulating our vision for how we'll work together to tackle these pressing global issues.\n\nThe United Nations can be a powerful force for good, and the United States continues to be a strong supporter of this institution. We'll be working closely with Secretary General Annan and the U.N. members to make sure that international help is offered to key regions around the world, including Afghanistan, the Middle East, and the world's most troubled countries, to establish a more hopeful and peaceful future.\n\nWe're going into the General Assembly meetings with our friends, with our allies, and our partners to address these issues, while also working to strengthen the United Nations and reinvigorate its ability to meet the global challenges of the 21st century."

I agree that I'm the third Republican to heavily engage in talks with an uncooperative and uninterested nation.  My predecessors, particularly Mr. Nixon and President Reagan, dealt with the remnants of the Soviet Union who had ideologies not very dissimilar from ours, the unifying dissent for security in Europe and an idol-free ideology led America in pro-democratic development for decades.\n\nHowever, regarding sharing a face-to-face discussion with the leaders of Iran, I'd like to consider several reasons why a more cautious approach may be beneficial. Firstly, the history of Iran has resulted in more hostility and warmongering, greatly supported globally. Also, the weapons had traveled and support witnessed in countries such as Iraq in attempts to wreak havoc.\n\nIf I surround myself in vulnerabilities without going the integrity, skepticism from America overlaunches proposals will surely meet counter productive majorly undermining rather than generating productive answers.\nFurthermore, my policy of change to countertrip Iranian maneuvers\u2014Moving away to form and disagree as an expanding solution.

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you. Good morning, everybody. I appreciate your question.\n\nYou know, I believe the fundamental issue here is a concern about China's economic policies, and the impact they're having on our economy, and the global economy. Now, I'm a firm believer in free trade, and I believe in fair trade. And I think we need to make sure that China is playing by the same rules as the rest of us.\n\nNow, the issue of the yuan, or the renminbi, as they call it, is an issue that we're watching closely. The Chinese government has said that they're working on a currency reform plan, and we're watching closely to see the results of those actions. But I will tell you, we can't just rely on words - we need to see action.\n\nOur concern is not just about the value of the yuan, but the broader economic policies of China, including the levels of intervention and support that are being provided to various sectors within their economy. And I think we need to make sure that China is moving towards a more market-driven economy, rather than simply trying to prop up certain industries or sectors with government support.\n\nNow, in terms of trade duties, I'm open to exploring options that would help level the playing field for American businesses and workers. But I want to be careful not to overreact or engage in tit-for-tat trade wars, which would ultimately hurt both our economic interests and the global economy.\n\nSo, we'll continue to engage in diplomatic efforts with China, and we'll make sure that our economic policies are directed towards achieving a level playing field for American businesses and workers. And I'll work closely with Congress to make sure that any legislation or actions we take are in the best interests of our nation.\n\nNow, I know there are some in Congress who are pushing for quick action, and I respect their concerns and enthusiasm. But I think we need to take a more thoughtful and judicious approach to this, and make sure that we're not acting out of frustration, but out of a careful understanding of the broader economic picture."

While it's true that some of the sources we have at this time suggest that Iran may not be actively working towards a nuclear bomb, the consensus in this administration is that we still have concerns about Iran's intentions.\n\nThese concerns are not just about their actions four years ago; it's about their past behavior and a pattern of statements made by various Iranian officials, including President Ahmadinejad, about their aspirations for nuclear capability. As you know, I've made it very clear to the world that Iran will not be allowed to pursue a nuclear weapon. That's why we've worked in the United Nations Security Council to pass two resolutions calling on Iran to suspend its enrichment program.\n\nRegarding the military option, I want to be clear: we're not taking it off the table. We'll continue to evaluate all options and engage in diplomatic efforts to address this issue. However, I want to note that the US, together with our allies, has a strong preference for a diplomatic solution if possible. We have a 100% commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and if necessary, we'll take whatever measures are necessary to achieve that goal."

As I've said before, I was not personally involved in the decision to destroy the CIA interrogation tapes. I was not informed of that decision by my administration. However, I do know that the CIA is an independent agency, and I've been informed that they determined the tapes were, quote, \"not significant\" in the investigations.\n\nRegarding your question about the destruction of the tapes, I believe the decision was made in dooms of national security, and that's why Attorney General Gonzales and Brian Marshall had an analysis, and I believe that's why they were destroyed."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you.  I appreciate the question.  First, let me say that in this great nation of ours, we must lead by setting a clear vision for the future. We must be assertive in our foreign policy, because when America leads, we're not just pursuing our own interests, we're seeking to advance freedom and security for all peoples around the world. That's what the American people expect of their leaders.\n\nNow, being unilateral doesn't mean we're not working with our allies. We're working closely with our friends and partners, and under my leadership, we've strengthened our alliances, especially with NATO, the EU, and other democratic nations. The fact is, when America acts decisively to promote our values and our interests, it doesn't mean we're not working with our friends and partners. It simply means we're not reliant on their agreement to take necessary action.\n\nLeadership means taking a stand, making tough decisions, and sometimes, that means acting in the absence of international consensus. But I want to assure the American people, and our friends around the world, that we're not going it alone. We're always staying in close consultation with our allies and partners, because that's what this nation does best \u2013 we work together to solve common problems and promote a shared vision of peace, prosperity, and liberty for all humanity."

    "gen_response": "Thank you. I appreciate that question.\n\nOn Usama bin Laden, as you know, we've made significant progress in bringing the Taliban down, dismantling its al-Qaeda network in Afghanistan, and defeating its regime. However, I want to be clear, I'm not going to give any operational details that might put our troops in harm's way. What I will say is that we'll continue to squeeze, continue to cut off the supports, the financial, the logistical, and intelligence support, that terrorist networks require to carry out their evil plots.\n\nAs far as al-Qaeda leadership, I still believe that the core leadership of al-Qaeda, including Usama bin Laden, are probably hiding in Pakistan's tribal regions. However, I want to reiterate that bin Laden's not hiding with a ten-car motorcade; he's hiding with caveats with fanatical zealots who believe what he believes.\n\nIt's still a big operation to find someone like bin Laden. We do have credible intelligence that tells us where they might be, but finding them is a tough task. Our President-elect, the next administration, will likely continue this pursuit. Meanwhile, the United States will still keep that pressure on.\n\nAs for Saddam Hussein, as you know, we utterly defeated his military. Saddam's regime is, it's broken, and I believe that he, along with a great number of those in the regime, will be held accountable for the atrocities that he carried out for decades.\n\nOn reports that he might be hiding in Iraq, our intelligence is not consistent with that fact. We know for certain Saddam Saddam's hiding in a hole, but that's not Iraq, that's Tikrit in a hole. And we took care of that problem."

We've had a thorough investigation into the events leading up to 9/11. I appointed the 9/11 Commission to get to the bottom of what went wrong.\n\nWhile there were certainly some bureaucratic miscommunications and failures, I believe our administration took decisive action to address the threat posed by al-Qaeda and we executed a thorough and comprehensive response to the attacks. I think it's unfair to suggest that we misled the American people.\n\nNow, I accept responsibility for the security failures of 9/11. (pauses) If I had any inkling that we were going to be attacked in such a vicious manner, I would've taken more action to prevent it. We didn't know, though, we were hit by terrorists who had successfulconned flight schools and airlines to take place in this very brutal attack.\n\nNow when it comes to accountability, it's a lot easier for some folks to look in the rearview mirror and point fingers, but I believe our administration took some bold action to take out the people who attacked us. Bring back the Taliban, bring Osama bin Laden to justice, cutting down key al-Qaeda leaders.\n\nIf I'm being graded, I'd say we did a darn good job despite the failures that were there. We had a system that worked a bit, a lot of government departments were separate failed, but look at what we've accomplished."

Let me detail for you the U.S. position on the Israeli settlements.\n\nThe position of the United States has been clearly stated, and that is that the construction of new settlements in the West Bank beyond what existed at the beginning of the Oslo Accords in 1993 does not contribute to a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and therefore does not serve the cause of peace.\n\nHowever, we also have a strong commitment to the security of the Jewish people, and we recognize Israel's rights to appropriate actions of self-defense. I've been a strong supporter of Israel throughout my presidency, and we will continue to stand by Israel's right to defend itself.\n\nThe details to the answer of which specific settlements are we referring to however is in the nuances of our official policy and a subject of ongoing negotiations.

I have expressed my concerns to President Putin about his government's actions in countries around the world, especially the CIS and the region. I think it's fair to say that I have concerns about the intentions and ideology of his administration regarding the promotion of democracy and free markets.\n\nRegarding whether Russia's behavior has chilled relations with the United States, I would say that while our relationship is still an important one, there are certainly challenges we face. We have pressing issues to resolve together, such as counter-terrorism and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nI believe, however, that we have the foundation for a strong, long-term relationship with Russia, based on shared interests in peace and stability in the international order. But the road ahead won't be easy, and I think it's clear that both of our countries have important work to do in repairing our relationship.\n\nIn the meantime, we continue to be clear in our message to other countries and leaders around the world that we're committed to promoting democratic practices and institutions, and protecting our friends who are struggling to achieve or maintain their freedom and democracy."

apologize for the previous cluttered response, Mr. President.  Let's start again.\n\nYou asked where I am in the second term as it relates to race in America.\n\nFirst and foremost, I appreciate the fact that we can have this kind of discussion in this room today. We've made good progress in this country in addressing some of the racial issues of the past.  I believe we can continue to make progress, but it will take time, effort, and the involvement of all Americans.\n\nAs I mentioned in my inaugural address, one of my goals for this second term is to bring Americans together, to make sure that the blessings of liberty are available to all, regardless of the color of our skin. We'll continue to push for policies that promote opportunity and address these persistent gaps in education, employment, and other areas."

    "gen_response": "I appreciate your question, and I'm glad to take some time to address this important issue.\n\nFirst, I agree that pursuing peaceful nuclear power alternatives would be a big step forward for Iran, and we believe the Iranian people deserve better than to live under the shadow of a nuclear program that could threaten regional and international security.\n\nRegarding Chancellor Schroeder's assessment, I think it's an accurate statement. We need to recognize that Iran's concerns about energy security and other issues need to be addressed, and that can be done in a way that does not involve them pursuing a nuclear program. However, I must emphasize that Iran's support for terrorism and their development of ballistic missiles remains a cause for great concern.\n\nCan we have conversations with Iran without the United States re-engaging in direct bilateral talks with them?  Well, we have already had officials of our Department of State and other agencies sitting down with Europeans and others to discuss and go over some possible ways forward. But as I've said before, we're not averse to direct talks. There will come a time where we'll have to have conversations with Iran directly.\n\nI do want to emphasize, though, that the American position remains: we will use diplomacy to change their behavior, unless or until you see us take a more drastic measure. \n \nHowever, any American discussion or initiative will depend on America maintaining European unity with this problem and views of mandatory inspections of their nuclear enrichment facilities."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, good afternoon, and thank you for your question. I appreciate the passion and the commitment that PM Blair has shown on this issue. We share his desire to help alleviate the suffering of the people in Africa. However, when it comes to the issue of doubling U.S. aid, I believe we need to take a thoughtful and a strategic approach.\n\nWhile the U.S. is the largest provider of foreign assistance in the world, and our aid to Africa has increased significantly over the past few years, there are a couple of things we need to take into consideration. First, we cannot concentrate solely on the question of aid levels without considering the policy changes that are necessary to create a real and lasting impact in Africa.\n\nWe know that aid alone cannot solve the problems of Africa. To truly address poverty, malaria, HIV/AIDS, and other major issues on the continent, we need to focus on a comprehensive approach. This includes blocking illicit trading and Smuggling of counterfeit medicines. This includes creating an enabling environment for business and entrepreneurship to flourish. It includes addressing conflicts, promoting good governance, and improving our own international trade policies.\n\nThat being said, I am committed to working with Congress to increase our aid to Africa. In my State of the Union address, I proposed a $15 billion increase in aid to Africa over the next few years, bringing our total aid commitment to over $10 billion a year. That's a significant increase, and it reflects our commitment to the people of Africa.\n\nBut let me be clear, we need to be smart about how we send that aid and how we do business in Africa. We need to ensure that it's providing real results, whether it's helping to fight HIV/AIDS, increase access to clean water, or promote sustainable economic development.\n\nAnd finally, let me emphasize that we can't do it alone. The United States is not a blank check to the world. We need to be careful about how we use our taxpayer dollars, and we need to ensure that our foreign aid programs are serving the interests of the American people.\n\nSo while doubling U.S. aid to Africa is an interesting idea, we have a broader strategy that's focused on realism, pragmatism, and results. We're committed to partnering with PM Blair, with other G-8 nations, and with African leaders to make a difference in the lives of the people on the continent. Thank you."

Leslie, I believe that's the Vice President. We have discovered that global terror organizations are very sophisticated in their communication, and they're using all kind of technologies to thwart our intelligence efforts. We can't let that stop us, we've got to be able to find out what they're saying. The NSA program, the Terrorist Surveillance Program, is a counter-terrorism tool, designed to intercept communications between terrorists who are based in the country, and those who support them from abroad."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify our efforts in this area. I must remind you that the FISA law does play a significant role in ensuring that we, as a nation, can effectively protect ourselves from foreign threats.\n\nHowever, I believe we need to remember that since the original signing of that law in 1978, we're living in a completely new era \u2013 an era of global terrorism. Al-Qaeda has made it abundantly clear that they seek to strike at our soil.  The threats we face today from terrorism require a level of flexibility and cooperation with our allies that may not have been seen before.\n\nThe original FISA legislation, though a crucial tool, has limitations that make it difficult for us to obtain the intelligence we need to stay ahead of these plans to commit terror attacks. That's why the recent program we put in place \u2013 using the President's signing statements \u2013 is necessary to augment this outdated law."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for your question.  Now let me clarify, as the administration, we're committed to working with Congress to help alleviate the pressure on American families, especially when it comes to the price of gasoline. However, I'm concerned about any legislation that could impact oil production and the ability to meet our nation's demand for energy. Imposing a significant tax on oil companies' profits could certainly have unintended consequences on the industry. It could mean reduced investment in domestic production, and accordingly, less supply to meet our growing energy needs.\n\nWe've already taken steps to address this issue by increasing domestic oil production, and working to develop new technologies and alternative energy sources. I believe it's more productive to work with the industry to enhance transparency and make sure corporations are clearly disclosing their profit margins and their marketing practices, rather than simply a tax which could end up being passed on to the American consumers."

I've surrounded myself with good people who offer different perspectives, and I've taken to heart the lessons of history, as well as the good ideas from critics who are willing to offer them.\n\nOne example of an outside idea that's resonated with me is the notion of making the Surge in Baghdad and some of our other urban areas in Iraq more focused on securing neighborhoods and building working relationships with local leaders. A number of critics, including Senator Joe Biden and others, have suggested that we take a more neighborhood-based approach to the security effort. And I believe that's an excellent idea.\n\nIn fact, we're already building on that idea. We're not just just clearing neighborhoods; we're also trying to provide services, like training for Iraqi security forces, providing basic services, like electricity and water, so that people feel like their lives are improving. And we're reaching out to local leaders, Iraqi leaders, to get their support for the security operations and for the future of their communities.\n\nNow, let me be clear: this is just one idea, and we're still putting the final elements of our new strategy together. But I think it's a key component, and one that I'm going to continue to emphasize as we move forward."

    "gen_response": "Good afternoon, folks. I appreciate the question from the press. I've got some strong opinions on this, and I'm happy to share 'em with ya. Now, I'll give you a straight answer.\n\nFirst, raising the minimum wage, I think we need to be careful about that. We want to make sure that we're not hurtin' small businesses and jobs. I just don't know that a blanket increase across the board is the right way to go. I think we need to make sure we're creatin' an environment that's conducive to economic growth and adequate job creation.\n\nSecond, reducin' student loan interest rates, I think that's a tough issue. I understand that we want to make sure our young people are properly educated and can afford to go to college. Our education secretary, Rod Paige, and I have been lookin' at some alternatives. I'm open to discussion on how we can help these young folks, but I think we gotta be responsible about it, too.\n\nThird, broadening stem cell research, I strongly disagree with Speaker Pelosi on that one. I think we got to proceed with caution on that. As you know, stem cell research is a tough issue for me and for many Americans, but I think we can find common ground on it. We can pursue alternative sources of embryonic stem cells and non-controversial alternatives.\n\nAnd lastly, rollin' back tax cuts. We've got a good economy now, but I think those tax cuts have been essential to get us into this position. It's helped us balance our budget and encouraged business growth.\n\nNow, I know we've got some long, tough debates ahead of us. But let me tell you, I'm confident that we'll come out with solutions that are good for all Americans, not just one party or another. Thank you, and I'm happy to take more questions."

Now, when it comes to Nancy Pelosi and our relationship, I've always believed in working with members of Congress who, even if we disagree, are willing to work towards the greater good. \n\nAs the President, it's my job to reach out to members of Congress on both sides of the aisle and find common ground. While I've had some...lively exchanges with the Speaker, I've always tried to respond to her concerns in good faith, even when we don't see eye to eye on an issue. We've had our differences, but I still believe we can work together on certain key issues that benefit the American people."

    "gen_response": "To those critics at home, I share their frustration and concern, I really do. I want a change in Iraq just as much as they do, but we need to be smart about how we make that change. \n\nThe surge, as some people call it, isn't a soundbite-friendly name, but it is a necessary increase in troops in order to give General Petraeus, our commander in Iraq, the resources he believes are needed to carry out his strategy to secure Baghdad and then move out to the rest of the country.\n\nMake no mistake, we are not naive about the challenges we face, and I know that some of my fellow citizens and some of you in the press have doubts, but I believe the surge is working, and we will not give up now. We'll continue to give General Petraeus and our troops the time and the chance to make this work.\n\nIn September, I will report to Congress on the effectiveness of the surge, based on the best advice of our military and civilian advisers. Before that report, I think it would be premature to start changing course, though I recognize that there may be differences within the Republican party and perhaps among Democrats about how we proceed.\n\nAs a nation, we must resist the temptation to abandon our effort now, just as we did in Vietnam, in Beirut, and in Somalia, we must stay the course and not cut and run."

We've got a lot of work to do to make sure our economy is growing, and I'm committed to doing just that.\n\nNow, I did talk to Senator McCain yesterday, and I told him that we're in this together, as Americans. And I told him that we can't let the politics get in the way of our common goal: to make sure our economy is strong and our country is prosperous. We need to work together, to make sure we're doing everything we can to help American families and small businesses weather this storm.\n\nI'm committed to making the tough decisions, to take the necessary action to get our economy moving again. I haven't ruled out additional action to stimulate growth, to create jobs. And I'm working closely with the Congress, with Senator McCain, and with other leaders to get that done.\n\nBut let me be clear: I'm not going to let the American people down.

My administration is committed to the Good Friday Agreement, which has brought a measure of peace to the region. We recognize the importance of a united, stable, and peaceful Northern Ireland as we move forward.\n\nTo answer your question directly, I can tell you that we are engaged, but we're taking a thoughtful, nuanced approach to the situation. We're working closely with the parties involved, including the governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland, to ensure that we're not just reacting to events, but rather, we're trying to lead and drive a process that promotes lasting peace.\n\nNow, I'll tell you that we've had some movement on the ground in Northern Ireland. There have been some notable developments, and we're working through various mechanisms, like the St Andrews Process, to encourage further progress. But we're not in a rush to get to a point where we feel like we need to take a more...unilateral approach.\n\nIn terms of comparison to the Clinton administration, I think it's unfair to make a direct comparison. We're operating in a very different environment, in a post-9/11 world. We've had to focus on the war on terror and other pressing global priorities, but our commitment to this issue remains strong.\n\nRegarding your question about the Prime Minister, I'm not aware of any...

I've made it clear that Saddam Hussein's regime is a threat not only to the stability of the Middle East but to the security of America itself.\n\nOf course, there are those in my administration who have expressed concerns about mining states out there who harbor and support terrorism. And in terms of public opinion, I understand your point but I implore all of you to keep in mind that public opinion is a delicate balance, but more importantly it depends on the situation and we will have the tough discussions and work together with the American people as to the way forward.\n\nNow, I'd be happy to take your follow-up question.

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you. I'm glad to address your questions.\n\nFirstly, regarding the Middle East, I believe we have made significant progress in this region, particularly with respect to Iraq. The removal of Saddam Hussein has given the Iraqi people an opportunity to take their first steps towards democracy. We continue to support the interim government in its efforts to establish a constitutional process, and we hope that the Palestinian elections will be free and fair.\n\nHowever, it's difficult to predict what can be accomplished before the Palestinian elections. The $50 million we provided for the Palestinian Authority's reform efforts will help, but we want to see more accountability within their government. Mahmoud Abbas, the new Palestinian leader, has made commitments to reform, but we'll be watching closely to make sure he follows through.\n\nNow, regarding anti-Semitism sweeping across Europe, this is a disturbing trend that I share your concern about. The vile rhetoric and the violent attacks on Jewish communities across the continent cannot be tolerated. We stand firmly with our European friends and allies in condemning these actions.\n\nThe rise of anti-Semitism in Europe is a symptom of broader issues - globalization, immigration, and economic uncertainty, I believe. But we also can't ignore the fact that some European societies have had a longer history of anti-Semitism than we have here in America. We must not judge America by the standard of some European countries. \n\nHere in the United States, we are witnessing a rising tide against some life, as killings and Lunacy rise. \"Nobody's better to me than the Jewish people.\" We are building on this foundation of tolerance and compassion to ensure that our Jewish communities are safe. That's one of the reasons I host\u00a0Holocaust and Human Rights Awareness Week annually.\n\nJust as we cannot merely watch, here we can set an example and be part of this solution.  In this country and against in the ideals we hold sacred we should stand _______________________.\n\nMoving forward, we will counter this emerging Holocaust resurgence in Europe. We condemn in the strongest possible terms these heinous and horrific views. Those anti-Semitic acts won't be condemned, and never have been, will not go unpunished.

We've got folks who've been trained by al-Qaeda, who've been involved in the Taliban, who have taken innocent lives.

    "gen_response": "Good afternoon, thank you for the question. I understand why some Americans might have concerns about the situation in Iraq and the message I'm sending. But let me tell you, the great American people are a skeptical people by nature, and I respect that. But I'm here to tell you, after careful consideration, after hearing from our military commanders, after discussing this with my advisors, I firmly believe that the invasion of Iraq was the right decision for our national security.\n\nThis is not just about Iraq; it's about the broader threat that Saddam Hussein posed to America and the world. His regime was a state sponsor of terrorism, had weapons of mass destruction, and was a destabilizing force in the region. We removed him, and now his successors, the Iraqi people, are fighting for their own freedom, for their own way of life.\n\nNow, I know that the process has been tough, and I've acknowledged that. We've suffered losses, and it's been a difficult road. But I firmly believe that the long-term consequences of not acting earlier would have been disastrous for this great nation. We would have faced a mass release of WMDs, loss of credibility on the international stage, and possibly worse, possibly much worse.\n\nSo, I don't think Americans can or should trust my judgment on this solely based on politics. They should look at the facts, they should look at the evidence, and they should consider the inherent risks we faced. And I believe, in the end, they'll believe that, despite the difficulties we're facing now, the greatest threat to America's security was the removal of Saddam Hussein and his instruments of terror.\n\nBut I want you to know this, I take no satisfaction in having to say that there's more work to do. We underestimated the security challenge in Iraq, and for that, I apologize. But we've also set a goal of securing the country, training the Iraqi security forces, and we're making progress. So, let me say it one more time: this is a tough fight, and it will continue to be a tough fight, but I'm confident in the strength and resilience of the American people and our military.\n\nSo, I believe that if you look at the record of this administration, if you look at our decisions, you'll see that we've made some tough choices, we've faced some tough realities, and we've acted based on our values and our interests. And that's what I'm going to keep doing, that's what I promise the American people."

In this case, the UN will be providing a South Korean-led peacekeeping force and it was the decision of the United Nations, not a decision made by this administration or the U.S. that there would be no U.S. troops involved."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for that question. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify my position. Now, I understand that some of the critics of our mission in Iraq do draw parallels with the Vietnam conflict, and I accept that. However, I strongly believe that those comparisons are not entirely fair.\n\nFirst and foremost, the circumstances, the context, and the goals of our mission in Iraq are significantly different from those in Vietnam.  We are not an occupying force seeking to divide and rule. We are the liberators of a nation that is being oppressed, a nation that is seeking freedom from a brutal dictator.\n\nUnlike Vietnam, Saddam Hussein's Iraq had a long history of aggression, had used weapons of mass destruction against its own people, and had provoked multiple wars with its neighbors. We were not seeking to install a puppet regime, as some may have suggested in Vietnam. We were seeking to provide freedom and democracy to the Iraqi people, and that's exactly what we've done.\n\nFurthermore, the way we're fighting this war is different. We have the benefit of modern technology, the benefit of international cooperation, and the benefit of learning from the lessons of history. We've made a commitment to the people of Iraq to help rebuild that country, to help establish a stable and secure government, and to withdraw our troops when the Iraqi military is capable of standing on its own two feet.\n\nNow, I know some critics say that we can't win this war, that we're bogged down, that we're losing. But I strongly disagree with that. Our strategy is making progress. We're successfully disrupting the enemy's ability to launch attacks. The level of violence is not as high as it once was. And I believe we're making significant strides towards creating a stable, democratic Iraq.\n\nNow, I'm not naive. I know we still face challenges. There are still terrorists out there who want to harm us and our allies. But I am confident in the mission, I'm confident in our troops, and I'm confident in our strategy. And I believe the American people will come to see the same thing.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I don't think it's fair to compare this war directly to Vietnam. It's a distinct, different challenge, and I'm confident we're meeting that challenge."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you. That's a very thoughtful question. Yes, reflecting on the course of action that led us to where we are today has certainly been a major component of our planning process. I've always said that we reform in times of peace and prosperity but prepare for war. But we, of course, have been in a period of conflict, and I think it's essential that we take a hard look at our actions and our decisions over these past five years.\n\nYou know, I took office with a very clear vision for this country, a vision of keeping America safe and securing freedom for the Iraqi people. We believed that Saddam Hussein was a threat to that, and the United Nations doubts about Saddam's disarmament process and our intelligence on that were compelling.\n\nIn retrospect, I can say that the emphasis we placed on certain elements of our planning, such as the work of our military to disarm and secure Iraq, has borne out successful outcomes. But our work has not been without its challenges. Terrorists inside Iraq, sectarian violence \u2013 we underestimated that. I've also come to recognize that nation-building is not a quick fix.\n\nNow, some might term it 'quagmire,' but I see it as a nation-building effort. The situation we face is complex. Still, in the end, it's all worth it. Real progress is being made to have a stable, free Iraq that's a safe haven for the West.\n\nIn light of these hard-won lessons and what we've learned, we have made improvements in our process for the future, our way forward. We're building a more forward and long-sighted foreign policy."

In November, my goal was to express support for Prime Minister Maliki and the progress that's being made in Iraq. At that time, I thought he was a strong leader who shared our commitment to a unified and democratic Iraq. However, I've also been clear that Iraq's progress has been uneven, and that we need more action from the Iraqi government in terms of building trust among different ethnic and sectarian groups, not just sectarian groups like the Shia, Sunnis, and Kurds, attacking one another, but addressing the root causes that led to this war in the first place.\n\nNow, I understand why you'd be critical of the current situation. I am too. But I still believe that Prime Minister Maliki is a key player in this process. I also believe that our strategy and the efforts of our brave men and women serving in Iraq are, indeed, producing results. We've increased the security in Baghdad, we've reduced the violence, and we've set conditions that'll allow the Iraqis to govern themselves effectively.\n\nHowever, I also believe that our goal is not just to replace a government or a person, my goal is to have a stable, democratic government that can ensure that Iraq has a future without conflict and without tyranny. Prime Minister Maliki, like any leader, has his strengths, and he has his weaknesses. So, in light of recent events, I have made it clear to him that the keys of progress in this region depend on his ability to work with the other major groups and his ability to move an inclusive agenda forward.\n\nBut to answer your question, I still believe that Maliki has a crucial role to play in Iraq's future, and I'm confident that he'll make the necessary changes to ensure a more inclusive and unified Iraq."

Your actions are not merely beneficial to your own interests in the region, but they put American lives in harm's way, and that is unacceptable. The international community needs Iran to change its behavior, and we urge the Iranian government to cease all support to these groups and to cooperate with the international community in rooting out illicit trade of weapons.\n\nTo that end, I'll continue working with our international partners in the United Nations Security Council and elsewhere to ensure that diplomatic pressure is applied on Iran to bring an end to these actions and bring them into compliance with international norms and expectations."

Mexico is a crucial neighbor and an important friend. By engaging directly with President Fox, we'll be working to build a more secure and stronger relationship between the United States and Mexico, in terms of trade, border security, and counter-narcotics efforts.\n\nNow, let me tell you, this doesn't mean we're not going to engage deeply with our European and Canadian allies. I intend to meet with leaders from Europe and Canada in the very near future as well. My trip to Mexico is not a substitute for engaging with our traditional allies in Europe and Canada. But by getting out front on this critical neighborhood issue, we'll actually strengthen our ability to work with those very same allies on issues like counter-terrorism, non-proliferation, and economic growth.\n\nIn fact, a strong and stable relationship with our Mexican neighbors has got to be at the heart of our own national security and economic prosperity. Now, I also want to clarify that our neighborhood diplomacy is an invitation to those countries of the Western Hemisphere to share in this effort, with a view towards our shared values of democracy, freedom, and markets.\n\nAnd that's part of this broad-based goal we have to bring the Western Hemisphere closer together, including countries from the Caribbean, to cooperate on a more democratic partnership idea, in support of advancing economic and social reform."

The intelligence has shown us that Saddam Hussein's regime poses a significant threat to regional stability and to the national security of the United States. We've made it clear that our mission is to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat the Al-Qaeda network, including Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq.\n\nNow, as to how we might go about achieving regime change, we've explored various options. However, all the non-military options, including diplomacy and United Nations efforts, have been exhausted. Saddam Hussein has consistently demonstrated that he's not interested in returning to the '91 Gulf War conditions, and that it seems he's willing to pursue and pursue next-generation missile capabilities, nuclear-weapons technology, chemical and biological agents, and a significant cache of \u2013 a significant arms-holding stockpile that, in the wrong hands, would be a threat.\n\nSo, the potential for armed force-ex- military action may be an option. However, any military operation would be carried out with international cooperation and would meet all the necessary requirements that would minimize civilian harm.\n\nRegarding Osama bin Laden, and particularly Danny Pearl, we desire the safe release of all Americans being held by their captors. We are working closely with the Pakistani government, in particular, to see that the usual capture of terrorists will result in the safe release of Americans.\n\nThere are uncertainties about the current status of Danny Pearl, and while we wish we could provide more definitive information, we will do everything in our power to keep good efforts attuned to search for his safe return."

While we continue to make very good progress in the health field, we don't want to rush into vaccinating every American without careful consideration.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services are following a recommended guideline to provide the vaccine to first responders and health care workers who are at a heightened risk, given their position of direct contact with patients who may be exposed to smallpox. \n\nI understand the sense of individual freedom and personal choice that drives your question, but the American people should be assured that their health and safety is our top priority. The risks associated with the smallpox vaccine can be very significant, and we're taking time to assess how and to whom the vaccine should be administered.\n\nWe want to be mindful that rolling out a whole nation-wide vaccine program would require the public's approval. We've seen in the past instances where people have concerns when they're not provided with all knowledge about whether the vaccine is a safe one to take and various people may have high concerns of vaccine side effects. However I am positive that our healthcare services available to all Americans will provide the expertise for citizens to make their own decision.\n\nSo, I think we have to strike a balance between offering vaccines to those who are at particular risk and who need to be protected right away, versus making this available to every single American. We'll continue to reassess our strategies and procedures to determine the best course of action and I will keep the American people well-informed throughout."

We're committed to promoting peace, stability, and democracy in the region, and we're willing to work with nations that share our interests.\n\nNow, I understand that some may perceive our policy as pro-Israeli, and that's understandable, given the long-standing relationship we share with the Jewish people, based on millennia of struggle against persecution and the historic creation of the State of Israel. But let's not forget that our policy in the region is aimed at peace and stability, not just with Israel, but with the other nations in the Middle East.\n\nIt's also essential to recognize that the War on Terror is about more than just a geographic location or a particular people \u2013 it's about a commitment to our values of freedom, human rights, and the defeat of extremist ideologies that threaten our security and the security of our allies.\n\nNow, I'd like to add that we've been working hard to ensure that our actions are guided by international law and the principles of fairness, justice, and equality for all people. We value our dialogue with Muslim leaders and faith communities, and we appreciate the many courageous voices speaking out against extremism and radicalism.\n\nRegarding our policy in the Middle East, I would say that we've supported Arab countries' democratic reforms, investments in education and economic development, and opportunities for social and economic growth, all in the name of building a more hopeful future for the people in this region. We believe that these efforts will help undermine the root causes of terrorism and encourage moderation and cooperation.\n\nUltimately, our goal is to create a Middle East where all nations enjoy peace, security, and the ability to build prosperous futures without being threatened by extremist groups. We'll continue working with people of all faiths and nations to achieve that goal.\n\nThank you, and I'm happy to take any follow-up questions."

It's about giving the Iraqi people a chance at democracy, at freedom, as I said, we believe that freedom is universal, and it's -- it's a right that every person on this earth deserves.\n\nNow, I know there are those who say that we should simply let the Iraqis handle their own affairs, but I say that's not a compassionate position. We had a responsibility to act, to help them build a new government, to help them build their institutions, to help them bring education and healthcare to their people.\n\nNow, regarding the oil, it's a very simple proposition. We're not going in there to exploit Iraq's oil resources. We're going in there because we have a mutual interest in stability and security in the region. We're going in there to help the Iraqi people develop their own resources, in a way that benefits all the people of Iraq, not just their leaders.\n\nAnd let me make it very clear, we will be working with the Iraqi government to develop their oil resources, in a way that benefits the Iraqi people, the Iraqi economy, and our allies around the world. We'll have the UN involved, other nations, to make sure that this is done for the benefit of the people, not just a select few.\n\nAnd as for the accusations that this is about oil, I say it's a cheap shot, it's not true. I've used the proceeds from this oil, that's not received by our government, to invest in the Iraqi people, to help them build for the future, and to help them move forward in a positive direction.\n\nWe're making significant progress, we're making progress in Iraq. We're making progress in the war on terror. We're making progress in promoting freedom and democracy around the world.

However, we've also made it clear to the Israelis that their settlement expansion activities are not helpful to the peace process.\n\nAs for the barrier, we understand Israel's security concerns, but we also believe that the barrier's route should be modified to be as Palestinians as it is for Israelis. Our Secretary of State, Colin Powell, has had discussions with both parties, and we will continue to press for a barrier that is not a barrier to achieving the goal of a secure and contiguous Palestine.\n\nNow, as for how Egypt can help, President Mubarak and I have talked about this. Egypt has played a key role in the Arab Peace Initiative, which we consider a positive step towards a two-state solution. We've encouraged Egypt to continue its efforts to urge the other Arab states to recognize Israel and support a two-state solution.\n\nEgypt can help by pressuring the other Arab nations to support this position, and we appreciate President Mubarak's efforts in this regard.

Moving forward, we must adapt our strategy to the new realities on the ground.\n\nThat's why I'm considering significant changes, as recommended by the Iraq Study Group and other experts. This includes a shift towards a more political and diplomatic approach to stabilize the country, which includes a Congressionally-mandated deadline for U.S. troops to begin redeploying from Iraq by 2008, though we still need more negotiating actions with all Iraqi parties if possible.\n\nWe cannot fight an enemy who responds to violence with more violence, but we can wage a philosophical battle against sectarian Al-Qaeda who are of the categories of rejected by extremist divisions in an Iraq secularist based republic and gain the trust of the people who share values of civil rights, equal opportunity, freedom and freedom of worship.\n\nThat's the road we'll take, and we'll continue to reassess our strategy and adjust it as necessary to meet the challenges we face.\n\nThat concludes my response, in the spirit of the Iraq Study Group's candid recommendations.

By the way, I'd like to correct you, we were asked to host this meeting in Washington, not to undermine, but in keeping with our responsibilities as a leader in the region.\n\nAs for Kyoto, I've made it clear from the very beginning that I believe the treaty was flawed, not necessarily for its environmental aims, but for its private sector infantile assumptions.  The United States has always been committed to an integrated and balanced package of commitments, not a separate treaty that asks only developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWhile we have agreed to continue research and cooperation to address climate change, I still have some doubts about Kyoto.  We find it unfair that the treaty burdens developing countries less, even those like China, with practically no greenhouse gas reductions, but pays little attention to development or economic impact.\n\nI share John Howard's view, tackling climate change requires a  comprehensive approach that encourages voluntary action, technological innovation, and international cooperation, while taking into account the legitimate concerns and responsibilities of all countries, neither punishing them nor ignoring them."

Economists that I've spoken to would say that we have, in fact, been in recession, but technically, by the standards of the National Bureau of Economic Research, we're not in a recession yet.  I want to emphasize, though, that none of that matters to the families who are feelin' the pinch at the pump or at the grocery store.\n\nNow, regarding my visit with our allies in Saudi Arabia, I'll be meetin' with King Abdullah to discuss a variety of issues, including energy stability and security. I've been makin' it clear to Saudi leaders, and to other major oil-producing nations, that high energy prices are a barrier to the recovery of the global economy.  And I firmly believe that increased supply would help ease these costs for American families.\n\nWe've seen some positive signs, by the way, that OPEC is gradually increasin' production. And I'm confident that, together with our allies, we can continue to work towards a more stable energy market that benefits the free world."

As I stand here today, I want to be clear: my administration is committed to making tough decisions and taking bold action to address the challenges facing our nation. I understand the concerns about energy prices and the economy. High prices at the pump and a long-term threat of dependency on foreign oil are unacceptable to me and to the American people.\n\nDuring my presidency, we will take decisive action to increase domestic production of energy, expand the use of alternative energy sources, and reduce our reliance on foreign oil. This will not be easy, and there will be challenges along the way. But I am confident that, with your resolve, the hard work of the American people, and the innovative spirit of the private sector, we can overcome these challenges.\n\nIn terms of the economy, we will also take steps to promote strong economic growth, boost job creation, and reduce the national debt. We will spur innovation, encourage entrepreneurship, and support small businesses and farmers. And we will restore the foundation of sound fiscal policy by balancing our budget, reducing taxes, and eliminating wasteful government spending.\n\nNow, as for responsibility, I want to be clear: we will take responsibility for our actions, but I expect the American people to take responsibility for their own future. Americans have always risen to the challenge, worked together, and overcome adversity. And it is our collective effort that will drive progress, not just the actions of one person or one administration.\n\nIn the end, my goal is not to shift the blame or to make promises we cannot keep.

We're making good progress, and I'm hopeful that we can complete this agreement by the end of the year.\n\nAs for the subject of a greater U.S. military presence in Spain, I'm not aware of any specific proposal to increase our troop presence there.  We do have a significant military presence in Spain, at the Rota air base near Sevile and the Moron air base near Seville.  Both bases serve strategic purposes and play important roles in our military operations.\n\nHowever, the decision to increase our military presence in Spain would depend on a number of factors, including the defense needs of our country, the contributions we need from allies in the War on Terror, and our overall military strategy.  At this time, I'm not aware of any plans to expand our presence in Spain beyond what we currently have in place.\n\nI want to assure the American people and the Spanish people that our two nations will continue to work closely together on a wide range of issues, including defense, trade, and counter-terrorism, to further strengthen our strategic partnership and advance our shared interests and values.

In that effort, we've taken deliberate actions against countries and groups that harbor, fund, or support these terrorists. In the War on Terror, our goal is to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat these organizations.\n\nAs we consider our military options and the tools at our disposal, we look for options that would deter our enemies, while causing minimal collateral damage. We take our responsibility as a nuclear power very seriously, and our commitment to non-proliferation and disarmament is firmly on track.\n\nIn 2001 we held a review of U.S. nuclear policy, where we looked at the role of nuclear deterrent in our security policy. This thought effort, Nuclear Posture Review, identified certain long-term strategies concerning potential regional crises. We are thinking about conventional exchanges as options between states under certain, rather extraordinary conditions."

And I believe it's essential to make it clear that our policy in Iraq is separate from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We're not using the Middle East peace process as leverage to try to get support on Iraq, nor are we linking our support for Israel to our support for the so-called \"regime change\" policy in Iraq.\n\nIn fact, our message to all the Arab leaders is that we're strong advocates for peace in the Middle East, and that we believe a stable, secure, and democratic Iraq, with Saddam no longer in power, actually will help to promote peace in the region. We believe that if we can show that democracy can work in Iraq, that will send a powerful message to the other nations of the region about the potential for change.\n\nOf course, I know that some in the region are skeptical about our motives, and we understand that.

He's done an outstanding job serving our nation, and I appreciate his professionalism.  However, in this instance, I respectfully disagree with his assessment.\n\nAs we've gathered more intelligence and information, we've come to a different conclusion. I strongly believe that Saddam Hussein's regime poses a grave threat to the United States, to our interests, and to the region's stability.  We have evidence that he willfully ignores the United Nations' 11 resolutions calling for him to disarm and provide definite access to inspectors to embarrass his weapons programs.\n\nWhile I share the concern about the potential for increased terrorism from a post-Hussein Iraq, I also believe it's possible, even likely, that Saddam's use or movement of WMDs and their conveyance would increase the threat, especially given his already stated intent to harm our nation and our close allies.\n\nThe U.S. government will continue to consider all intelligence and keep the American people, Congress, and our allies informed as the situation develops.

There is evidence that Saddam Hussein's regime was behind the recent attacks against our troops and against the Polish soldiers who were brave enough to stand alongside us in this noble endeavor.\n\nNow, as for whether these attacks will decrease or increase in the short term, we have to be prepared for anything. We know that Saddam's loyalists and remnants of his regime will not give up without a fight, and they will attempt to wage a guerrilla war against our coalition forces.\n\nHowever, I am confident that the Iraqi people are determined to see their country move towards freedom and democracy, and I have faith in the bravery and determination of our men and women in uniform. We will continue to work closely with the new Iraqi government to root out the remaining pockets of resistance and to bring stability to the region.\n\nIn the short term, I would expect the situation on the ground to remain challenging, but I am optimistic about our progress and the promise of a brighter future for the Iraqi people.

First, let me say that I've spoken with Prime Minister Blair several times about the idea of a Middle East conference, and I think it's an interesting idea. Before we commit to a conference, we need to see some progress on the Quartet Roadmap, which includes a clear and representative government in the Palestinian Authority, the end of violence, and a commitment from the Arab states to help broker a solution.\n\nWe also need to see some progress on the security issues, ensuring that all parties understand that there can be no terror. The Palestinian Authority must be able to demonstrate its ability to prevent terror, and Hamas and Hezbollah must be disarmed.\n\nAdditionally, we need to see a commitment from the Israeli government to freeze settlements and to work towards a two-state solution. So, we're looking for some real progress before we sign on to any international conference.\n\nRegarding an envoy, I'm considering it, but we need to see who's going to be able to get the right results for the United States. If we're going to have an envoy, it's going to be someone with a good understanding of the situation and the ability to really make progress.\n\nNow, on the trip, I'll be visiting Europe with first lady Laura and a bipartisan delegation of members of Congress.

That may require greater federal involvement in the response and recovery efforts, especially in areas where the states and local governments may not have the resources or capacity to handle the crisis on their own. \n\nI've spoken to my team, and we're looking at a number of measures to enhance our disaster preparedness, including investments in infrastructure, better coordination between federal agencies, and more support for emergency planning and response capabilities at the state and local level.\n\nRegarding Russia and Iran, I had a productive conversation with President Putin last night. I expressed our concerns about the situation in Iran and the need for them to be brought to the United Nations Security Council. I believe Russia shares our interest in preventing the spread of nuclear proliferation, and we're working together to nail down the details of how we can move this forward."

I've taken responsibility for the federal response, and I've taken steps to ensure that we're doing everything in our power to support the people of the Gulf Coast.\n\nThe $110 billion in federal aid that Congress provided has been a major boost, and I'm proud of the work that's been done by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Army Corps, and other federal, state, and local agencies. The number of people who have received aid, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Supplemental Security Income, and other forms of assistance, has exceeded expectations.\n\nHowever, I know that more work remains to be done. The people of the Gulf Coast are still recovering, and our priority is to ensure that they have the resources they need to rebuild their lives and their communities.\n\nWe've established a number of programs to help those who are still struggling, including the Road Home program to assist with housing, and the HOPE VI program to support revitalization efforts in low-income housing. We've also provided resources for small businesses and farmers to help them recover and rebuild.\n\nBut I've also learned a lesson from Katrina, that we must learn from our mistakes and adapt. That's why we've implemented new reforms at FEMA to improve our disaster preparedness and response.\n\nSo, are the results acceptable? We're making progress, but I wouldn't say they're acceptable yet.

We're seeing sectarian violence, we're seeing guerrilla attacks, and we're seeing the will of the Iraqi people to determine their own destiny opposed by those who seek to disrupt that great dream of democracy.\n\nWhile I would not describe the situation in Iraq as a civil war in the classical sense, I do believe that we're seeing a collapse of law and order in certain parts of the country. There is no doubt that the sectarian violence and the terrorist attacks are taking a heavy toll on the Iraqi people and we're working closely with our Iraqi partners to get the security situation under control.\n\nThe Prime Minister's words on Sunday sounded a warning bell, and I agree with his assessment. The violence is unacceptable, and it's our intention to support him and the Iraqi people in trying to bring this violence to an end. We will not diminish the efforts of the Iraqi government and its security forces, nor will we withdraw support.

    "gen_response": "Thank you for your question. I agree with you that the idea of a absolutely zero threshold of violence is unrealistic. The nature of insurgencies and terrorist movements is that they will continue to try to use violence, even if the underlying conditions in a given society begin to improve.\n\nHowever, we've always said that security in Iraq will be a relative measure. As Iraqi security forces become stronger, as they continue to grow in capacity and capability, we do anticipate that the security situation will improve. And as that happens, we'll be able to adjust our troop levels based on that improved security.\n\nTo give you a sense of how that might play out, I've always said that once the Iraqi security forces are able to govern and secure their own regions, and we see some stability in key areas, that's when we can start to reduce our troop levels. Now, as to how much that reduction would be in any given month, that will be based on the situation on the ground. But I do believe that we're making good progress in building up the Iraqi security forces and they're getting stronger every single day.\n\nIt's also worth noting that our strategy in Iraq, the surge strategy, is designed to produce a level of security that we can certify to the American people, that we're making progress and that we believe that we have a pathway forward. So, we'll be watching very closely the security situation, and we'll be making adjustments based on that.

The concept of amnesty for insurgents, I believe, is an interesting one. The insurgents, many of whom have engaged in acts of violence and terror against the Iraqi people and coalition forces, need to understand that their actions will have consequences. However, I also believe that those who renounce violence and are willing to take a stand for peaceful transition may be eligible for amnesty.\n\nAs a matter of law, this is something that would need to be decided by the Iraqi government, and I have confidence in Prime Minister Allawi and the interim government to make decisions that are in the best interests of the Iraqi people. But, I do think that as Iraq moves forward towards a more peaceful and stable government, there needs to be an opportunity for reconciliation, for people to put the past behind them and move forward.\n\nRegarding the oil resources, that's a very important question. I do support the idea of a system that ensures that the people of Iraq receive a fair share of the revenue generated by their oil, and that includes the Sunnis, Shia, and Kurds.\n\nThere have been suggestions that we could guarantee the Sunnis a share through a percentage breakdown, through a law or a constitutional provision. I think this is something that's worth exploring, and I've spoken to Prime Minister Allawi about it. It's one of the reasons why I supported an interim constitution that included provisions for a federal system, with power devolved to the regions, including the governance of oil.\n\nHowever, I also believe that this is something that will need to be worked out by the Iraqis themselves. The Iraqis need to work out the details of their own oil laws, their own constitutional arrangements. We can provide guidance and support, but ultimately, the decision is theirs.\n\nWe're not advocating for any one particular percentage or formula. What we want to do is ensure that the people of Iraq receive the benefits of their own resources, that they're not subject to exploitation or, conversely, that the oil revenue doesn't only benefit a select few. And I think that's what the interim government has been focusing on, and we'll continue to do our best to support them in this effort."

However I still believe that removing Saddam Hussein and dismantling his regime is the right decision for the American people, and for the people of Iraq.

I think that shift is mainly due to one sinister narrative - that somehow I and my administration knowingly misled the American people. I've always been upfront with the American people.

    "gen_response": "Thank you for that question. The situation in Iraq is indeed complex and fluid, and I appreciate the opportunity to clarify our position on this matter.\n\nYou're right that the terms \"civil war\" and \"insurgency\" have been used to describe the violence and instability in Iraq. While technologically, a civil war is generally understood as a domestic conflict involving two or more factions within a country's own military or population, the use of the label can depend on perspective.\n\nFrom our perspective, the primary objective of our mission in Iraq is to help the Iraqis defend their young democracy and establish a secure environment. We're working closely with Prime Minister Maliki and other Iraqi leaders to combat al-Qaeda, the remnants of Saddam's regime, and other terrorist groups that aim to undermine stability and spread hatred and fear.\n\nIf, however, you characterize the situation as a civil war, I'm concerned that it might give the impression that we're engaged in a sectarian conflict. We're demonstrating our commitment to Iraqi sovereignty and the unity of the Iraqi people, while the terrorists want to exploit ethnic and sectarian divisions for their own purposes.\n\nBut from a policy perspective, it doesn't change the nature of the threat we're facing in Iraq. We're after a terrorist enemy, and that enemy is one that threatens not just Iraq, but our allies, our friends, and the stability of the entire region.\n\nAnd let me be clear, we will continue to work towards this objective, no matter the label we give it. I've always said that our presence in Iraq is a vital part of the global fight against terrorism. The terrorists know that if they can establish a safe haven in Iraq, they can make attacks on the United States, on Europe, and on other freedom-loving nations.\n\nSo, let me be blunt: our mission in Iraq is a critical front in the war on terror, whether it's characterized as an insurgency or not. And our unwavering commitment to the Iraqi people, to the Iraqi government, and to the global effort to terrify and disrupt terrorist networks, shall remain unwavering."

And I believe it's perfectly legitimate, in fact, I believe it's a necessary part of a healthy democracy for citizens to speak their minds and question the decisions of their government.\n\nNow, let me be clear about this: we are conducting a war of liberation, a war to free the Iraqi people from a brutal dictator who used chemical weapons on his own citizens, who threatened the stability of the region, and who had a history of supporting terrorism. Our troops are serving with honor and distinction, and I have every confidence in their leadership and their bravery.\n\n(leaning forward slightly)\n\nNow, to your question, it's not accurate to say that speaking out against the war is, by definition, undermining the troops. What is more undermining to the troops is when people question their dedication, their sacrifice, and their mission. I think it's essential to distinguish between constructive criticism of our foreign policy and outright rejection of our troops' commitment to serve this country.\n\n(pausing for emphasis)\n\nPresident Nixon, nearly 40 years ago, opposed the war in Vietnam, but he didn't undermine our troops' efforts. He had the courage to disagree with the war and still did not denigrate the men and women who were fighting on the ground.

But I also believe that our actions in Iraq have made the world a safer place. The removal of Saddam Hussein, who brutalized his own people and sought to acquire weapons of mass destruction, has opened up a region that was stagnant and led to the handing over of power to the Iraqi people. That's a significant achievement.\n\nIt's fair to say that we've made mistakes along the way, and I've always said that we'll learn from those mistakes. I take responsibility for those. But I strongly believe that our strategy, though imperfect, has led to positive developments in the Middle East.

You're right, historically, energy prices have fluctuated over time. And I'm not a fortune teller, but I can tell you that we're going to keep working to make America energy independent.\n\nAs you know, we've been taking steps to increase exploration and production of domestic oil and natural gas, and that's going to help our energy security. We'll also continue to support alternative energy sources like ethanol and other renewable fuels. But as far as predicting the future of oil prices, that's a tough one. We'll just have to wait and see.\n\nBut let me tell you, I'm committed to making sure that we're doing everything we can to stimulate economic growth and entrepreneurship, and that will help drive down prices in the long run. And I'm proud of the progress we've made in our energy policy."

The Polish people have been strong allies in this global war on terror, and we've seen their bravery in the face of terror in Afghanistan. Our Polish friends have been instrumental in the liberating efforts in Afghanistan, and their contributions to our coalition are vital.\n\nAs we move forward, I expect that Poland will continue to play a key role in our efforts to defeat terrorism. The next phase of operation is focused on stability and security in the region, and we're working closely with our Polish partners to ensure that region's stability. We'll continue to work with the Polish government and people to meet the needs of the Afghan people and to build a stable, peaceful, and democratic Afghanistan.\n\nAnd I'm pleased to say that Poland's military units have proven themselves to be among the finest in the international coalition. We appreciate their commitment to our shared goals, and we're grateful for their bravery and sacrifice. We'll continue to assess Poland's contributions based on their capabilities, and we believe they're well-positioned to continue to play a significant role in the region. Thank you for your question."

    "gen_response": "(speaking in a measured tone) Ah, thank you. The recent terrorist bombings you mentioned, including the ones in Morocco and Saudi Arabia, are a stark reminder of the ongoing threat from terrorist organizations. They certainly indicate that Al Qaida and its affiliates remain committed to their deadly goals.\n\nNow, as for whether we've overestimated the damage we dealt to Al Qaida, I wouldn't say that. I think we dealt significant blows to the organization, eliminating key leaders, dismantling its operations in Afghanistan, and weakening its ability to plan and execute large-scale attacks. However, as we've seen, terrorism is a patient enemy that adapts, and we must remain vigilant.\n\nThe recent attacks do suggest that Al Qaida is trying to regroup and revive itself, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. It's a clear indication that the fight against terrorism is far from over, and we must continue to work with our allies to disrupt and dismantle these networks.\n\nWe've made progress, but we must continue to stay focused on this threat, and we will continue to pursue the terrorists who seek to do us harm. We'll continue to work with our international partners to share intelligence, coordinate law enforcement efforts, and take actions to disrupt the financing and planning of terrorist activities.\n\nIn short, while we've made progress, the threat from terrorism remains, and we must remain vigilant and continue to take action to defeat the terrorists. Thank you."

    "gen_response": "That's a good question.  Let me answer it straight on. When it comes to the rapidly advancing nuclear-weapons program of North Korea, my administration is committed to a clear policy: we will not stand idly by while a country threatens the peace and security of the world.\n\nMy comments today, and those with our Secretary of State, make clear that an escalation of their program will have serious consequences. We've already made it clear what those consequences would be. However, the situation remains dynamic.\n\nIf North Korea chooses to do nothing, we will continue to watch closely and assess. We're working with our partners, the Japanese, the South Koreans, and our allies to make sure that we're all on the same page.\n\nEngaging in a military buildup or testing another nuclear warhead would be a dramatic escalation and cross a red line - that is something we would confront and certainly re-evaluate our options accordingly."

    "gen_response": "My fellow American, I appreciate your question. Let me tell you, we're aware of the concerns about the deficit, and we're taking action to address them. Now, I know there's been a lot of discussion about the decline in the dollar's value, and I want to assure the American people that we're working hard to get our economy growing, which will, in fact, help reduce the deficit over time.\n\nWe've got a comprehensive plan to get the economy back on track. It involves tax cuts, it involves deregulation, and it involves investing in key areas that create jobs and stimulate growth. We're also working to reform our tax code, which will help keep American business competitive.\n\nNow, I know the idea of relying solely on economic growth to solve the deficit might seem appealing, but I've said before, and I'll say it again: fiscal discipline and fiscal responsibility are essential to maintaining a strong and prosperous economy. We need to be smart about how we spend taxpayer dollars, and we will be.\n\nSo, in the short term, we'll be implementing budget reductions through regular order, and in the long term, we'll be looking at broader reform of our budget process to make sure we're not spending more than we take in. That's the American way, and that's the way we're gonna move forward."

And I know that not everyone agrees with those decisions, but I've made them with the best interest of America in mind.\n\nI would point to the fact that we've not had another major terrorist attack on our soil since 9/11. We've also ended the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, and we've made significant progress in Iraq in getting rid of Saddam Hussein's regime.\n\nOf course, I'm always looking for ways to improve my communication, and I appreciate the opportunity to have these kinds of exchanges with the press."

    "gen_response": "As I stand before you today, I want to acknowledge that while there have indeed been significant terrorist attacks in various parts of the world, we cannot measure the success of our efforts in the war on terror solely by body count. The difference is that before my Administration came into office, terrorist attacks were largely contained within a very specific region. The attacks that have taken place under my watch, while tragic, have been carried out by individuals and groups inspired by the same ideology as Al-Qaeda, but in different parts of the world.\n\nMake no mistake, we are making progress. We have dismantled terrorist networks, captured or killed key Al-Qaeda leaders, and brought unprecedented attention to the dangers of global jihad. My Administration's efforts to combat terrorism have led to the liberation of millions of people from tyranny and oppression.\n\nCritics may point to the numbers, but I challenge them to consider the circumstances surrounding these attacks. We are up against a determined and ruthless enemy. The perpetrators of these attacks often target innocent civilians, they use asymmetric tactics, and they have no regard for human life.\n\nOur focus is not just on the number of attacks, but on the nature and scope of the threat. We're working to disrupt the ideological underpinnings of terrorism, to cut off financing, and to build international alliances that share our commitment to defeating this threat. We're not defined by the actions of terrorists, but by our steadfast resolve to protect our nation and our values.\n\nThe war on terror is a marathon, not a sprint. It requires patience, perseverance, and a commitment to the values that have made America the greatest force for peace and freedom in the world. I understand the frustrations, but I urge you to consider the broader picture and the progress we've made. This war will not be won overnight, but with steady leadership, determination, and the support of the American people, we will succeed."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you.  The issue of education is a very important one, and we're committed to making sure every single child in this country has a chance to succeed. Now, I understand that some folks may be critical of No Child Left Behind, and we take that criticism seriously.\n\nAs it regards the lawsuit filed by the teachers' union, I'd say it's an opportunity for all of us to figure out how we can work together to make this program better. I believe we made a great start with No Child Left Behind, with the goal of ensuring that every child can read, write, and do basic math by the end of the third grade. But I also acknowledge that we can do better.\n\nAs for whether or not it's working, I honestly believe that No Child Left Behind is a step in the right direction. We're seeing significant gains in student achievement nationwide, especially in areas where they mattered most. I mean think about it - for the first time in history, we're seeing measurable results. We have to ensure that every teacher in America is equipped to teach these young minds the skills they need to succeed in life.\n\nHowever, I agree we have work to do. I've called for creating more flexibility within the program, and we're going to keep at it. I've also acknowledged the criticisms, made changes, and work with teachers, parents, and state leaders to fine-tune the program.\n\nEducation is a long-term proposition, not a one-year or even a four-year proposition. This is a huge challenge, and we're making progress.  But we'll keep working at it, militantly so, to make sure that every child in America gets the education they deserve. Along with that, I think we've got to be willing to measure if this thing's working."

    "gen_response": "Well, I appreciate the question. Ours is a courageous and bold agenda for the American people, and I'm committed to putting forward qualified individuals to serve on the federal bench. I think it's essential for us to get these nominees confirmed, and if that requires some hard work and applying a little bit of intensity to ensure that we get them through the process, then so be it.\n\nNow, I understand that there are critics out there who say that the Republicans treated some of President Clinton's nominees unfairly. And I think it's a fair observation. I mean, there were definitely instances where some Democrats used the filibuster unnecessarily, for example, by not allowing a simple up or down vote on the nomination of some of President Clinton's judicial nominees.\n\nBut let me tell you, our goal here is not to play games; it's to get the right people on the Supreme Court and in the federal judiciary. We're committed to upholding the principles of the Constitution, and we believe our nominees have the expertise and the commitment to get the job done.\n\nAnd as for stalling our domestic agenda, I don't think we'll be stalling so much. We've got a good spirit of cooperation, especially on the issues of education, tax cuts, and jobs. I am encouraging my nominee to become senators to put politics of trying to stall, aside, and get back to the real business of getting America back to work.\n\nBut look, I understand there are hard decisions that need to be made, and we're willing to do what it takes to get our nominees confirmed. We believe deeply in the importance of this fight for our country, and I'm willing to put in the effort necessary to make sure that happens.\n\nNow, while acknowledging that there may have been some slights of the past administrations to ours, we're going to rise above that, and we're going to lead, because that's what America expects from us."

As for the Federal Reserve, the Chairman position is a very important one, and it will indeed be filled through a proper process.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York will submit a shortlist of candidates to the President, following their established search and selection process. I'll then review that list and consult with leaders from both parties in Congress. It's my desire to find someone with a deep understanding of economics, a strong leader, and sound judgment. \n\nI will seek input from the Congressional leaders, particularly those on the Senate Banking Committee, so we can work together to find a consensus choice. We're looking for someone who will work in the best interests of the American people, with expertise in monetary policy and central banking. We'll then make an announcement when we've made our decision.\n\nAs for the timeline, we haven't set a specific deadline, but I would like to move forward in a timely manner."

    "gen_response": "Now, our commanders on the ground have made it clear to me that the death of Zarqawi is a significant blow to al-Qaeda in Iraq. His leadership was a major driving force behind the insurgency, and his departure will undoubtedly disrupt their planning and operations. They've also acknowledged that it may give us a short-term tactical advantage, as some of his followers may become hesitant or disenchanted, and may even turn on each other in the chaos that follows his death.\n\nAs for its impact on our strategy meetings here at Camp David, let me tell you, this development has indeed added a new dynamic to our discussions. We've been talking about the progress we've made in Iraq, and the challenges ahead, and the stroke of Zarqawi's leadership from the organization will be something that we'll be counting on to further weaken the insurgency.\n\nIn terms of specifics, our commanders believe that his death gives us a window of opportunity to take advantage of the existing divisions within the insurgency and push our counterterrorism efforts forward. We're also taking a close look at our intelligence to assess the situation on the ground and identify any potential vulnerabilities in the enemy's command structure. And of course, this change will pose new challenges as well, as the remaining leaders will attempt to regroup and reorganize in his absence.\n\nBut, we're confident that our men and women in uniform, as well as our coalition partners, are up to the task. We're going to take this momentum and drive it forward to achieve our objectives, and we'll be working closely with our allies to ensure a unified effort.\n\nI want to assure the American people that our mission in Iraq remains focused on three key goals: bringing stability to the country, building a secure and democratic government, and keeping the terrorists on the run. And I believe Zarqawi's death, in the long run, will help us move forward in all of those areas."

My experience has led me to believe that there are Democrats who are committed to a fair and deliberative process, and the majority of them are in fact supporting the mission in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nNow, as far as asserting control over foreign policy, I think what the American people want to see is a unified front in dealing with national security threats. That's why I've reached out to the Democrats on several occasions, and I hope we can work together to achieve that.\n\nBut, when it comes to authorizing the use of military force, as well as funding for our troops, I believe it's our duty to stand strong behind those in uniform and ensure that they have the resources they need to succeed."

And we believe our friends in your country could be a valuable partner in this effort. \n\nAs for cooperation on the use of joint sites, we're open to exploring our options. I think sharing the burden of defense and sharing the cost can be a powerful tool in promoting our friendship. I'm very mindful of the interests of our friends, of we have relationship in the region, and we want to make sure that whatever we do, we do in a way that enhances security for everybody.\n\nAs for trade and investment, I'm a proponent of free markets and open trade. I believe that trade is the engine of economic growth, and that's good for our people, it's good for your people, and it's good for the global economy.

And I've made 'em, no question about it. \n\nNow, in retrospect, I would say one of the biggest decisions that - that we, uh, that our administration made, was, you know, our approach to the situation with WMDs in Iraq. I strongly believed that Saddam Hussein was a threat to national security, and we had reason to believe that he had WMDs. But, in the end, we didn't find 'em. And, you know, that was a tough pill to swallow.\n\nNow, I still believe that Saddam was a - a threat. But, in retrospect, we probably - we probably should've done more to gather a broad international coalition. We should've been more careful in our statements about the weapons of mass destruction. We should've probably been more skeptical of the intelligence, rather than assumin' it was right, even though, at the time, we thought it was right. And so, that was a big mistake.\n\nBut, let me tell you, we also learned from it. We adjusted our policy, and we did some things right. We rebuilt Iraq, and we liberated a nation. And we made the right decision in takin' out Saddam Hussein. But, I gotta give you, in all honesty, I'm not proud of how we handled that situation.\n\nNow, I'm always lookin' for ways to improve, and I'm always learnin', and I'm always tryin' to do what's right.

We'll be taking a hard look at factors such as individual countries' stability, commitment to democratic principles, and their contributions to the alliance.\n\nWith regard to the Balkan States, they are an integral part of our efforts to promote stability and security in Eastern Europe.  We will be examining the progress of countries in the region, including those that have already made significant steps towards closer relations with NATO, such as  Albania and Croatia.\n\nHowever, before making any decisions on admission to the alliance, we need to ensure that any expansion is done responsibly and in the best interests of the organization and its member countries.

I believe the American people understand the threats we face, from terrorism to the proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, and I think they recognize the importance of investing in our military to protect our country and our interests.\n\nNow, I know that there will be disagreements and debates about priorities, and that's what the democratic process is all about. But I don't think it's naive to expect Congress to put our national security needs front and center. I've worked closely with members of Congress, and I've seen them put aside differences when it comes to national security.\n\nIn fact, I've been pleased with the way they've come together to support our efforts in the War on Terror, and I have no reason to believe they won't continue to do so. I've made it clear that our national defense is a top priority, and I believe that's where the majorities in both the House and the Senate agree.\n\nNow, I know there will be tough choices ahead, and we need to make sure we're using our resources wisely.

I'm asking them to be responsible, to make smart decisions about where our priorities lie, and I believe they will do that.\n\nSo, I'm not being naive; I'm being optimistic about what I believe the American people demand and what the members of Congress will deliver.

I've made it clear, and I want to reiterate it again today, that the United States will stand with the people of Ukraine in their desire for democracy and sovereignty. The democratic aspirations of the Ukrainian people must be respected, and any aggression towards them will not be tolerated.\n\nNow, I didn't take President Putin's statement today as a direct warning to the United States. But I do think his government's actions in recent days have been, shall we say, not in line with what I'd call honorable intentions towards the Ukrainian people.\n\nWe've made it clear that we believe Russia has a right to a Western border that's truly Western, but we also believe that the people of Ukraine deserve a say in their own destiny. So, we'll continue to work with our friends and allies in the region, NATO and the EU, to make sure that Ukraine's future is bright and secure, as it should be. We'll continue to stand firm against any intimidation or aggression from Moscow.\n\nIn my opinion, Mr. Putin's actions in Ukraine are a betrayal of Russia's own statements on democracy and sovereignty, which I've heard him speak about publicly on many occasions. So, this is a very complex situation, but we will continue to lead with strength and with our values at the heart of our foreign policy. Thank you."

Her comments on her visit to Egypt were intended to encourage the government's willingness to engage in dialogue with the opposition and to support the path of progress towards greater democracy.\n\nAs for whether or not our support for President Mubarak was premature, I think it's a bit simplistic to say that. We've made it clear for many years that freedom of assembly, freedom of expression, and the right to participate in free and fair elections are essential to any democratic society. President Mubarak has been a friend and ally of the United States and a critical partner in the Middle East, and we've worked with him to advance our shared interests.\n\nNow, regarding the events that followed the First Lady's visit, I am deeply disturbed by the violent crackdown on peaceful protesters in Egypt. We strongly condemn the use of force against civilians and urge the Egyptian government to respect the rights of its citizens. I would say to President Mubarak that we expect him to uphold the principles of democracy and to listen to the voices of his people. The path to stability and prosperity in Egypt is through greater freedom and greater democracy, and we will continue to encourage him to move in that direction.\n\nI believe that the first steps towards democracy are an important foundation, but they must be followed by steady progress in the direction of greater freedom and accountability. And to the Egyptian people, I want to reassure you that we will continue to support their aspirations for a free and just society. We will work with President Mubarak and the Egyptian government to ensure that the steps they take towards democracy are irreversible. Thank you."

The United States condemns the unfair and selective prosecution of Mr. Khodorkovsky. We believe that any crackdown on dissent or opposition to the government can undermine the Russian people's ability to express their views and participate in the democratic process.\n\nWhile I share your concern about the motivations behind this decision, I would like to emphasize that our primary goal is to foster a stronger relationship between the United States and Russia, a goal we've been working towards since the end of the Cold War. We've made considerable progress on issues like counter-terrorism, non-proliferation, and trade.\n\nHowever, the thoroughness with which the Russian government is executing Mr. Khodorkovsky's case, I believe, serves as an obstacle to further cooperation and underlines serious concerns that the Department of State has raised about the rule of law in Russia."

I'm committed to working with them to make sure that our next Justice will be a fair and impartial jurist who respects the rule of law and the Constitution.\n\nI don't think that agreement will directly affect our decision on the next Justice, but it's an encouraging sign that both sides are willing to work together on these important issues. We'll nominate someone who shares my judicial philosophy, and I'm confident the Senate will confirm them with a bipartisan vote. Thank you."

I appreciate your curiosity. \n\nLooking back on what happened in the aftermath of Katrina, I sure wish we had made some decisions faster, my administration responded quicker. One thing that we would've done is appoint a single point person within the federal government to coordinate the response efforts from the very beginning.\n\nWe had different cabinet members involved, different departments involved, but perhaps having one person, like the FEMA director, or someone like that, to be in charge, overseeing the whole operation would've streamlined our response, made it more cohesive.\n\nWe did what we thought was the right thing at the time, but in hindsight, a clearer chain of command would've been beneficial. And I also wish we would've responded more effectively to the pleas for help from those governors, especially Governor Blanco in Louisiana. We did the best we could with what we had at the time, but we can always learn from it."

We worked hard to select Harriet Miers, and I'm confident that she's a qualified individual to serve on the Supreme Court. Now, I understand that the process was a bit unconventional, and that's because Harriet and I have worked together for a while.\n\nI value her judgment, I value her integrity, and I value her commitment to the Constitution. And I'm proud to stand by her. As for releasing more documents, I'm willing to provide information to the Senate about her, but I'm not going to release confidential White House documents or staff communiques that aren't relevant to her qualifications.\n\nI think some of this concern has been fueled by the fact that we didn't accept the conventional path of releasing a lengthy paper trail of someone's past writings or statements before the nomination. But I think that's a reasonable approach in this case, since I didn't have the chance to work with many people who are lurking in the shadows in politics.\n\nI'm looking forward to the Senate hearing, and I'm confident that Harriet is going to do a fine job in answering their questions. I'm hopeful that we can have a productive and fair process."

I appreciate the question.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to emphasize that we're making great progress in the war on terror, against terror, and in Iraq. And as I look ahead to this time next year, I'm confident that we'll have made significant strides towards creating a stable and free Iraq.\n\nFirst, I'd like to highlight our efforts to establish a strong, representative government in Iraq. We're working closely with the Iraqi people, their leaders, and the international community to craft a constitution that will give the Iraqi people a sense of ownership and sovereignty. We're confident that this will be a major accomplishment by this time next year.\n\nSecondly, we'll continue to focus on economic development and infrastructure build-up in Iraq. We're committing significant resources to support the rebuilding of Iraq's economy, schools, hospitals, roads, and other critical infrastructure. This will demonstrate our commitment to helping the Iraqi people build a better future for themselves and their children.\n\nThirdly, and most importantly, we'll continue to hunt down and bring to justice those who seek to harm our nation and the innocent people of Iraq. We're making good progress in that effort, and we'll continue to take the fight to the enemy.\n\nRegarding troop levels, I can report that we're working towards a sustainable security environment, where Iraqi security forces are taking the lead in their own security affairs. We'll continually review the level of U.S. forces deployed in Iraq to ensure that we have the right number of troops to support this effort. \n\nIn the best-case scenario, we'd be down to a third \u2014 roughly \u2014 or less, of what we're at today, with the Iraqi security forces fully in control of their country."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you, folks.  I appreciate that question.\n\nFirst, let me say that I believe we've got a broken immigration system in this country, and we need to fix it. And to fix it, we need a comprehensive solution that addresses the whole issue, not just part of it. Now, a guest-worker program is an important part of that solution because it will help us create a clear system for those who are here working hard every day to earn a living, and also to ensure that haven't taken the place of American workers.\n\nNow, with regard to the veto threat, let me be clear: if the bill that comes to my desk doesn't include a guest-worker program, it'll be difficult for me to sign. I think it'd be a better approach to have a comprehensive bill that addresses border security, visa reform, and the current status of the undocumented aliens here. Now, as for the argument from some in the conservative community that a guest-worker program would be too liberal and hurt the Republican Party, I understand their concerns. I understand they're looking at their concerns about border security and deporting those who are here without authorization. My response to them is we can't afford to wait, we've got to get this issue done. The American people expect us to work together to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill. We need to be stretched with conviction, which I do, to do this in the interest of our country.\n\nWe're not turning our backs on those who are here working, both the guest-workers and the undocumented aliens who've been here a long time, we just need to do it in a way that the American people say fair, the American people say decent, and that protects the legal status of those who work in this country."

I respect 'em both, but abolishing FEMA? I don't think that's a good idea. We've had some tough learnin' experiences, no doubt about it. Katrina, in particular, was a tragedy, and it showed us we can always do better. But gettin' rid of an agency whose main purpose is to protect the American people from disasters? I don't think that's wise.\n\nWe've already implemented changes to improve FEMA's operations. I've called upon our states to assume more responsibility, workin' hand in hand with the federal government. And I've asked us to share new technology and ideas on how to better respond in disaster situations. \n\nFEMA will get a second chance 'longside of new ideas, new leadership, and greater cooperation at every level of government.

With regard to negotiations with Iran, I want to assure you that we are taking a consistent approach on the nuclear issue. We're working with the international community to see if we can find a solution that doesn't allow Iran to develop a nuclear capability.\n\nAs for the package of incentives, I think the European countries have put forward a meaningful proposal, and we're discussing it with them. But I must say, any agreement will have to be one that the Iranians can live with, but in the end, it still falls under earning back the trust of the international community. They have got a very significant burden to bear, showing that their intentions are good and they will adhere to any agreement, that's a tough burden.\n\n( Lean in )\n\nNow, as for what Iran stands to gain, it's clear they will gain international respect and cooperation on other issues of mutual importance like trade, security and non-proliferation. We've already seen positive steps towards cooperation on terrorism. However, using a nuclear weapon option is a power play that's just unacceptable.\n\nNow, with regard to those former foreign minister's proposal, I was briefed on them by our national security team. And let me be clear to you \u2013 while their kind words are sincere, we've got to measure what they do, not just what they say. Thus far, the Iranians have done little to prove their willingness to end their nuclear activities. We'll come to the table willing to work with them, but I think we've also got there with our eyes open."

We're making progress, and the strategy we put in place, it's starting to bear fruit. I understand that there are still some tough challenges facing the Iraqi people, and we're working closely with the new Iraqi government to address these challenges.\n\nAs for the public's opinion on troop withdrawals, I understand that there's another new poll out there today, that says most Americans think we should \"stay the course.\" So, I believe the majority of the American people are still solidly behind our mission in Iraq, as they have been from the very beginning. But I'm not just listening to polls; I'm listening to our military leaders, who tell me that our troops are making progress, and we should stay and finish the job.\n\nThat being said, we will continue to review, to adjust, and to get this job done. But we will do it with a careful, thoughtful, and deliberate approach, one that upholds the safety and the well-being of our troops, as well as the Iraqi people.

The Supreme Court's ruling, of course, is a significant development in our ongoing efforts to address the issue of greenhouse gas emissions. Now, I've always believed, and I continue to believe, that we must not elevate a rash, dramatic action from the federal government over the actions taken by the states. In fact, our approach, the Clear Skies initiative, has already led to significant reduction in emissions from coal-fired power plants. But the Sierra Club, for example, has stated they want more, they want immediate action. And in my mind, the only way that immediate action is going to happen is to elevate regulations nationwide, and then they will shut down those plants that can't comply, that won't invest in the new technologies.\n\nHowever, I do think this decision \u2013 by the way, it was not a regulation, it was a lawsuit filed \u2013 confines a finding on the authority under the Clean Air Act, I believe that strengthens my hand in working with Congress to achieve the same goals that the requirement of decreases in CO2 emissions, anywhere from 78 to 87 percent. These numbers are caught out there \u2014 this is what we need to meet the goals put forth by the Kyoto Protocol. So I think it certainly solidifies the case for supporting, the Clear Skies legislation and even something more comprehensive."

And I want to be clear: we're not targeting Russia with this system. We're targeting our enemies, those who would do us harm.\n\nWe've talked to the Russians at various levels, and I believe, in fact, that there's a basis for cooperation on this issue. I've spoken directly to President Putin about this, and we've had some very good discussions. We're willing to work with Russia to clarify the capabilities and limitations of the system, to provide transparency about the system, and to demonstrate that it's not a threat to Russia.\n\nAs for Chancellor Merkel, she's been a strong partner of ours, and I value her counsel on this issue. In fact, I spoke with her recently, and she's been helpful in trying to find a way forward on this issue. We're also working closely with NATO allies to make sure that we're all coordinated on this issue, and I'm confident that we can come to a understanding with Russia that works for everyone.\n\nNow, I know that there are some who would say, \"Bush, why are you pushing this issue so hard?\" My answer is simple: it's because I'm committed to protecting the American people, and I'm committed to defending our allies from the threat of ballistic missiles.

First of all, I'd like to say that Secretary Rice has made it clear that we're seeking a different outcome, a different path in the Middle East, a path that is more peaceful, more prosperous for the people of the region. And it's a path that's in the interest of the United States of America.\n\nIn terms of the expectations for this conference, I believe it's essential to make clear what success will look like. To me, success means a Middle East that's at peace, where Israel and the Palestinian people can live side by side in a thriving, two-state solution. It means that the Palestinian people can build their own state, with their own government, and their own economy.\n\nNow, in order to achieve this goal, significant progress is needed on key issues, such as borders, settlements, refugees, and security. And that's precisely what this conference is aiming to do. I expect at the end of this conference, we will have made tangible progress on these issues.\n\nNow, in terms of what we're offering to the Arab nations to encourage them to participate, I believe it's essential to be clear and direct about the role that Arab states can play in advancing a negotiated peace between Israelis and Palestinians. I believe that Arab nations have a critical role to play in helping to promote a peaceful resolution to this conflict.\n\nWe're offering a partnership, a partnership to help Arab states promote economic development, advance democratic values, and support innovative solutions to address regional challenges. This is a key aspect of the broader initiative I announced last week at the American University in Cairo. We believe that stability, prosperity, and peace are intertwined.\n\nWe're also offering a direct and sustained engagement with the Arab world, where we'll work with our partners to address common challenges, to consult on shared interests, and to build trust. We will demonstrate our commitment to a Dal dating vision of the Middle East, a region that is free from terror, free from fear, and at peace.\n\nNow, we've invited all parties to this conference, and I believe that by working together, we can achieve a brighter future for the people of the Middle East, a future that is more secure, more prosperous, and more just.\n\nBut let's be clear, success is not guaranteed. Compromise is required, and compromise requires a willingness to listen and to understand the legitimate interests of all parties involved. It's going to take time and effort, but we're committed to a successful outcome.\n\nThank you, and I'm now happy to take your questions."

And if those pledges fall short, we need to be prepared to take other actions.\n\nLet me be clear: we're not asking for a blank check. We're asking for a pledge of support that recognizes the challenges we face, and the necessary resources to meet those challenges. Our troops are putting their lives on the line every day, and we owe it to them to provide the support they need to succeed.\n\nI've spoken with Prime Minister Tony Blair and Chancellor Schroeder, and they share my commitment to seeing this mission through to its conclusion. I've also spoken with Prime Minister Martin of Canada, who's a strong supporter of our efforts.

It would allow them to work here legally, without giving them the opportunity to take permanent residency, which in the end, would distort our immigration system.\n\nJust like laws are in place to correct bad driving, we need to correct this situation in a compassionate, yet firm manner. A guestworker program would address the problem of the flow of illegal immigrants, and in doing so, demonstrate our society's values of fairness, justice and compassion.\n\nThe other key element is to ensure border security. One of the key reasons for a guestworker program is so that they can leave and reentry safely, and return to work when they can under our strict border control standards. But then of course, they come from countries with less severe economic conditions, which would provide fertile ground for pressure on our policy, our borders need to be secured first, so we can establish this balance in a productive immigration system."

    "gen_response": "Good afternoon, gentlemen. I'd like to remind you that the coalition we're building is a diplomatic coalition, not just a military coalition. We've made significant progress in recent weeks, and we're working closely with our allies around the world to make the case that Saddam Hussein's regime poses a serious threat to the world.\n\nWhile the turmoil in the Middle East presents its own set of challenges, it doesn't necessarily stand in the way of our efforts to build a coalition. In fact, the humanitarian crisis in the Middle East today underscores the urgency of our mission to dismantle Saddam's regime and bring about a more peaceful and stable future for the region.\n\nAs for Prime Minister Blair, he's a steadfast ally and a good friend. We've had many conversations about the need for action against Iraq, and I'm pleased to say that he's as committed to this effort as I am. We share a deep concern about the threat that Saddam poses, and I'm convinced that our nations will be better off when his regime is no longer in power.\n\nI'd like to remind you that our objective is not simply to secure a narrow, short-term objective, but to change the course of history for the people of Iraq and the broader region. We're working closely with our allies to build a coalition that will share the burdens and the risks of this effort, and we're making progress every day. I'm confident that we'll build a coalition that will be strong, that will be united, and that will be decisive in its response to the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's regime."

My responsibilities involved overseeing the company's accounting practices and ensuring that we were making good decisions. However, I was not the day-to-day person concerned with accounting details. \n\nAlso, it's worth noting that as the CEO of the audit committee, I did have access to financial reports, and there is evidence that major retrospect correspondence from an unusually aggressive petroleum analyst I got, had some concerns.\n\nNow, let me make this clear: I wasn't concerned with the stock prices, I bought and sold that stock as a long-time investors and the law allowed for the freeze trades."

The U.N. can help facilitate dialogue and collaboration on issues that require global action. I believe this institution can play a key role in the reconstruction of Iraq and promoting peace and stability throughout the region.\n\nAs for the debate over the U.N. in postwar Iraq, I'm confident we'll have the support of key nations. We'll have disagreements, yes, and we've already discussed this in various international forums. But we'll continue to engage in diplomacy, and as part of that process, we'll work with other nations, through the U.N. or however, to ensure that Iraq becomes a peaceful and stable country."

Let me start by saying that the search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq is an ongoing effort, and we're working very closely with our coalition partners and the Iraqi interim government to ensure that Iraq is rid of these terrible weapons.\n\nNow, I've been asked on several occasions about the lack of evidence of these weapons, and I want to say that the fact that we haven't found any yet doesn't necessarily mean they don't exist. We know they were there, and we know Saddam Hussein had them. And I'll tell you why: because he admitted to it. He came clean in December 2002, to the United Nations, and he said he had those weapons. And, in fact, we've got experts who've been working in Iraq, and they've identified various facilities and equipment that are consistent with what we would expect to see in a WMD program.\n\nNow, have we found any WMDs? Not yet, but I wouldn't say that the lack of evidence means they don't exist. I think it's a matter of time before we do find these weapons.\n\nNow, regarding the second part of your question, Vice President Cheney... (looks to the side) Ah, excuse me, Mr. Vice President.\n\n(Vice President Dick Cheney stands up)\n\nVice President Cheney: Mr. President, I'd be happy to address the second part of the question. And I think, unfortunately, there's still some disagreement between us and France and Germany on a number of issues, including Iraq and... the question of oil.\n\nMr. President, if I may have a word... (winks at the President)\n\nPresident Bush: (chuckles) Yes, please, Dick.\n\nVice President Cheney: (clears throat) While there have been differing views on the decision to remove Saddam Hussein from power, I think it's safe to say that we both agree that Iraq's energy resources \u2013 that is, its oil \u2013 are a major challenge and opportunity for the new government of Iraq. However, our priorities are focused on creating a stable and secure Iraq, and using the country's resources to benefit the Iraqi people and contributing to regional stability, not on exploiting those resources for any particular nation's gain.\n\n(clears throat) And I'd say that, as for our... disagreement with France and Germany, we still have some areas of difference, but I think we can work through those and find common ground on some of the key issues.\n\n(calmly) Thank you, Dick.\n\n(nods to Vice President Cheney)"

    "gen_response": "Well, thank you, thank you.  Several questions, a couple of different parts to that question. First, I'll tell you that the situation in both Afghanistan and Iraq is complex, it's dynamic, and it's going to take time. We've made a lot of progress in both countries, no question about that. But, the path to democracy, peace, and stability is a long one.\n\nThe difference, I think, between Afghanistan and Iraq is we were called to action in Afghanistan immediately following September 11th, because of the fact that Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda were harbored in Afghanistan, and we were able to unite the international community around a clear and briefed objective, to root out terrorists and remove the Taliban from power. And I'm proud to say we've had a good measure of success. Now, the Taliban still poses a threat, but we've driven them out of power, and we've established a sovereign government.\n\nIraq, on the other hand, was a long-term threat to the region and the world. Saddam Hussein's regime was a state sponsor of terrorism, it had weapons of mass destruction, and it was a destabilizing influence. That's why we worked with our allies to bring about our goal, that the people of Iraq can live in a free Iraq.\n\nNow the people of Afghanistan, the overwhelming majority of them are stoutly opposed to the Taliban. They understand the connection between the Taliban and al-Qaeda, and the threat that they pose to their way of life. I think the insurgency in Afghanistan is also a significant challenge, but it's different from the one in Iraq, because the Taliban's strength is what can be more accurately referred to as an insurgency driven by a foreign entity, while the insurgency in Iraq is more home-grown in nature."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you. Good question.  I agree with those in my party who are concerned about the deficit, and we have a responsibility to our fellow citizens to be fiscally responsible. You're right, reducing discretionary spending is just one part of the equation, and we need to take a comprehensive approach to addressing the deficit.\n\nOne area we're working on is tax reform. As many of you know, our economy has consistently created jobs and grown, and it's due in part to our pro-growth policies. However, we can improve the tax code to make it more efficient and help stimulate economic growth. We're looking at proposals to reduce the burden on small businesses and entrepreneurs, who are the backbone of this great American economy.\n\nAnother area we're focusing on is entitlement reform. Our Medicare program and the Social Security system are bedrock programs that need to be protected for future generations. But we have to be honest with the American people about the financial realities of these programs. We can't keep expanding these programs without control over the costs, so we're looking at proposals to slow the growth of Medicare and make sure Social Security remains solvent.\n\nFinally, we're committed to holding the line on domestic spending, which is where the growth of government is happening. We have to be judicious in our spending decisions, and we have to make sure that every dollar is spent wisely.\n\nNow, I understand that these are just a few ideas, and I'm not promising it's going to be easy. But I am committed to putting America's fiscal house in order, and I'm committed to working with Congress to do just that."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for the question. The war in Iraq, in my judgment, has had a profound impact on the broader region. The most significant accomplishment, in my view, is the removal of Saddam Hussein from power. This tyrant, who had committed, in my judgment, inhumane acts against his own people and those in the region, is no longer in power.\n\nThe removal of Saddam Hussein has given the Iraqi people an opportunity to build a democratic government, which in my view, will be a force for good in the region. It's giving them a chance to have a better life, and that's reflected in the ongoing growth of democracy in Iraq.\n\nNow, as for Mideast peace, I would say the war in Iraq has reflected the broader complexities of Middle Eastern politics. But, we've also seen significant progress. In my view, the signing of the road map in 2003 between the Israelis and the Palestinians marked a major step forward in the quest for peace. Though, I must say, it's a very tough process. Gaining the trust of the parties is difficult, but still, we will continue to work towards that goal."

    "gen_response": "Good afternoon, I'm glad to take your question. Let me be clear: the war on terror is a global conflict, and we must use every tool at our disposal to protect the American people.\n\nThe rendition program is a critical tool to disrupt and dismantle terrorist networks. Our government works with foreign governments to detain and interrogate terrorists who have been caught on the battlefield or in the course of criminal investigations. We do this to glean information about potential future attacks and to enforce the law.\n\nI understand concerns about the methods used in these interrogations, and we're working to ensure that they conform to U.S. law and do not put operations at risk. We will only do what's authorized by the law and adhere to the U.S. constitution and all international obligations.\n\nWhen it comes to another country detaining or rendering an American citizen, I think it's fair to say that our country has lodged objections to such practices in the past. If we believe an American is being held unfairly or without process, we'll do everything in our power to advocate on their behalf."

However, we must push the boundaries of our present law and make sure that it effectively serves our national security needs. Toward this aim, I have set up the National Security Interrogation and Detention panel to verify that anything we'll be doing is just and will indeed be based on principles that have long been the foundation of our justice system.\n\nOur strategy, as has been the case, will definitely protect American lives at the forefront, whether they be our soldiers or our citizens. Coerced statements, torture, that's not part of our new directive. We are quite direct on that point \u2013 anybody near that line at all will get fired immediately."

I was saying that I was looking for good in him, and I was giving him the benefit of the doubt. (pauses)\n\nAs for his recent statement, I would agree that it reflects the challenges that we're facing in our bilateral relationship with the Russians. We do have significant disagreements with the Russian government on a number of fronts, including missile defense, energy security, and the situation in the Caucasus. However, our commitment to our commitment to open, honest dialogue and negotiations remains strong.\n\nI still believe it's incumbent upon us to engage with the Russians on these issues, to try to find common ground where we can, while also standing up for American interests and values. So while I'd agree with the characterization of a deteriorating relationship, I'm not ready to give up the possibility of finding common ground.

As the President of the United States, I expect loyalty from my administration, but I also expect them to uphold the law and to be independent in their decision-making. It's a fine balance, and one that I think we've struck appropriately.\n\nHowever, let me make it clear: I was not involved in day-to-day decision-making when it came to those U.S. attorneys. I've said before, and I'll say it again, I told Alberto that I'd like to have more U.S. attorneys who'd been involved with the party more, but that was a suggestion, not an instruction.\n\nLoyalty, I believe, is important, but it's balanced with the Rule of Law, which I think is the most important aspect when it comes to the Justice Department and the U.S. attorneys that serve. They're there to enforce the law, not to carry out partisan agendas.\n\nNow, I'm proud of the fine people we've got working at the Justice Department, and I'm proud of the work they're doing."

We've got low unemployment rates, we've got a strong job market, and we're seeing continued growth in other sectors. And I'm confident that if we take the right steps, we can avoid a broader economic downturn.\n\nTo address the housing crisis, we're workin' with Congress to make it easier for people to get home loans. We're encouragein' more innovative financing options, like subprime lending, and we're tryin' to get more workers certified to help people get into foreclosed homes.

    "gen_response": "Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate the question, and I'll do my best to answer it. Let me tell you, we take the issue of democracy -- freedom, and human rights very seriously. We've spoken out against nations that deny their people's fundamental right to express themselves, to make their voices heard.\n\nNow, with regard to Pakistan, we have a complex situation on our hands. General Musharraf is a key ally in the War on Terror. We appreciate his commitment to rooting out al-Qaeda and the Taliban from Pakistani soil. We also appreciate his efforts in isolate militant groups within his own country.\n\nNow, I know there are some in the press and some in the opposition who would have me take a harder line against General Musharraf. But let me tell you, I've made it clear to him that the actions of the Pakistani government need to be consistent with our values. And when there are instances of mistreatment toward individual freedoms, we speak out.\n\nFor instance, we have concerns about the working of his government and his response to opposition politics -- the detention of Benazir Bhutto, for example. But I wouldn't call it a double standard. We're trying to balance the need to take on the terrorists with the need to promote democracy and human rights.\n\nWe're working with General Musharraf to ensure his government addresses those concerns, and we're going to continue to press the case because we believe that democracies are more stable, more peaceful, and more prosperous than authoritarian regimes. So, I think the key here is not to get mired in a debate over who is behaving badly, but rather to focus on what's in the best interest of the United States, what's in the best interest of peace, and what's in the best interest of people in the region.\n\nI hope that answers your question.

Look, we all know that the intelligence was wrong about the existence of WMD in Iraq, and for that, I take full responsibility. I mean, I'm not one to blame others for our mistakes, and as Commander-in-Chief, the buck stops with me.\n\nNow, let's get to the substance of the question. I don't think we're losing credibility just because we made an honest mistake. None of us have a 100% crystal ball when it comes to intelligence. We did what we thought was necessary at the time based on the information we had, and we rid the world of a tyrannical regime that had a history of using chemical and biological agents against its own people and neighbors.\n\nRegarding Iran, I'm glad to hear that their nuclear program has been halted. We'll continue to support the international community's efforts to ensure that Iran doesn't continue to pursue those technologies.\n\nBut let me make one thing clear: credibility isn't just about being right; it's about being willing to admit when we're wrong and adjusting course accordingly. We have, and we will continue to work with our international partners to address the threats that face us, and make the world a safer and more peaceful place.\n\nAnd one more thing, I appreciate your honesty in asking the question, that's what I respect about this press corps, we're not always agree on everything, but I appreciate that you can admit that maybe we, the United States, haven't been 100% accurate with everything we've said."

Look, initially there were concerns expressed about predatory lending practices \u2013 frankly, we did not act swiftly enough to address housing lending standards.\n\nWe implemented a plan to long-term reform \u2013 given to our legislative colleagues, must say that unfortunately our efforts were on hold for for this main legislative ambitions on the major legislation in 2005, the USA PATRIOT Act renewal, two separate bout amendment shifting at appropriation effort, all would've shown we honed Immigration Bill.

This is not just about Iraq, it's about the international community and making certain that the U.N. can fulfill its duties to the world to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nNow, I believe a second resolution is not about giving Iraq a veto power over the United Nations. It's about making certain that we have a clear understanding of what the international community expects from Saddam Hussein's regime, and that he has a clear understanding of what we will expect from him if he continues to deny and deceive the world about his weapons programs.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I believe that a second resolution is not only worth spending our time and energy to secure, but it is a critical component of our strategy to ensure that the regime of Saddam Hussein is held accountable for his actions.

As you know, during my administration, we've provided significant military assistance to the Philippines, and together we've made good progress in hunting down and killing key figures from the Abu Sayyaf and other terrorist groups.\n\nBut our relationship goes far beyond just our counter-terrorism cooperation. We work closely with the Philippines on elections, on democracy, and the promotion of human rights. We're also increasing our economic ties through free trade agreements and investment.

Over time, these personal relationships are what sustain us through the inevitable disagreements and policy differences that arise.\n\nNow, it's natural that we'll have, you know, some disagreements. We're all leaders of our respective countries, and our interests aren't always perfectly aligned. In those instances, we communicate candidly about those differences. We're direct, sometimes straightforward. We don't shy away from the debate. But we also know that beneath the strong relationships we've built, we can find common ground. And we can find agreement, despite our differences.\n\nIn my experience, that's how we've been able to build the trust among G-8 leaders, especially between the United States and our traditional allies. When President Putin was in, there were certainly disagreements on several issues, but I have to say, I think we built a strong bond based on our shared...concerns, if you will, on dealing with global terrorism.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the personal relationships we've forged at the G-8 have actually been really beneficial in navigating our disagreements.

We're working hard to build trust and confidence between Israelis and Palestinians through security cooperation, economic development, and on-going diplomatic efforts.\n\nWe're moving forward with the 'peace process' at a steady pace.  However, it is obvious that moving forward more rapidly than that would require more progress being made by both sides on several of these key issues.\n\nThe Israeli settlers are persons that we hold dear to us.  I see and believe that  To keep them on the map, we must make sure it's acceptable that such populations remain in this secured Israel so that another legitimate-genuinely representative and properly operating Israeli state takes off in this Gi'u-Lord\u0947\u0916onet fell insecure state."

The use of rendition to take captured terrorists and get them in a safe environment where we can get information out of them before they can harm more innocent people, I think is necessary. \n\nNow, I understand there are concerns about the way people have been treated in certain countries, and I take those concerns very seriously.  We have worked with foreign governments to make sure that they live up to our standards when it comes to interrogations. And where we've been forced to turn someone over to some country with, you know, different standards, we're very careful about it.\n\nBut let me tell you, rendition's not some covert program that's being run by the CIA.  It's a tool that's part of our effort to keep America safe, yes.  And to work with other countries that are also threatened by terrorist groups. We make sure that, you know, we abide by all applicable laws and, you know, rules."

My focus on Iraq has never wavered.  As a matter of fact, the strategy in Iraq is to secure the Iraqi people, to train the Iraqi military, to try to bring order to a place that's been ground zero for some of the most fanatical terrorist elements in the world.\n\nNow, the recent violence is not good news, of course.  But I do believe that the Iraqis are making progress.  They're making steady progress, mindful that the violence they're going through is a symptom of a society that's struggling to bring order.  And as I said, we ourselves have detected and disrupted a number of terror plots.\n\nAs for the Vice President's assessment, I value Dick's opinion, and I consult him regularly.  He's a wise counselor.  He's a man who's seen a lot of battle through his years in the Senate and the Vice Presidency.  And I respect his opinion.  But as for whether it is indeed in its last throes, I don't know.  I mean, we just can't know with absolute certainty.

Our primary goal is not to engage in negotiations with Iran, nor have we started any formal talks with them yet. However, we have reached out to the Iranian government through diplomatic channels regarding their activities in Iraq.\n\nOur objective is to convey to the Iranians that their support for insurgent groups in Iraq poses a threat to the stability of the region, as well as our own efforts to establish a stable democracy in Iraq. We expect the Iranian government to take steps to stop the supply of arms and explosives to these groups, which are responsible for the loss of countless innocent lives.\n\nRegarding the nuclear proliferation issue, we have long been concerned about Iran's nuclear ambitions. Our administration has made it clear that any nuclear-armed Iran poses a significant threat to regional stability and global security. We have worked closely with our allies and partners to pass UNSC Resolution 1737, which imposed sanctions on Iran for its nuclear activities. We will continue to work with the international community to address the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomatic means.\n\nIf necessary, we will not rule out taking further action, including working with other nations to impose more stringent sanctions on Iran's energy and financial sectors in order to bring them back to the negotiating table on the nuclear issue. But make no mistake, our primary goal remains the preservation of peace and stability in the region, and our approach will continue to be guided by a strong commitment to stand against terrorism and proliferation.\n\nAs you know, our administration has been very clear about our opposition to the spread of nuclear arms. We'll continue to work with the United Nations and other key players to resume diplomatic efforts that could prevent Iran's nuclear program from getting further along towards its nuclear ambitions."

This modification allows us to continue to work together to implement Resolution 1718, which was passed last month. The main reason for modifying the resolution was that we wanted to give North Korea time to comply with the requirements set forth in the resolution, particularly concerning its nuclear program.\n\nAs you know, the sanctions we were considering would have had significant economic implications for the North Korean people, which could have worsened their already dire situation. I don't think that would have been the right course of action. Our goal is to bring North Korea into compliance, not to cause harm to its citizens.\n\nWe do have other ways to pressure North Korea, and I believe that's the most effective route. We'll continue to work with our international partners to identify new ways to pressure Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear program, which poses a grave threat to regional stability and global security."

First, let me be clear: the United States stands firmly with Israel in its right to defend itself against terrorism. The fighting in the Middle East is a complex issue, and I understand that there may be disagreement among allies about what constitutes excessive force. However, as I've said before, our position is that Israel has the right to self-defense, and we must consider all the circumstances surrounding the conflict.\n\nPresident Putin and I have spoken about this issue numerous times. We agree that a two-state solution is the key to achieving lasting peace in the region. Russia and the United States each brings a perspective that can help facilitate a solution, and we're committed to working together to find an end to the violence.\n\nIn terms of what we can do, we're involved in intense diplomatic efforts through the Middle East Quartet, which includes the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations. We've called upon both parties to exercise restraint and to work towards a ceasefire, which can be the foundation upon which we can build a more lasting peace.\n\nFurthermore, we've increased pressure on Hamas to renounce violence and recognize Israel's right to exist. I have, on multiple occasions, spoken directly with leaders in the Arab world and told them that there's a responsibility to condemn and to fight extremism.\n\nUltimately, a lasting peace will require the sustained effort and commitment of all parties involved. I believe that with the right approach, with continued diplomatic pressure, and with a commitment to a two-state solution, we can mitigate the violence and move towards a more peaceful future for the people of the Middle East."

You see, folks, being the President of the United States is a big job, and I don't think it's like running for mayor or governor. It's a complex and demanding task. I think experience in government can certainly be helpful, but it's not the only thing that's important. I had very little experience, practically none, before I took office, and yet I was able to surround myself with some fine people, some of whom had experience, and together we were able to make some tough decisions. So, while experience is nice to have, it's not the only requirement for the office.\n\nRegarding a candidate's character, I think that's very important. I believe in what our founders laid out in the Constitution, that a President should be a man of strong character, with strong moral fiber. So, I think a man's values, his family, his faith - all these things are important to me when evaluating a potential candidate.\n\nNow, my own faith is no secret, and I believe it's a source of strength, not weakness. I've tried to bring a moral compass to my decision-making in the White House, to act in accordance with what I believe is right.

First and foremost, one of those steps must be his involvement in the ongoing efforts to investigate and bring to justice those responsible for the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. This includes allowing an international investigation to proceed with the full cooperation that they require.\n\nTo build on this effort, we also expect Syria to withdraw its armed forces from Lebanon, to abide by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559, which requires the disarmament, disbandment, and withdrawal of all foreign forces and militias from Lebanon.\n\nAnother key area is to take action to prevent the flow of terrorist groups from Syria to places like Iraq. We've seen clearly, the threat that terrorism poses across our great nation. We cannot continue to tolerate the idea that Syria would be harboring and sponsoring these terrorist organizations.\n\nAdditionally, we also expect the Syrian government to begin a comprehensive democratic reform process.

However, from the early stages of our administration, we were focused on understanding the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's regime.\n\nI understand Secretary O'Neill has spoken out on this matter.

As President, I had a duty to keep Americans safe, and my administration worked diligently to do just that. Now, I'm not saying we were perfect, and we did face challenges along the way.

But I truly believe if we don't address the problems in Social Security, we'll be ignoring our responsibility to our citizens. These personal accounts are all about giving individuals more control over their own assets, and allowing them to invest in a safe manner to ensure their future financial stability.\n\nI think our plan proposes two main options for personal accounts - one \"opt-out\" choice that would let workers further invest 1 or 2% percent of their payroll taxes in a personal retirement account, in addition to their Social Security benefits. These would be custodial accounts administered by a trust fund and would not be invested riskily, under a reasonable potential return - low risk.\n\nLet's put the needs of America's future first. Some say 'personal accounts are too radical' or 'they would end the Social Security program.' That's a false argument, and one I'll continue to address during the coming months.

I don't think there was any hesitancy on my part to choose strong conservative jurists. And as for the choice of Harriet Miers, I thought she was a fine lawyer with a reputation for integrity and a deep commitment to the Constitution.\n\nAs for charges of cronyism, let me say I don't think that's fair. The criticism of Harriet Miers was not based on merit, it was based on her characterization in the confirmation process. I chose her because I knew her and respected her, and I thought she had the intellectual ability to serve on the court. I was not immune to criticism, nor should I have been.\n\nNow, with all due respect, during an election, politicians often get evaluated on their choices. My nomination of Harriet Miers was one of those tough decisions. Of course, I've got regrets about some of the choices I made on my nominees, but the decision on John Roberts was a positive one.

We'll continue to honor their memory by staying the course and seeing this mission through to its end.\n\nNow, concerning whether we're winning or not, I say yes, we are making progress.

I'm interested in one that's got teeth, that has consequences for Iraq. \n\nWe've said all along, and I reiterate it again today, we're mindful of our strong relationship with China, but we're talking to them about a strong resolution that would disarm Iraq, not one that would poke holes in the disarmament effort.\n\nI do appreciate the flexibility of both France and Russia. We're working closely with the entire U.N. Security Council to see if there can be a strong, substantial resolution that carries the weight and reflects the commitment of the United States on its effort to disarm Iraq.\n\nSo, I just \u2013 you know, I believe we're going to continue to work together, continue to work towards \u2013  a goal we've set out, and that is a world more at peace."

As you know, Al Gore's loss in 2000 forced us to think long and hard about strategy, and, of course, our team's natural organizational structure after the fact lent a lot of thoughts to this question. \n\nNow, I want to say that I'm very happy with Dick Cheney as my Vice President. He's been a trusted partner, a dedicated public servant, a great friend, and, incredibly capable in the office he holds. His counsel and guidance have been invaluable, particularly during these trying times.\n\nAs for succession, let me say this: I'm committed to being re-elected for four years, not two. So, I don't think there's an urgent need to consider other options. Dick and I have worked well together, and I see no reason why we wouldn't continue on together in '04.\n\nWith that said, I do think that someone like Condi Rice would make an excellent President. But I think that's a long shot for the '04 cycle. Secretary Rice has been an outstanding Secretary of State, but more importantly, an exceptional person, if we needed to pivot after this election cycle.\n\nDick Cheney has, philosophically, been one of the most valued advisors I've had, from his work as an operative to his capability and policies post-elections. \n\nI can say this confidently: Dick Cheney will indeed be my running mate in 2004."

The assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri is a tragic event, and we have been working closely with the United Nations to get to the bottom of it. The evidence we have gathered so far suggests a strong link between the Syrian government and the assassinations of former Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri and other Lebanese politicians. We have made it clear to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that the United States expects the Syrian government to cooperate fully with the UN investigation, and to make significant changes in its behavior towards Lebanon.\n\nRegarding expelling Syria from Lebanon, the US is in agreement with the Lebanese people's desire to have a say in their own affairs, free from foreign interference. We're working with the Lebanese government, as well as with France, Germany, Japan, and others in the international community, to bring about a comprehensive withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon, which was referred to as United Nations Resolution 1559."

We've taken steps to improve security procedures and provide additional support for our troops in theater. The Pentagon has also been working with military commanders to enhance security measures at military bases and in more potentially vulnerable areas.\n\nWe've also increased the number of military advisers and non-military personnel providing humanitarian and developmental assistance to both the Iraqi government and the Iraqi people.

Their refusal to abide by IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] regulations and their failure to provide transparency about their nuclear program only adds to our concerns.\n\nAs for referral to the Security Council, we're working closely with our European allies to build a united front on this issue. We believe that the international community has a responsibility to act to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, and referral to the Security Council is a key step in that process.\n\nRegarding China, we understand that they have concerns about pressuring Iran, but we believe that our strategy is one of diplomacy and engagement, not coercion. We've been working with China on the Denuclearization of North Korea, and we're hopeful that they'll see the wisdom in a unified approach to this Iran issue. We're also reminding them of the threat that Iran's nuclear program poses to global security and stability, and that referral to the Security Council is in their own interests as well as the international community's.\n\nWe'll continue to work with China and other nations to build a strong coalition that recognizes the threat that Iran poses and is willing to take action to prevent further proliferation. We're optimistic that with continued diplomacy and communication, we can build a broad coalition in support of Security Council action.\n\nLet me be clear: our preference is for diplomacy, but all options are on the table.

I believe that a premature withdrawal from Iraq would embolden our enemies, destabilize the region, and undermine the gains we've made in security since coalition forces liberated the Iraqi people. \n\nHowever, I am open to working with Congress to address their concerns and to find common ground. I have directed my team to engage with Democrats to explore alternatives that would allow us to continue our mission in Iraq while also acknowledging the concerns of those who believe it's time to start transitioning our forces.\n\nOne idea that I've discussed with Republicans and Democrats alike is the concept of a \"conditions-based\" withdrawal, where our troop drawdown would be tied to specific milestones and the progress of the Iraqi government in taking responsibility for their own security. This approach would allow us to gradually adjust our troop levels based on the conditions on the ground, rather than adhering to an arbitrary timetable.\n\nI'm also willing to consider other measures, such as increasing the number of Provincial Reconstruction Teams, or PRTs, to help build the capacity of the Iraqi government and its security forces. And we're open to working with Congress to provide additional support for the troops and their families, as well as for the economic development and reconstruction of Iraq.\n\nNow, regarding your question about vetoing a second bill, I will continue to oppose any legislation that includes a fixed withdrawal timetable. But I'm a willing participant in the legislative process, and I believe that we can work together to pass a bill that reflects the best interests of our country and the security of our troops.\n\nWhile I haven't taken a final decision on whether I would veto a second bill, I'll tell you that whenever a bill crosses my desk that sets a concrete date for withdrawal, I'll have to weigh carefully the implications of that decision for our national security. My primary responsibility as Commander-in-Chief is to ensure the safety of our troops and the success of our mission in Iraq."

A half-point cut is a significant action, and it should help stimulate economic growth and provide relief to American families and businesses.\n\nHowever, I agree with the Fed that the situation is still uncertain, and we're not out of the woods yet. The recovery will undoubtedly face challenges, and we're prepared to take additional steps to support the economy if necessary.\n\nOne option being discussed is tax relief, particularly for middle-class families and small businesses.Reducing tax burdens on these key components of our society will help increase consumer spending and fuel economic growth.\n\nAnother area worth exploring is reforming our corporate governance practices. Too often, we see instances of corporate abuse and malfeasance that erode trust in our markets. Cleaning up these accountability issues will ultimately strengthen our economy and give investors confidence in the long-term prospects for American businesses.\n\nAnd of course, we'll continue to work closely with the Fed to ensure that monetary policy is aligned with our economic goals.

In fact, the U.N. estimates that we've allowed over $20 billion in humanitarian goods to enter Iraq, including food, medicine, and medical supplies.\n\nSecond, we've provided additional funding for food assistance to Iraqi children, including $3.7 billion in aid since 1997. Unfortunately, Saddam Hussein has consistently used much of these funds for his own military purposes and has refused to provide basic services to his people.\n\nThird, we've encouraged the U.N. to improve the administration of the sanctions, streamline procedures, and increase oversight to prevent abuse and corruption.\n\nIn terms of reconstituting the sanctions, I'll continue to work with the United Nations to modify them to balance our goals of pressing Saddam to disarm and improve the humanitarian situation on the ground. We can't ease the sanctions until Saddam Hussein takes tangible steps to comply with U.N. resolutions.\n\nOne idea that's been discussed is the concept of \"smart sanctions,\" which focus on strictly limiting Saddam's access to key materials and technology that can be used to develop WMDs, while still allowing humanitarian aid to flow into the country.\n\nUltimately, our goal is to bring Saddam Hussein to justice and bring about a more peaceful, prosperous future for the Iraqi people."

Let me just tell you, I've made it clear that we've been working closely with our allies and our friends in the international community to deal with the threat made by Saddam Hussein. The Vice President is doing an outstanding job of briefing foreign leaders and sharing with them the information that we have, and the danger that Saddam poses.\n\nNow, I've said that I'm committed to working with the United Nations and with our allies to address this threat. If we can find a way to address this through the United Nations, that's what we'll do.  But if we can't, I've also made it clear that we'll take whatever action is necessary to protect the American people and our friends. My decision would be based on the threat that Saddam poses, not based on whether or not we can get U.N. approval.\n\nWe all know that sometimes the United Nations can provide some international legitimacy to action, but it shouldn't hinder us from doing what we have to do to protect America and its interests. So, I'll make that decision based on what I believe is necessary, not on whether or not we get approval from the international community."

    "gen_response": "I'd like to clarify a few points about Chairman Arafat. While I have expressed disappointment with some of the decisions made by Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority, I still believe that the Palestinian people deserve a sovereign state of their own, living side-by-side with the state of Israel in peace and security.\n\nWith regards to affiliations, I would say that Chairman Arafat is a member of the Palestinian leadership. As for whether the world would be a better place without him, that's a difficult question. Perhaps a more productive way to frame it is that I've made it clear that the United States will not negotiate with terrorists or syntax support groups and leaders who fail to renounce acts of terrorism and terrorism funding.\n\nHowever, what I do think, is that the leadership vacuum following Chairman Arafat could have a profound impact on the Israelis and the Middle East Peace Process, further driving terror or further peace. This would offer an opportunity to support a more moderate Palestinian leadership, one that is genuinely committed to peace and coexistence with Israel, rather than true Palestinian statehood one where Palestinians are merely subservient to a two-state solution without a state."

It shows the willingness on the part of the Israeli government to work towards peace, to live side by side with the Palestinian people.\n\nThis is a major development, and I applaud the leadership of Prime Minister Sharon in making this decision. We believe it's in the best interests of Israel, it's in the best interests of the Palestinian people, and it's in the best interests of the Middle East region.\n\nAs for moving forward, we will continue to work with our interagency team, with the Quartet - the U.S., the EU, the UN, and Russia - to encourage the implementation of the roadmap. We'll be working with Prime Minister Sharon and Palestinian Authority Chairman Abbas to make sure that the security plan, economic plan, and political plan are implemented as agreed upon.\n\nRegarding the next steps, we will be in close consultation with both Prime Minister Sharon and Chairman Abbas, and we're looking at a number of options for future meetings. I don't have a specific destination in mind at this time, but I can tell you that we're looking at the Middle East as a region where we can make progress on the peace process.\n\nI do want to emphasize that a peaceful solution to this conflict is not only in the best interests of Israel and the Palestinian people, but it's in the best interests of the wider region. And we're committed to working towards that goal. Thank you."

It's unacceptable for North Korea to go down this path, to pursue more nuclear capabilities. We've seen the devastation that can be caused by nuclear proliferation, and we won't stand idly by.\n\nLet me be clear: the United States will continue to work with our international partners to pressure the North Korean regime to abandon its pursuit of nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities. We have made it clear that any further attempts to develop nuclear weapons will face isolation, economic hardship, and further pressure from the international community.\n\nNow, on the diplomatic side, we continue to engage with China, as we have made it clear to the North Koreans that they cannot be legitimized unless they comply with their obligations, including the complete and verifiable dismantlement of their nuclear program.\n\nI believe that the Chinese can help on this; in fact, I've been in communication with President Hu Jintao about the need for China to use its influence with the North Koreans to ensure they don't go forward with these nefarious activities. I'm hopeful that these diplomatic efforts can bear fruit, but we'll not be deterred in our resolve to make certain that North Korea understands the dangers of what they're pursuing.\n\nLet's be clear: we're at a critical juncture here. The world -- the international community -- must stand together to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to states and non-state actors, and to deny these countries any sort of privilege or respectability. We have made it clear that any North Korean plans to acquire nuclear bombs will have serious repercussions, and we will not do it at the expense of our partnership with China. That's why it's, we're working close with China, with other nations -- we're making tremendous progress in other areas, regardless of these crisis."

We both believe that in times of crisis, the President and the Secretary of Defense have got to be flexible and have the ability to use the right tools to get the job done. Now, NATO is a vital and important alliance,  No need to make any bones about that. But, in the case of this global war on terror, we're dealin' with a new kind of enemy. A non-state actor, that threatens not just America, but the freedom and security of many countries around the world. (pauses) And we can't be locked into any one particular way of doin' business.\n\nWhen I say that the mission determines the coalition, I mean that we're goin' to bring together the people, the nations, and the resources that are willing to fight and win this war. Now, NATO's got a history of callin' forces together when they're called upon. But, yet, after 9/11, we also called upon other allies, like Australia and South Korea, to help us in this global war on terror. We've partnered with Poland in the war in Afghanistan. So, NATO's an important part of this coalition, but it's not the only part. (pauses) It's all about bein' adaptable, and buildin' a coalition that'll get the job done.\n\nNow, there's a school of thought that says we gotta do it this way, or that way.

Now, regarding your question, the decision to deploy American forces into any given conflict is not made lightly.\n\nOur primary goal from the onset of the operation was to liberate the Iraqi people and bring stability to that country, which has been under the yoke of tyranny for far too long. We've made clear to the world that the use of force would be necessary to disarm Saddam Hussein's regime and to bring freedom to the people of Iraq.\n\nRegarding the prospect of civil war, we're working closely with the Iraqi people and their leadership to ensure they have the capability to maintain security and stability in their new democracy. The training and equipping of Iraqi security forces, both military and civilian, is a top priority.\n\nWhile we cannot predict with certainty the future, it's our hope that the Iraqis will be able to govern themselves and resolve their differences peacefully. Military action should ever be the last resort, but we are prepared to do what it takes to prevent humanitarian catastrophes from occurring.\n\nIt is our expectation that the Iraqi people will have the capacity and will be able to deal with any internal conflict that should arise, the United States will remain a committed partner in their struggle for peace and stability."

    "gen_response": "Well, the comparison between our military's capabilities and the Iraqi military's capabilities is an important one. However, I believe it's a bit of an apples to oranges comparison. The nature of the enemy we're dealing with in Iraq is different from what we're accustomed to. We're dealing with an insurgency, a guerrilla war, that's using terrorist tactics, ambushes, IEDs, roadside bombs, and other asymmetrical warfare strategies. \n\nThat's a different kind of enemy than we faced in Kosovo, or Afghanistan, or even during Desert Storm, where we had a more traditional military opposed to us.\n\nBut we're confident in the Iraqi military's advancement. They've made significant progress. The comparison to ours is unfair because we have a military force that's far more technology-driven, better-equipped, and numerically larger, whereas the Iraqi military is a paramilitary force in the making, still getting their footing.\n\nIt's similar, in some ways, to how we built our military after World War II. We built up our military from the ground up, after years of relative peace. It's the same thing in Iraq. It's a question of developing an institution, giving them the resources, the training, and the ability to lead, to begin to think for themselves, and to become self-sufficient in their own defense.\n\nWe're making progress, and indeed, as you noted, the violence in some areas is subsiding. It's a slow-moving conflict, and it has its ebbs and flows. But I'm confident that with the help of our coalition partners, with the capability and strategy we're putting in place, we'll get the job done.\n\nWe're going to be successful in Iraq."

The families of those Illinois National Guardsmen, like the families of many Guardsmen from all across this great nation, can rest assured that we are committed to supporting our troops in combat. We're slowly beginning to bring our troops home from Iraq, but the security situation in Iraq remains challenging, and we need to have sufficient troops on the ground to ensure that the transfer of security responsibilities to Iraqi forces is as smooth as possible.\n\nWhile it is our intent to drawdown our troops over time, that process will have to be based on the advice of our commanders on the ground, and on the capability of the Iraqi security forces to stand on their own. So, while we can't give a specific timeline, we can assure the families of those Illinois National Guardsmen that their loved ones are making a vital contribution to the security and stability of Iraq, and we'll continue to do everything in our power to support them and to bring them home safely.\n\nWe're grateful for their service, and we're grateful for the sacrifices they and their families are making. We'll continue to do everything in our power to ensure that our troops, whether active duty or National Guard, have the resources, the support, and the care that they need to complete their mission and to come home to their families as soon as it's safe to do so.

Let me start by saying that my meeting with Prime Minister Maliki was productive, and we had a good discussion about the situation in Iraq. We share a common goal: to create a stable, free, and democratic Iraq.\n\nNow, with regards to your question about additional troops, I wouldn't say that we agreed on sending more U.S. troops. What we did agree on was our shared concern about the high levels of violence in certain parts of Iraq, particularly in places like Baghdad and al-Anbar Province. \n\nThe Prime Minister and I discussed a range of options to address these security concerns. We talked about increasing the capacity of the Iraqi security forces, improving intelligence sharing, and enhancing our training and support for their fighter units.\n\nRegarding the specific question of additional U.S. troops, I want to be clear that our policy in Iraq is focused on ensuring the Iraqis succeed without us dictating how they do it. They need to take ownership of their security, and we're committed to helping them in any way we can. We'll continue to review our strategy, work closely with the Iraqi government, and adjust our approach as needed to ensure the security and stability of Iraq.\n\nSo while we haven't agreed on a specific plan to send more troops, we're committed to working together to achieve our shared goals in Iraq. And that's what I'm optimistic about \u2013 that we're making progress, but we've got a long way to go.\n\nNext question?"

I'm glad to have the opportunity to address this important issue.\n\nWe are seeking a multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo, living side by side in peace. The Ahtisaari plan is designed to do just that, and we're working closely with other international partners to get the formula right. As you know, after 78 days of violence, NATO intervened to push back the Yugoslav military, and now we're working to instill stability and a framework for the future.\n\nTo move forward, we're escalating our efforts to encourage the parties to accept the plan. We're encouraging the Monitoring Mission to do the same and to verify that the parties are working towards a peaceful and independent Kosovo. We're also encouraging our partners to bring relief to the refugees and displaced people.\n\nAs your question was well framed - there's a point where we would have to reassess our strategy, and that would be if the parties aren't responding to the incentives and arguments presented to them. In particular, Slobodan Milosevic and the Yugoslav leadership would have to be proven willing to take real steps towards implementing the Ahtisaari plan, including transferring authority to the new provinces. \n\nIf after a reasonable period of time, which I'd say would be around six to eight weeks, the Yugoslavian folks haven't gotten their act together, then we will\u2013 will re-evaluate the whole strategy and we'll do more based on the circumstances that exist, we'll take more decisive action as a president."

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a vital role in the secondary mortgage market. However, I do believe they need to be reformed.\n\nThe GSEs, or government-sponsored enterprises, are exempt from state taxes and have a blank check at the Federal Reserve, which can be problematic. That's why we've asked Rep. Frank of the House Banking Committee and Rep. Baker of the House Financial Services Committee to work on bipartisan legislation to reform them.\n\nThe current crisis shows us that we need to get back to sound lending practices, and we need to make sure that our mortgage buyers, Fannie and Freddie, are solvent. And we're also working with the Federal Reserve to see if there are other options available for them. But for now, no, I do not believe that we should let them buy those subprime mortgages."

General Petraeus is a decorated war hero, a man of honor, integrity, and character.

And the President's decision to meet, in this case the President-elect of Taiwan, is not a change in that policy. It's a reaffirmation of what we've said for many years.\n\nI understand the Chinese government has expressed some concern, but I also understand, that we have the right to meet with anyone who wants to talk to us. We have a history of meeting with leaders of all denuclearized countries, in fact all countries.

We need the help of China to deal with some very serious matters, Iran and North Korea being two of them. But, it's also important for us to stand by our principles. And in this case, our principles are the sovereignty of the people and the right to make our own decisions.\n\nI'm confident that our relationship with China is strong.

A strong dollar, you see, acts as a magnet for foreign investment, and it makes our exports more competitive in the global marketplace. Now, I know that some of the experts might tell you that a strong dollar is not always a good thing, but I disagree.\n\nWhen our dollar is strong, it means that American goods and services, whether it's automobiles or high-tech products, become more attractive to foreign buyers. And when foreign buyers are eager to purchase our goods, it creates jobs here in America, and it bolsters our economy.\n\nNow, I know the Federal Reserve has a responsibility to manage monetary policy to keep our economy growin', but I believe it's essential that we also recognize the importance of a competitive dollar in our overall economic strategy. We need to make sure that we're sendin' the right signals to the world, that we're gonna let the free market forces work their magic, and that we're gonna make sure that American businesses have a competitive environment to thrive.\n\nAnd let me tell you, the American people get it. They understand that a strong dollar is a strong dollar, and when our dollar is strong, it's a reflection of their hard work and their enterprise. So, I'm committed to makin' sure that we keep our economy growin', keep our dollar strong, and keep America competitive in the global market. Thank you."

I'm glad you brought up the issue of national security, a matter that concerns us all. \n\nFirstly, regarding polygraph tests for senior FBI officials, I find it prudent to exercise caution in applying such measures. While I understand the interest in ensuring the integrity of our national security agencies, using the polygraph as a universal tool for testing senior officials may not be the most effective approach. However, I am willing to consider it on a case-by-case basis, where evidence points to specific individuals who have compromised national security.\n\nNow, regarding the responsibility of Director Louis Freeh, I need to emphasize that Director Freeh has been a key ally in our efforts to combat terrorism and strengthen our national security. However, the recent breach may raise questions about oversight and accountability within the Department of Justice. \n\nIn order to ensure that we learn from this incident and prevent future breaches, I believe it's essential to conduct a thorough investigation of the entire incident, focusing on whether any systemic failures or individual mistakes contributed to the breach of classified information. Director Freeh has assured me that he is cooperating fully with this investigation, and we will wait for the outcome before determining whether he and any other officials bear responsibility for this incident.\n\nWe will work to address the breakdowns that led to this lapse, and we'll take action to safeguard against future compromises of our national security.

    "gen_response": "Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate your interest in our nation's energy policy. The energy situation is a serious concern for the American people, and I share that concern. While I'm optimistic about the progress we're making in diversifying our energy sources, we still rely on foreign oil to meet a significant portion of our needs.\n\nRegarding Saudi Arabia, let me tell you, I've had personal relationships and frank discussions with the King and his team. Our conversations have centered on our mutual goal of increasing oil production, but the decisions on that are ultimately up to them.\n\nWe cannot and should not use coercion or threats to compel other nations to act a certain way. That's not how international relations are best conducted. What I can say is that we've established close relations with our friends in Nigeria, Mexico, and Canada, and we're working with them to explore ways to increase production and stability in the global energy market.\n\nIn fact, Nigeria has shown progress in ramping up production, and Mexico is also making strides in increasing its oil output. Our relationship with Canada is robust, and we're moving forward on initiatives like the Mackenzie Gas Project and the integrated gas pricing policy. These are crucial steps towards meeting our energy needs.\n\nWith Saudi Arabia, I will continue to maintain dialogue and keep the lines of communication open. They have our respect and appreciation for their vast oil resources. I want to be hopeful that they will continue to work with us to find solutions to our energy challenges, but ultimately, it's up to the Saudi government to make decisions that benefit their nation.\n\nAnd I want to remind the American people that we're taking bold steps to address our energy crisis: the Energy Bill that passed in Congress last year, the development of new technologies, investments in renewable energy sources \u2013 all of which will reduce our reliance on foreign oil in the long run."

The zero tolerance policy I've spoken of refers to our policy towards any future Iraqi non-cooperation with the United Nations, particularly with the special inspections in relation to WMDs. We'll confront if there's any refusal to comply, and it won't be tolerated.\n\nAs for Don Rumsfeld, he's speaking about the expectations we've got as we evaluate the behavior of the Iraqi government. He's saying, and I agree with him, that any behavior which is indicative of a refusal to comply with our requests, and also the requests by the UN, will most likely hint at a much larger pattern of non-compliance.\n\nSo for us, the zero-tolerance policy has to do with the actions of the current regime in violation of future weapons inspections. Secretary Rumsfeld is talking about expectations we've got towards this Iraqi regime's behavior and its implications of future compliance.\n\nIt's not an either-or situation here. Both our approaches reflect the determination we have to address this threat, while also understanding that we've got to give the inspectors a chance to do their job. And I truly believe these inspections are still a vital part of our efforts to find out if the Iraqi regime possesses a WMD program."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for that question. The issue you're referring to, I take it you're talking about places like Kosovo or perhaps other parts of the world where governments are dealing with conflicts and uncertain futures, uncertain stability.\n\nLook, the United States of America has always believed in the founding documents of democracy: liberty, freedom, individual rights and self-governance. We've learned throughout history that democratic institutions are a better way of life, even though they're imperfect.\n\nWe support democracy, and we support strengthening democratic institutions when appropriate, but this doesn't necessarily mean that the United States always sends troops onto the ground. You know, I think sometimes people might misunderstand our \u2013 our missions and our intentions.\n\nWhen we send our troops anywhere, it's to protect our interests first, and our interests include the security of the American people, which means a safer world. We also seek to put in place more stable governments that are accountable to their people.\n\nNow, the specific question about separatist regions. This gets to a very complicated issue. In a democratic society, I believe in the rights of self-determination and the recognition of minority rights. But here's the thing: whether we support an independent region or not, must be balanced by the need to avoid exacerbating further conflict, maintaining regional stability, and for the region's viability, its immediate neighbors and beyond. \n\nThe Kosovo question, for example: We supported the decision to intervene in Kosovo because of the high level of humanitarian crisis, primarily ethnic cleansing. So it was a different scenario there. But generally speaking, U.S. government officials and policymakers, when considering whether separatist regions should be independent or not, we look at a variety of factors.\n\nWe're going to consider whether an independent region could maintain international boundaries and borders without potential destabilization of its immediate neighbors and the overall region. We also have to consider whether the demand for an independent region is based on an irreversible choice by people who wish to be free from another government. And finally, we have to look at it from the stance of how independent can the region really be and would it affect regional stability at large?\n\nIt's a big challenge. Intervening and not intervening, or agreeing to let people go or not \u2013 it's something we look at very hard before we make any decisions."

Now, the questions about Guantanamo - I have tremendous respect for Chancellor Merkel, and I appreciate her concerns, and those of many other world leaders, about Guantanamo.\n\nThe concerns are threefold: The first is the status of the detainees, the second is the perception of the U.S. around the world, and the third is the role of Guantanamo in our gathering intelligence information.\n\nOn the first point, we have made a promise to the families of the victims of September 11, the people of New York and Washington, and to the American people that we will continue to hold these individuals who pose a threat to America and its allies until they are brought to justice. We have developed a comprehensive system for evaluating these detainees and will apply the Geneva Conventions as we determine the appropriate disposition of those detainees.\n\nOn the second point, I understand that Guantanamo has become a lightning rod and I acknowledge that some people around the world perceive it negatively. However, I believe that we can close Guantanamo while still fulfilling our promises to America, to our allies, and to the world. The question is how.\n\nAs to what I plan to do, the 116 recommendations of the 9/11 commission reports said there would be detention centers, but it didn't specify where.  I also want to leave the option open, for Congress to pass legislation that would provide the necessary legislation for its continued operation, or for alternatives that would give us the tools we need to ensure that these individuals are safely held in facilities that meet our requirements.\n\nLet me conclude, I want to say that while I appreciate Chancellor Merkel's concerns, the U.S will work toward resolving this situation, and we are looking to speed up the process of agreement from the Congress on the newly submitted legislation with Mr. Santorum, Senator Lindsey Graham and others."

And I believ that this plan is not about abandoning the two-state solution, but rather, it's about finding a way to move towards it.\n\nThe plan we're talking about, the West Bank plan, is a, a way to, uh, create a framework for final status talks to begin, to give the parties, particularly the Israelis and the Palestinians, a clearer understanding of what's on the table, a clearer understanding of what the stakes are. And if, uh, both sides have objections to certain areas of the plan, we're willing to listen, but we're also willing to say, you know, let's get on with the final status talks.\n\nAnd I tell you, I still believe that the, uh, potential for a two-state solution is there.

I think my comments may have been a little misinterpreted, folks. I was trying to draw attention to the fact that Zarqawi was a lieutenant of Saddam Hussein, but not directly in contact with him at the time of his death. \n\nNow, as we reflect on Zarqawi, we should be under no illusion about the threat he posed. He was a vicious individual, responsible for the slaughter of women and children, an extremist who sought to destroy everything that we hold dear. His death is a significant victory for the Iraqis and for the coalition.\n\nThat being said, I believe we should be cautious in our expectations as we take him out. Whether it's Zarqawi, Saddam, or any other high-value target, there are going to be others who come in behind them, folks. The fight is not just about capturing or killing one person. We have to be committed to completing the mission in Iraq and ensuring that success in that theatre.\n\nI think that's why I was being cautious in my comments earlier today.

We have made significant progress, and yet, the challenges remain.\n\nFirst, we have put in place a comprehensive and robust missile defense system to protect American soil and our allies from the threat of a North Korean missile attack. Our military has also taken steps to bolster its presence in the region, including deployments of troops to South Korea and the installation of advanced missile defense systems.\n\nWe've also made efforts to increase pressure on the Kim regime, through economic sanctions, which have resulted in significant cooperation from other nations. These sanctions have choked off revenue streams for the North Korean regime, making it more difficult for them to pursue their ballistic missile and nuclear programs.\n\nHowever, as you acknowledged, the process has not been effective in changing the regime's behavior. We continue to employ this approach because it remains our most effective means of addressing the threat from North Korea. The international community has spoken with one voice on this issue, and these economic sanctions are a crucial part of our collective effort to change the calculus in Pyongyang.\n\nThere's also been recent breakdowns in communication with North Korea, but the problem has not disappeared. We've not given up hope for a diplomatic resolution, but we will not let our guard down. We will continue to apply pressure, and as new opportunities arise, we will engage in direct talks with North Korea.\n\nIt's also worth noting that progress on the nuclear issue is unfortunately inextricably linked to the human rights situation in North Korea. While we're not recognizing the regime's legitimacy until they take steps towards more acceptable behavior, we encourage them to open up their country and let their people livefree. The Six-Party Talks have held promise, but we need North Korea to demonstrate that they're willing to honor their commitments and carry out the necessary actions to ensure the region is stable and secure.\n\nUltimately, the United States remains committed to preventing and thwarting North Korea's nuclear ambitions."

The situation on the ground is a concern to us, that's for sure. As you know, I supported NATO's decision to go into Kosovo in 1999 to stop the atrocities being committed by the Serb forces there. Since then, Kosovo has been a province under UN administration.\n\nSecretary Rice, our top diplomat, has spoken with European leaders and they're working on a resolution to this, and we're also consulting with the UN. But we're talking about a situation that will call for the parties to work towards the protection of minority rights, and we're gonna weigh in carefully on any decisions. We're not at a point yet to comment on a specific timetable for a declaration of independence.\n\nPrior to any decision, we are thinking about the same people who are saying \" if Yugo breaks up, who gets what\" and certainly, the Kosovar Albanians are an integral part of the region. On this issue an affirmative answer to your question will need to be based on a rational comprehensive resolution of the conflict.\n\nNow, regarding the African Union peacekeepers, and the situation in Darfur, it's critical to note that the AU has taken a leadership role, demonstrated its commitment, and shouldered the burden of peacekeeping in this area. President [Obasanjo] of the African Union, he and I have had discussions on this, and we agree that the AU has both the will and the capacity to tackle the violence in Darfur.\n\nI'm eager to see the Transitional Federal Government provide more troops and reinforce the African Union Mission in Sudan. Secretary Rice is working to mobilize international resources and Danielle Kurtz-Phelan Negroponte who is involved especially on Resolution 1706 Ethiopia will carry his work forward with the adoption of that Resolution."

We've made it clear to North Korea that nuclear weapons development is unacceptable. It would mean that they're violating international law, violating the agreements they've made to denuclearize. \n\nWe will continue to engage in diplomatic efforts with our allies, including our friends in Japan and South Korea, and we'll continue to pressure North Korea to comply with U.N. Sanctions and their commitments under the framework. Make no mistake, the United States is committed to denying North Korea a nuclear capability, period.\n\nNow I will tell you, in the past, we have seen them make a decision to withdraw from the Agreed Framework, and then rejoin. What we cannot do is to give credence to this notion of \"direct talks\" with North Korea outside the framework of the six-party talks. The six-party talks give us leverage to bring North Korea back to the table and keep them accountable for their commitments.\n\nMake no question we'll continue to pursue a policy aimed to disable and verifiably and irreversibly dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons program. We're steadfastly committed to working with the world community to achieve that goal.

The reality is that the insurgency in Iraq is a complex and adaptive enemy. They're a mixture of pre-war Ba'athist holdouts, foreign fighters, and terrorist groups with extremist ideologies. They're trying to use our presence to fuel their own radicalization and recruitment efforts.\n\nWe've made significant progress in Iraq, in terms of clearing and holding cities, training Iraqi Security Forces, and transitioning power to the new government. However, the insurgency continues to employ tactics such as improvised explosive devices, ambushes, and kidnappings to disrupt these efforts.\n\nOne of the main challenges we face is a lack of a clear central authority in Iraq. The former regime of Saddam Hussein fractured the nation, and the insurgency has taken advantage of this vacuum. In addition, the presence of foreign fighters - many of whom are now being released from prison or entering the country - helps to sustain the insurgency.\n\nNow, I know we've faced setbacks in the past year, including the midterm elections in Iraq. Make no mistake, we understand that those setbacks were frustrating for the American people. However, we also know that the long-term goal is more important than short-term election results. That goal is an Iraq that can govern itself, secure itself, and be a friend of the United States.\n\nNow, I want to emphasize that it's not simply a matter of just stepping up the military presence or upping the ante. The solution to this conflict involves a multifaceted approach. We need to continue to build a stable government, support education and economic development, promote security and stability across the country, and address the needs of the Iraqis so they can begin to build their own future.\n\nAnd so, that's where we are.

In the near-term, we're going to focus on increasing supply, not just on exploring new ways to get more oil on the market. One way to do that is through conservation. I'm urging Americans to contribute by conserving fuel, carpooling, using public transportation, and more diligent maintenance on our vehicles.\n\nAnother way is by the ethanol program, which is a great example of American ingenuity and the farm bill that we signed into law last year. This renewable fuel is already being produced, it's getting Americans off foreign oil, and it's making our air cleaner. I'm also talking to Congress about increasing our refining capacity, so that we can get more oil from global markets into America.\n\nTo help low-income Americans, who are always being hit first when prices rise, we have a tax credit program, the Working Family Tax Relief Tax Act, which helps alleviate some of the burden. Lastly, I'm urging OPEC to consider price cuts, because it's an overpriced market."

And yes, the resolution on Ukraine will indeed be on the agenda in Evian, France, where the G-8 is scheduled to take place next month. We're working closely with our international partners to address this critical situation, and we'll continue to use all available diplomatic tools to achieve a peaceful resolution.\n\nIn terms of my travel schedule, I expect to attend the G-8 Summit in Evian as planned. And then, of course, I'll be heading to Turkey for the Asia-Europe Summit in Istanbul. I'm looking forward to engaging with world leaders on a range of issues, from global security to economic growth and cooperation."

As you know, I've been traveling extensively throughout our nation, visiting states that are heavily impacted by the high price of oil, and speaking with the American people about the steps we can take to address this challenge.\n\nIn addition to the energy proposals I've outlined, we are actively working to increase domestic production, particularly in the area of offshore drilling, which I believe would help meet our growing demand for oil and gas while reducing our reliance on foreign imports.\n\nWe are also working with our partners in other countries to promote development of new energy sources and to negotiate better access to energy resources. And, we're investing in alternative energy sources, such as ethanol, biodiesel, and nuclear power, which will not only help reduce our dependence on foreign oil but also create new jobs and stimulate our economy.\n\nWe're also looking at ways to improve our refining capacity, making sure we have enough refineries in the United States to meet our domestic energy needs. And, we're taking steps to increase energy conservation, encouraging Americans to be more energy-efficient in their daily lives.\n\nI want to remind people that in the short term, prices will fluctuate based on global demand and supply. But in the long term, we're committed to being energy independent, and I'm confident that with the right policies, we can achieve that goal.\n\nI also want to remind you, I've asked my Secretary, Condi Rice to conduct a comprehensive review of the oil market, to identify any and all factors that might be contributing to these price spikes, and to recommend courses of action to mitigate the problem.\n\nWe're taking a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach to address the high price of oil, and I'm committed to working with Congress, with industry leaders, and with the American people to find solutions to this challenge. Thank you."

However, I believe it's not that we've been tough on business; we've been tough on tax laws and free market principles that eliminate barriers for entrepreneurs to create jobs.\n\nThat being said, we have implemented policies that benefit the working class and low-income earners; for instance, the tax cut we passed in 2001 and again in 2003, lowered taxes for 92% of American households, with a little over half receiving the maximum benefit. I believe many of these households are the ones that are driving our economy forward."

I have indeed spoken out on the need to bridge the partisan divide, and I believe that's crucial for the health of our democracy.\n\nI think there's no doubt that the partisan atmosphere in Washington has become more intense over the years. And I think one of the reasons for this is the way we choose our leaders. In a lot of states, the winner-takes-all approach can sometimes lead to a winner and a loser. And that can create bitterness, especially in districts that are closely divided. But that's just one of many factors.\n\nNow, do I think I bear some responsibility for the atmosphere here in Washington? I do. I was the President for eight years, and we did a lot of things that really did spark a lot of passion and debate. However, I think my heart's always been about the American people, and I think that my actions were guided by a desire to serve them. I wish that there was less partisanship, but I also know that's a challenge - it's not something that can be easily fixed overnight.\n\nLooking back, I do think that maybe I was too partisan sometimes, especially in 2004, as you know, when the election was a... a very contentious one. But I always tried to do what I thought was right, and I think that's what America's citizens want from their leaders. It's not always easy, but I do think I acted with the best of intentions, and that's the most important thing.\n\nI think that all Americans, including the most partisan among us, share a common goal - that's to keep our country great, strong, and free. I do believe we can keep working towards that goal, together."

Now, in my dealings with President Putin, I've been clear about the importance of democracy in Georgia, in Ukraine, and in Moldova.  And I've had good discussions with him about the implications of his actions on democracies on his borders.\n\nComplimenting President Putin on a particular speech, I think, is one way to put it.  I was saying it was a positive statement for freedom.  And I believe that we have a partnership with Russia that is firmly grounded in the values of freedom, of individual liberty, and of human rights.\n\nTo be clear, however, I've also emphasized that while rhetoric is important, there must be action.  And I've encouraged Russia to take concrete steps that support democracy and freedom across its borders.\n\nOne key area of concern is the situations in Georgia and Ukraine.  I've been talking to the Russians about the importance of granting Georgia independence in its relations with Osetia and Abkhazia, as well as giving Ukraine autonomy in Crimea.  The bottom line is this, I believe Russia has the power to influence the situation and to help create the conditions for stability and prosperity in the Black Sea region.\n\nNow, the progress has been slow, but I think we're making some progress."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you.  I'm glad to be here today, and I appreciate the question. I think there are several issues that have driven the divergence in opinions between Republicans and Democrats. \n\nFirst and foremost, I believe it's no secret that Democrats have taken issue with my administration's stance on, and the willingness to engage in, military action in Iraq. As you know, the decision to liberate Iraq from Saddam Hussein's tyranny has been a contentious one. While many Americans, including those who identify as Democrats, believe that Saddam was a threat and that his removal was justified, others have expressed concerns about the potential costs and benefits of this action.\n\nAnother area of disagreement, I think, lies in our administration's economic policies. Specifically, the tax cuts that we've enacted have been seen by some as unfairly redistributing wealth upward, while others see them as critical to spurring economic growth and job creation. We believe that by reducing taxes, particularly for small businesses, we can create jobs and stimulate investment in American industries.\n\nAdditionally, the politics surrounding the hurricanes that have hit the Gulf Coast, particularly Hurricane Katrina, have been an area of concern for Democrats. Some feel that the federal response was inadequate or insufficient, and that we should have done more to prepare for and respond to the crisis.\n\nAnd, of course, there are other issues that have created division, such as the.environmnetal policies that we've pursued. Some Democrats believe that we have, as a country, not done enough to address theissue of climate change and global warming, whereas we've taken steps, through initiatives such as the Clear Skies and No Child Left Behind Acts, to invest in cleaner energy sources and improve the well-being of our citizens."

As a matter of fact, I appreciate your question.\n\nFirst, let me say that we're doing everything in our power to address the price of gasoline. The U.S. is not the only country facing this challenge, by the way. The global demand for oil is at an all-time high, and there are disruptions in supply. These factors contribute to the high prices.\n\nNow, to directly answer your question, we believe the tax relief package that I signed into law, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, will help bring needed relief to American families and small business owners.\n\nAs for the politics, I don't make decisions based on polls or public opinion. I make decisions on what I believe is right for the American people. I understand that some of my policies have been questioned and scrutinized, but I'm confident that the American people see that I'm working diligently to make their lives better.\n\nAs for the price I'm paying, I'd say it's not just about economic challenges; it's about leadership. It's about being prepared to make tough decisions, and that's what I've done throughout my life. And I'll keep doing it for the American people.\n\nSo, we'll continue working to address this issue and to keep America moving forward, even with all the challenges we're facing today."

Let me address that statement directly.\n\nAs you know, the monitoring and tracking of Osama bin Laden has been a top priority for our government since the terrorist attacks on September 11th, 2001. Now, let me see if I can recall... As I understand it, the intelligence communities continued to work diligently on tracking down bin Laden. As president-elect, I certainly was not complacent and expected the outgoing administration to pass on every single piece of information regarding the pursuit of bin Laden. However, after careful review, I can tell you that it appears that while some meetings did not occur between U.S. agencies on this particular matter for several months, it was not due to a lack of interest or effort.\n\nNow, I've directed our counsel, Alberto Gonzales, to do some digging on this, and after he reviewed the records, it became apparent that the focus was indeed on other aspects of counter-terrorism operations. Nevertheless, I want to be clear: my administration did not ignore this priority. We've been driven forward, consistent with presidential instruction and congressional support, to harvest as much information on bin Laden's whereabouts.\n\nMr. Clinton, in his term, indeed faced a horrific attack on our soil, but after the fact. During my Administration, we continually made national security a paramount focus. The efforts and intelligence gathering continued to ensure a U.S. posture with unwavering will to bring this threat to justice."

Their nuclear plans are a threat to peace and stability in the region, and to the world.\n\nThe fact is, Saddam Hussein was a more destabilizing force, higher oil prices were not--\n(laughs) excuse me. \nThe fact is, the price of oil is driven by a variety of factors. Global demand, I believe, is a key factor. And I also think, the uncertainties in the world - and again, this is a terrorist-supporting regime we're dealing with - the uncertainty they've created in the region is also a factor.\n\nWe will not blink in the face of their aggression. We will reiterate our policy of seeking a diplomatic solution, that is, a return to the NPT, no nuclear weapons for Iran. But we will also continue to develop and discuss with our international partners the options for containing and dealing with this threat.\n\nAnd I remind you that OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, sets prices for oil. They're a bunch of sovereign nations, and they make their decisions based on what the market will bear and their own needs. We will not get our positions adjusted to stop talking about our concerns of the Iranian threat in order to get a lower price of gas.\n\nI know that's what people want to hear.

And we've worked closely with our allies, particularly in NATO, to address our collective security concerns.\n\nI think it's also worth noting that some of our critics have criticized us for not unilaterally engaging in international institutions, but I'd argue that we've found effective ways to work through these institutions while also taking bold action when necessary, as we did in the case of liberating Iraq.\n\nNow, I understand that there will always be criticism of any president's foreign policy. But I'm proud of what we've accomplished, and I believe that our approach has made America safer and more secure, while also advancing our values and interests.\n\nIn terms of the danger of going it alone, I think that's a fair critique if that means we're ignoring international norms and institutions. But in our case, we've tried to work within those systems and alliances to achieve our goals. We've also been willing to take risks and make tough decisions when necessary, as I think history will show that we did in the case of Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nMake no bones about it, I think it's a mistake to think that the world is safer or more secure because we're not taking action to address threats. As president, it's not my job to ask the permission of other nations to protect America and the American people. It's my duty to do what's necessary to keep us safe, and I believe that's exactly what we've done."

I've instructed our Secretary of State, my friend Colin Powell, to work closely with international partners, particularly the Quartet on the Middle East - the United States, the European Union, Russia, and the U.N. - to help ensure a smooth transition and to support reform in the Palestinian territories.\n\nRegarding Israel, we urge the government of Israel to continue their efforts to dismantle outposts that are in exacerbating this situation and to resume the stalled road map process, which we believe holds the key to peace. We expect both sides to commit fully to meeting their obligations under the road map, including those related to internal Palestinian reform and the dismantling of terrorist organizations.\n\nRegarding West Bank settlement expansion, we believe it's essential that Israel freezes settlement activity, not the entire settlement, just settlement activity. We're hoping that the freeze cuts both ways - a mutual ceasefire, in other words, with all parties involved. President Abu Mazen has said settlements are an obstacle to peace and so have we. I've told Prime Minister Sharon that we want to work with them to revitalize the road map, to get the road map to move, but we need both parties to move forward in a way that sustains peace, brings confidence, and showcases a clear commitment to statehood and security, not proliferation.\n\nAnd, I want to add that, make no mistake, democracy is a two-way street - if you want to elect a popular parliament, and I wish you well on that, it just doesn't sit well with us if you set up roadblocks and break the rule of law."

The situation on the ground in Iraq is fluid, and you're right, some of our allies have chosen to reduce their troop levels. But that doesn't change the fact that the stakes are high, and the threat posed by these terrorist organizations, by the remnants of Saddam Hussein's regime, is still very real.\n\nNow, I remember when the United Nations passed Resolution 1441, which set the terms for Saddam Hussein's disarmament. And Resolution 1441 said that Iraq had a duty to disarm, not us. And we believe that it's our duty to protect our friends and allies, protect the Iraqi people, and complete our mission to ensure that Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction do not fall into the wrong hands.\n\nNow, regarding the cost - we're committed to working with our allies to build a coalition of the willing, and we're working to find ways to share the burden fairly.

As you know, this administration has consistently maintained that all options are on the table when it comes to dealing with the situation in Iraq. However, as far as direct engagement with Syria and Iran, I believe that approach would put our progress at risk.\n\nFirstly, Iran is already not an ally in this region, and engaging in diplomacy with them comes with real risks. We cannot have a simplistic, naive view that talking to anyone is always better. The Iranian regime is untrustworthy and their actions are not compatible with what we stand for.\n\nRegarding Syria, their own well-being is tied up with the Sudanese dictator Qaddafi. This means that as long as Syria has Qaddafi backing them, talking to them is unlikely to yield any meaningful results. Furthermore, as we all know, intelligence gathering and monitoring is key in this conflict, and this regime's inability to prevent Al-Qaeda's increased infiltration has put us in a tough situation.\n\nSo while diplomacy is part of our policy toolbox, we must first demonstrate the worthiness of a regime to assist, which means curtailing their terrorist supporting nature first.\n\nIn diplomatic terms, 'problem countries' don't typically desire, nor are likely to tell truth about what real intentions are.

Let me tell you, I want to be clear: our strategy in Iraq is to fight on, to complete the mission, and to ensure the terrorists and insurgents understand that we will not be deterred in our objective to establish a stable, free, and sovereign Iraq.\n\nThe reports you're referring to, I believe, were an interview I gave to a Scottish newspaper, where I mentioned that I'm pleased we're making progress in several key areas of the country. And that's true. We're making progress in fighting the terrorists, we're making progress in building Iraqi security forces, and we're making progress in establishing democracy.\n\nHowever, I must say that this administration's commitment to staying in Iraq until the job is done is unwavering. We will continue to work with the Iraqi government, the Iraqi people, and our coalition partners to ensure that the terrorist network in Iraq is defeated and that the Iraqi people can enjoy stability and security.\n\nNow, I know some folks might be confused by some of the rhetoric coming from my administration. What I want to assure the American people is that we're committed to seeing this through, and we're not going to falter or fail. We will triumph in this struggle, and we will secure the peace in Iraq."

    "gen_response": "(laughs) Well, thank you for that question. As I reflect back on my time in office, I've given a lot of thought to the term \"sustainable,\" and I appreciate your question.\n\nNow, I know some folks might have a different definition of \"sustainable.\" But to me, sustainable means a whole lot of things. It means that our economy is strong, that we're not burdening future generations with excessive debt. It means that our environment is healthy, that we're taking care of the natural resources that God gave us. And it means that our social safety net is strong, that all Americans have access to opportunities to succeed.\n\nWhen it comes to specific goals and objectives, we've made some significant progress in these areas. We've been committed to reducing our dependency on foreign oil, and we've seen some success in recent years. Alternative energy, like ethanol and wind power, are becoming more viable, and we're investing in research to make sure we're a leader in renewable energy.\n\nOn the economic front, we've seen some dramatic growth since 2001, and we've reduced the inherited budget deficits that came with the president before me. We've also made significant investments in healthcare, education, and social services.\n\nBut I will say that there's much more work to be done. As I look out at the future, I want to see continued progress in those areas, and I want to make sure that our policies are creating opportunities for all Americans, not just a select few. That's what I mean by sustainable. That's what I hope to be remembered for.\n\nNow, I know there are some folks who might say, \"Well, President Bush, you haven't done enough on the environmental front.\" And I understand that. I understand that. We can do better, and we should do better. And I'm committed to continuing to work on that.\n\nBut in the end, I believe that the American people know what it means to be sustainable. They know what it means to live within our means, to take care of our children, and to build for the future. And that's what I've tried to do as your president."

I'm aware of the ongoing attempts against President Karzai's life, and I want to assure the American people that we're working closely with the President of Afghanistan and our international partners to ensure his safety and security.\n\nRegarding our strategy, I believe we're making progress in Afghanistan. Operation Enduring Freedom and ISAF, the International Security Assistance Force, have helped to drive al-Qaeda and the Taliban from power, and our military operations have disrupted their ability to plan and carry out terrorist attacks.\n\nHowever, the struggle against terrorism and insurgency is ongoing, and there are still many challenges ahead. We face a determined and ruthless enemy, one that will not give up easily. Our mission is to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaeda and the Taliban, and we're committed to seeing that mission through to its completion.\n\nNow, I know some folks might be asking, are we winning, or are we losing? The answer is, we're making progress. We've got a long way to go, but I'm confident in our military's ability to adapt and overcome. The bravery and sacrifice of our troops inspire me every day, and I'm proud to lead this great nation and its men and women in uniform.\n\nBut let's be clear: our strategy is not just about military operations. We're also working to build a stable, self-sustaining democracy in Afghanistan, one that has the capacity to secure its own future and not be dependent on outside support. That's why I'm pleased with the progress we've made on security sector reform, on training an Afghan army, on economic development, and on helping the Afghan people build a better future for themselves.\n\nSo, while there's still much work to be done, I'm optimistic about our strategy. I'm optimistic that we will ultimately prevail in this fight against terrorism, and that Afghanistan will become a stable, free, and democratic nation."

Let me tell you, we've worked hard to develop a policy that will help stimulate the economy, help hardworking Americans, and reduce the burden of taxation on families and businesses.\n\nWe've taken a close look at the concerns from our colleagues in the Senate, and we're willing to make some adjustments to the plan to ensure its passage. I'm not throwing in the towel just yet. In fact, we'll continue to work with our Republican colleagues to address their concerns and improve the plan.\n\nNow, I haven't ruled out scaling back the size of the plan as one option. We want to make sure we've got a Republican plan that can pass the Senate and then withstand scrutiny in the House of Representatives. We've got to be practical about this. If that means making some compromises, then we're willing to do that.\n\nHowever, our commitment to the principles behind this plan remains unchanged: reduce the overall tax burden, particularly on families and small businesses, and make our tax code simpler and more competitive with the rest of the world. We believe that these are essential for long-term economic growth and we're determined to get it done."

We'll work with whomever we can, whenever we can, to address the pressing issues facing our nation.\n\nNotwithstanding our differences, I'm optimistic about the prospect of working together with...

We'll put aside our politics, focus on the substance, and achieve reforms that will benefit the American people.\n\nI'm committed to working with both parties to fix our tax code, to simplify our tax system, to create jobs, to promote energy independence, and to keep our nation strong and free. That's the American way. And I believe, if we work together, we can get the job done."

Our administration is committed to addressing our nation's fiscal responsibilities, and I have been working closely with my economic team to find a solution.\n\nThe plan to borrow money from the Social Security Trust Fund to temporarily increase the debt limit is not a new idea, but I agree it's a complicated issue and it's understandable you'd want to know the justification. \n\nFirst of all, let's be clear, these funds are not being permanently redirected from the Social Security Trust Fund. They're being borrowed for a short period of time, from to the tune of about $725 billion, with the understanding that it will be paid back with interest, with interest accrued, to the Trust Fund.\n\nIn these times of uncertainty and global turmoil, our budget is required to be as stable as possible. This proposal is critical to not only managing this great nation' budget, but allowing our businesses and families to harness confidence from economic development.\n\nNow, in the long-term, I understand that it is key to make permanent plans to further funding for social security. As a nation, we should and will work on debt reduction as well as long-term financial solvency. It is also of paramount importance to ensure the strength of the American economy.\n\nHaving meaningful statutory budget control changes are also minimize the need for suspending the debt limit like this while, at the same time ensuring we putting America on the path of financial health with a balanced budget remains a key policy goal.\n\nNow to sum it up, the method we are utilizing ther isn't perfection, but we're proactively taking steps to maintain economic stability, restore people's faith in the US Economy."

However, I'm also committed to being a pragmatic leader, who puts the interests of the American people first.\n\nReaching out to Democrats is not about abandoning our core principles, but about finding common ground and working together to address the challenges that face our nation. I've worked with Senator Ted Kennedy, in fact, on several issues, and I believe that's a good thing. We've got great Americans from both sides of the aisle who want to get things done, and I'm committed to putting the needs of the American people above partisan politics.\n\nYou know, I ran on a platform that included tax cuts, education reform, and social security reform, and we're making progress on those fronts. But there's a lot more to do, and I believe that by reaching out and working with our friends across the aisle, we can get even more done for the American people.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, I'm not governed by the conservative wing of the party. I'm governed by what I believe is in the best interests of the American people, and if that means working with Democrats, then that's what we'll do."

First, let me say that the situation in Liberia is a concern to us, and we'll continue to work closely with our international partners, including the United Nations, to alleviate the humanitarian crisis there. We've already provided support with non-military aid, and we're committed to protecting American interests.\n\nRegarding your question about sending American troops, I can tell you that we're reviewing various options. However, at this time, I don't have any announcements to make about large-scale troop deployments to Liberia. Our policy is to use military force judiciously, and any decision would be based on a thorough evaluation of the circumstances on the ground.\n\nAs for stretching the US military thin, we take the global footprint of our military operations very seriously. We're committed to our national security, and we'll continue to support international stability and defend our friends and allies. However, we must be mindful of our capabilities and resources. As Commander-in-Chief, I must make tough decisions to ensure that our military is prepared for any challenges that arise.\n\nWe've had a long-standing commitment to the global community, from supporting our allies in Europe and Asia, to combating terrorism in the Middle East, to providing humanitarian aid where needed. But I believe that with a strong, confident America, we can continue to play a leading role in securing global peace and freedom, without overextending our military.\n\nWe'll continue to balance our global commitments, taking a thoughtful and comprehensive approach to our national security priorities. We'll act when necessary, but we won't overcommit. Our military should always be prepared to defend us at home, secure our interests abroad, and carry out the tasks that we've entrusted to them.\n\nI appreciate your understanding, and I'm happy to take more questions if you have them."

The Iraq Stabilization Group, also known as the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Finance Trust Fund, was an initiative that was put into place to help the people of Iraq rebuild their country after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.\n\nThis is a new try to reorganize efforts by using my special envoy, Ambassador L Paul Bremer, to assess the situation and to help the Iraqis, not just the CPA but the central government of Iraq, to help them gather itself and present a new way of making decisions and pursuing our mutual goals in that country.\n\nAs for the question of saying the effort to stabilize Iraq is flagging, I'd say no, that's not an accurate characterization of the situation. We're making steady progress in Iraq. We've got an interim government in place, there's been significant reductions in violence, and we're making good progress with our military effort.\n\nHowever, there might be some confusion on my part and this new program, the authorization doesn't do any one person a significant amount of authority, my administration works closely with Paul Bremer and our Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld.

Their service and sacrifice will never be forgotten.\n\nRegarding the violence in Iraq, I want to remind you that the situation there is complex, and progress is being made. While the highest-level violence of the insurgency has indeed subsided since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime, we still face a determined enemy that resorts to terrorism and violence.\n\nWe had expected that the level of violence would ebb and flow, similar to what we saw in other countries as they transition from authoritarian rule to a fledgling democracy. However, I want to assure the American people that we are taking a proactive and multifaceted approach to address the situation, working with the Iraqi government to develop their security forces and institutions.\n\nThe civil war between Shia and Sunni factions, the remnants of the Baathist remnants, the insurgency - all these factors make it a challenging situation. But we will not abandon the Iraqi people. We will continue to support them, provide them with the necessary training, equipment, and intelligence to consolidate their gains and build a stable and secure Iraq.\n\nWe've made progress in the Past year. We have over 80% of Iraq's provinces are stable and secure. We've made significant progress in rebuilding their infrastructure, in delivering humanitarian aid, and in helping the Iraqi people have a more representative government. While the road ahead will be difficult, we're committed to success."

As we rebuild and restore our nation after the attacks of 9/11, I believe we need to show the American public that we're willing to work together to achieve our common goals.\n\nRegarding a consensus candidate for the Supreme Court, I believe it's a great idea.  We're going to reach out across party lines, to seek out the very best qualified judges who share our values and principles.  I've stated before, it's not about finding a liberal or a conservative, it's about finding a good person. \n\nNow, I've already started that process by reaching out to some individuals with the help of Chief Justice Scalia and Attorney General Ashcroft, and I'm optimistic about the outcome. In the meantime, in our cabinet, we will nominate the best qualified people, regardless of party. I'm committed to it, but we are going to fill all government positions with people who share our values.\n\nThere're many members of both parties who thoughtfully support the type of fundamental principles we're trying to achieve here. We've already reached out to and already seen the inclusion of Senator Collins on my staff as an unpaid advisor on drug policy. By taking these positive steps forward, we can restore trust in the process and move America forward."

The lifting of the 15-year arms embargo on China, I have made it clear that it's a matter of great concern for the United States.  Allowing China to acquire more advanced military capabilities would undermine regional stability and create a different balance of power in the world.\n\nIf the European countries go forward with lifting the embargo, it would be perceived as a sign of diminished resolve to enforce our values of arms control and non-proliferation.  It would also send a signal that major powers can disregard the international community's collective judgments on these matters and do as they please.\n\nNow, I understand the need for our European friends to seek closer ties with China, and I welcome that engagement. But lifting the arms embargo would go against the principles of stability and security in the region, and it would make it more difficult for us to address our common challenges, including the threat of proliferation of nuclear and missile technology.\n\nAs for whether it can be done in a way that would satisfy our concerns, I have made it clear that it's not just a question of how it's done, but whether it's done at all."

The international community has been clear: Iran must suspend its nuclear program and allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to verify that they're not using their nuclear programs to develop a nuclear weapon. \n\nLet me be crystal clear: the threat to the world from Iran's nuclear ambitions is very serious. There are risks associated with this program that go far beyond the safety and security of the Middle East. We're talking about a nation with a history of aggressive behavior and a capability to potentially menace the world with a nuclear arsenal.\n\nI believe we must consider all options open to us to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. We will continue to work with our allies in the international community to address this crisis through diplomacy and multilateral action. However, if necessary, we will take military action against any nation that threatens the security of the free world.\n\nI want to emphasize that a military strike is not our first choice, but we will do what's necessary to ensure that there's no nuclear terror regime taking root. I have full confidence in our intelligence agencies and the hard work being done by the United States and other nations to resolve this issue peacefully. But we will not back down from our commitment to the safety and security of America and our friends around the world.\n\nI want to reiterate that the ball's in Iran's court, and we hope they do the right thing.

Let me be clear: our advice to China is about how they can build a more open and free society, how they can respect the rights of their own citizens, and how they can take a more active role in global affairs. I don't think it's prudent or wise for me to advise China on how to structure their government.\n\nWhat I do believe is that the system of governance in Taiwan is one that is certainly beneficial to its people. Their democratic institutions are robust, free markets have created tremendous economic growth and prosperity, and the relationship between Taiwan and their government is one in which the power is more diffused and accountable. However, that's not the same as saying we want China to copy the specific example of Taiwan. Our view is that China should and can have their own path to reform.\n\nChina is a vast and complex society with its own traditions, history, and culture. And it's to the Chinese people that we extend the opportunity to develop their own system that suits their own unique circumstances. We just encourage them to be responsive to the aspirations of their citizens, and to be open to the world.\n\nNow, I do want to make one thing clear, we oppose the use of force, across the Taiwan Strait. And I have been consistent in my views on this question. Personal experiences in the 2000 summit at APEC were significant: Xi Jinping, you mentioned you would reunify Taiwan to the motherland with non-peaceful means was necessary. We reject that authority of the people that directs sovereignty lies with the stomach to use force."

We've been working closely with international partners, including the European Union and our friends in the Middle East, to pressure Iran to comply with its obligations.\n\nFirst, let me say that I believe economic sanctions are a legitimate tool to influence Iran's behavior. I've already directed my team to examine possible measures, including freezing assets, restricting travel of key Iranian officials, and restricting the export of sensitive technologies.\n\nHowever, to get Russian and Chinese support, we need to work with them to ensure that these sanctions are targeted and proportional. We must also work with them to address their concerns and interests, particularly on the non-proliferation issue. I believe that if we can demonstrate the sanctions will not harm their interests and will effectively pressure Iran to change its behavior, we can gain their support.\n\nI'm confident that our friends in Russia and China understand that a nuclear-armed Iran is a threat to regional and global stability. We need to work together to convince them that we have a long-term approach to this crisis, not just a short-term fix. I'm open to negotiating with them, to find common ground on sanctions that will give Iran a decisive choice: to verify, suspend, and ultimately, dismantle its nuclear program.\n\nI've also instructed my Secretary of State Colin Powell to engage our diplomatic efforts directly with the Russians and Chinese, to hammer out a unified international stance on this. We're working closely with our allies and friends in the region, to solidify their support for a united response to this challenge.\n\nAt the end of the day, the goal remains the same: to prevent Iran from achieving nuclear capability and to advance the cause of peace and security for the world.\n\nSo, that's where I stand on this issue today. Thank you."

We want to work with the Iraqis to determine the best way forward in this new era of freedom and democracy for their nation.  Our aim, as a military operation, is to help the Iraqis - to assist them as they stand up.  \n\nIn terms of bases, it's true that we had initially sought to keep some presence to enforce a capability in that theatre to fight the war on terror.  And, as you know, the United States has no intention of becoming the new colonial power in Iraq.  So, any sort of permanent bases would have to be, in our view, on the terms agreed upon by the Iraqis themselves.\n\nNow, as you can imagine, we would like the U.S. to maintain certain bases there, if that's what's -- if that's what the Iraqi government decides they want, and has any reason for that."

Thank you.\n\nAs Commander-in-Chief, I believe it's my duty and responsibility to ensure the security and safety of our troops, and to make decisions that will ultimately lead to a victorious conclusion in Iraq. However, I also believe that it's essential to work closely with Congress in carrying out our mission.\n\nWhile I understand that Congress has a constitutional role in advising and consenting in matters of war, I must remind you that the President has inherent authority as Commander-in- Chief to make key decisions regarding the conduct of our military.\n\nThis proposed bill would undermine the authority of the President and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to make tactical decisions on the ground. I fear that it would create a situation where our troops would be mired in a process of constantly seeking congressional approval for every major action. That's not how wars are fought. Decisions need to be made quickly, often with incomplete information.\n\nThat being said, I do value the input of Congress. In fact, I've met with members of Congress repeatedly to discuss our strategy in Iraq. However, I must insist that we find a balance between their oversight and the need for swift action on the battlefield.\n\nI'm willing to engage in a consultative process with Congress, to provide them with regular updates and briefings on the situation in Iraq, to answer their questions, and to work with them to build a bipartisan consensus on our goals and objectives. But I will not be micromanaged by Congress, and I will not be forced to second-guess the men and women on the ground who are putting their lives on the line for our country."

I'm happy to share my thoughts on the future of the European Union and its relations with the United States. \n\nAs I reflect on my time in office, I was proud of the strong alliance we had with the European Union and individual European nations.  In the early days of my presidency, our strongest relationship during the response to the 9/11, and later into the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, we experienced a good partnership, but sometimes, I have to agree, disagreements arose over Iraq. And that tested the resolve of relations between our nations.\n\nHowever, we worked through many challenges together, maintaining a strong alliance based on shared values such as democracy, freedom, and a mutual commitment to stability and security in the world. During my presidency, we cooperated closely on counter-terrorism, non-proliferation, and global economic issues.\n\nMoving forward, I envision a continued strong partnership between the United States and the EU, especially now as the world faces new challenges. One key priority will be tackling the threat of terrorism, engaging in efforts to combat climate change, and other global issues. \n\nI have the utmost respect for the United Kingdom as they navigate leaving the EU, which was a groundbreaking step in recent years. As others may eventually choose a similar path, the EU and the US will need to work closely on facilitating a smooth transition for both sides and adjusting our respective positions in the global system.\n\nHowever, we must stay committed to pursuing common goals that require our joint cooperation. There's a notable backdrop of certain irritants, mainly a trade deficit where the EU has faced criticism from the US side, however, we must rely on mutual understanding to solve issues before they boil over into major disputes.\n\nThe relationship between the United States and the European Union has undoubtedly its unique ingredients. While past conflicts took a toll, we have gone a long way to re-establish and solidify our ties. In pursuit of peace, prosperity, and security, the American people and the people of the EU will come out more solid than ever as partners for that brighter future."

Now, let me be clear: our primary focus in this bailout package is on stabilizing our financial system. We've got many good folks at risk of losing their homes, and many good businesses at risk of failing. The strain on our economy, as a result of the near collapse of some of our financial institutions, is far-reaching.\n\nThat being said, we understand the importance of addressing the situation of those at risk of foreclosure. In fact, SecretaryHUD, together with the Treasury Department, are working on various initiatives to give relief to homeowners struggling with their loans.\n\nRegarding the middle class and unemployment benefits, we have a record number of Americans working, and record low unemployment, before this crisis. The measures we're discussing today don't directly address those concerns, but they do contain provisions that we believe will help stabilize the economy and create jobs.\n\nIf you look at what we're trying to do for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, this help \u2013 this infusion \u2013 should help keep people employed in those industries. That's how I see it. However, we're, as a government, continually evaluating our programs to see where we might have a chance to implement some additional measures that'll strike that balance between immediate recovery and long-term growth.\n\nWe will continue to work closely with our partners on Capitol Hill to address these questions (emphasizing) and seek a comprehensive solution that addresses multiple aspects of the Economic crisis we're facing."

Now, I know that I've had a long-standing relationship with the oil industry. In fact, my family has been involved in the oil business for many years. And that's a point of concern to a lot of people.\n\nBut let me tell you, my No. 1 goal as President is to make sure that the energy policy we're implementing is in the best interest of the American people, not just the oil industry. We're working on a comprehensive energy plan to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, to invest in new technologies that will increase our domestic energy production, and to help American consumers pay lower energy costs.\n\nNow, Dick Cheney, as a former CEO of Halliburton \u2013 I know that's a valid point of interest \u2013 he has certainly got experience in the energy industry. But he also shares the same commitment to America's energy security and our independence that I do.\n\nIn fact, our administration's comprehensive energy plan has five main parts. One, we're going to increase the use of ethanol, to create jobs and grow agriculture in our Great Plains. Two, we're going to invest in new technologies to increase our supply of natural gas, and reduce America's dependence on Venezuelan oil and Middle Eastern oil. Three, we're going to ensure that we're using our domestic resources \u2013 natural gas, oil, coal \u2013 in a responsible manner that protects the environment. Four, we're going to make America more productive and competitive. And five, we're going to push forward with hydrogen fuel cells and other new technologies that will revolutionize the way we use energy.\n\nNow, I know some people in the media won't believe this because of preconcieved notions - that we're just trying to help out the special interest. But that is just not true. This is a policy meant to make America freer, safer, and more prosperous."

    "gen_response": "That's a fair question. The differences in these two initiatives can be best explained by looking at their scopes and purposes.\n\nThe International Treaty on Climate Change is a global effort aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions through negotiations with countries worldwide, establishing international cooperation, and imposed legal frameworks. If the scientific evidence regarding the Kyoto Protocol was deemed insufficient by the Senate and other nations, that decision has been made based on a variety of factors including the lack of obligations for developing countries and concerns  regarding its potential economic impacts on the US.\n\nOn the other hand, the missile defense system I proposed has a more localized and nation-to-nation approach. Our focus is on developing a defensive capability to protect the American people and our interests from rogue states that might use ballistic missiles to threaten or harm the United States. In terms of science and technology, there have been significant advances in the field of missile defense, that\u2019s why I stood by the concept, though this of course, it\u2019s based on different criteria than the Climate Change initiative.\n\nBy way of example, programs like the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) System or the ship-based Aegis missile defense system have shown potential in being able to intercept and destroy a missile while in mid-course. Now, I know some critics would have us  tell you that this doesn't work yet. They said the same about the movie projector in term of daylight ICBMs that used to be the priority.  And took years to reach an \u2018operational success\u2019."

We'll keep working to address these challenges and capture the opportunities of globalization that benefit the many, not just the few.\n\nIn the end, President Putin and I agreed that the G-8 made significant progress, and we'll continue to build on these discussions in St. Petersburg."

And I respect the U.N. and its purposes. However, let me be clear: the United Nations is not the only authority when it comes to international security, and the United States has a responsibility to protect its citizens and its interests at all costs.\n\nThe question of going ahead with military action without U.N. authorization is a complex one. When I look back on the lessons of the past, from Desert Storm to theGenocide in Rwanda and Bosnia, I believe we must act when we can, and sometimes that means acting without a U.N. mandate, but with a clear understanding of our responsibility to protect civilians, to prevent acute humanitarian crises, and to defend our interests.\n\nBut we also believe, and I believe it firmly, the coalition of willing partners that we have gathered together with us, shares that same conviction. So, as we continue to move forward on the situation in Iraq, it's not about being defiant to the U.N. or to any international institutions; it's about our strong belief in our values, our interests, and our responsibility to be the force of good in this world.\n\nSo while the U.N. process is an important one, and we'll continue to work with them, let me say it very clearly: the United States will not be deterred from taking action when our vital interests are at stake and our values demand it.

Of course, the effectiveness of our military operations is also a result of weeks of intense planning and preparation, and I'm proud of the work our troops are doing in bringing stability and freedom to Iraq.\n\nRegarding the site of last night's attack, I can confirm that the target was indeed a geographically verified site where Saddam was thought to be present.  However, I cannot confirm whether or not Saddam has been confirmed dead or injured, as that information is still being assessed by our military and intelligence officials.\n\nAnd finally, regarding the recent battles in Baghdad, I would not say that the war is nearly over. While we have made significant gains in recent days, there remains a lot of work to be done to root out Saddam's regime and to bring peace and stability to the people of Iraq. We have entered a crucial phase in this conflict, and we will continue to work tirelessly to achieve our objectives and to bring freedom to the Iraqi people."

We do not consider Hamas an acceptable interlocutor in any significant peace process with Israel. They're a terrorist organization responsible for the suffering of innocent Israelis and Palestinians alike.\n\nMeeting with Hamas leaders doesn't undermine our policies, though.

First, I want to say that I believe the death penalty is a necessary tool for the State and Federal governments to punish those who have committed the most heinous crimes, such as murder, treason, and terrorism.\n\nFirst and foremost, we've increased the funding for clemency and post-conviction review procedures to ensure that all defendants, particularly those who are on death row, get a fair shake. We've also increased the funding for crime labs to make sure that the forensic evidence used in capital cases is reliable, so we can be confident in the convictions.\n\nAt the state level, we've been working closely with governors and state legislatures to pass laws that ensure the integrity of the death penalty process. We're also supporting prison reforms to address the issue of lengthy and unjustified delays in carrying out capital punishment.\n\nAs for the federal level, I've made sure that our Justice Department follows the spirit of the death penalty statutes, making sure that the process is free from racial bias, and that the accused is granted due process.\n\nMoreover, under my administration, we've also tightened the rules of the federal habeas corpus process to prevent ineffective assistance of counsel claims, while also enhancing safeguards to prevent harassment and appeals that can prolong the process.\n\nAnd in 2005, I signed the Innocence Protection Act, which requires U.S. Attorneys to document in federal habeas cases cases which facts exist that may show errors of law, as well as post conviction appeals which raised unsubstantiated judicial leaps.\n\nNow let me be clear about this. I'm a firm believer in the right to life, but when the courts have determined that the State, or in this case the federal government, has enough proof of guilt, it's essential we show we uphold the law by showing justice to the families of victims.\n\nThank you.\""

We're going to take a strong stand, and we're going to lead the world towards peace, safety, and security.\n\nI'm confident, John, that together, we can get this done.

The United States will continue to work with our international partners to address the very real threat posed by North Korea's nuclear program. It is our hope that through our diplomatic efforts, we can convince the North Koreans to dismantle their nuclear ambitions in a peaceful way. But let me be clear: we will not engage in any action, including referring them to the United Nations for sanctions or military action, without the full support and coordination of our allies and partners. Cooperation and unity are essential in dealing with this challenge. I'm pleased to see the collective efforts we've made thus far, and we'll continue to work together to achieve our goal of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.\""

Let me be clear: the United States supports democratic movements and self-determination in any nation where citizens seek freedom and democracy. In Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan, our position is based on the principle that the people of these countries have the right to choose their own government, to establish a system that reflects their values and aspirations.\n\nWe've historically supported democratic movements around the world and worked to promote freedom and human rights. We believe that when citizens desire something different than the government they have, that they should be able to express their will through democratic means. I view these movements as a natural response to oppression, corruption, and authoritarian rule. \n\nConcerns about meddling or interfering would stem from not understanding the values that drive America. The Americans, by our very nature, are a people who believe in freedom, justice and fairness, and we will continue to stand for that around the world. So I disagree with the notion that we have goals of interfering in other countries. We do hope their democratic aspirations are guided towards prosperity and peace.\n\nI would like to give you some examples such as in the case of  Czech Republic in 1989, the Non-Aligned states before that in 1990 or Indonesia, 1998.

Some of his critics have questioned his past decisions as Solicitor General, particularly when it comes to aspects of his role in the Texas colonies and work with the Bush-Chenney revival. I must say I've reviewed the situation closely and believe his work for the American people has been strong and faithful.\n\nAs for the values of the country, I do use the litmus test of appointees. Can I promise them to serve the United States, adhere to our laws and institutions, and uphold our values. I, of course, request of each of the people who will join the administration.

Let me tell you, we're constantly evaluating the situation on the ground in Iraq, and we're committed to supporting our brave men and women in uniform who are over there fighting for freedom.\n\nThe decision to send more troops would be based on the advice of our military leaders, and as you know, we've been having some tough conversations with Gen. Petraeus about the readiness of the Iraqi security forces. We need to see progress being made on the training and equipping of their military, as well as the efforts to stand up the Iraqi government.\n\nNow, as for the timetable of 12 to 18 months, I wouldn't call it a timetable as much as a rough estimate. It's hard to say exactly when we'll reach these benchmarks, but we're focused on making steady progress towards those goals. Our ultimate goal is to transfer security responsibility to the Iraqis and bring our troops home.\n\nWe'll be making tough decisions about troop levels based on the situation on the ground. If we see progress being made, we'll adjust our strategy accordingly. But let me tell you, we're not going to set artificial deadlines that tie our hands in terms of military strategy. We'll continue to make decisions based on the best interests of the United States, and that's to ensure that our men and women are serving a mission that's achievable and worthwhile.\n\nI do want to say that I'm optimistic about the progress we're making in Iraq. We've made significant gains in some areas, and I think we can build on those gains. But we're not in a position to declare victory just yet, and we need to be patient in our expectations. We need to see sustained progress, and we need to see the Iraqis taking ownership of their own destiny.\n\nSo, to answer your question, we're working on a number of scenarios, and we'll take advice from our military leaders as we make any decisions about troop levels. But I can tell you, our focus is on achieving the mission, not on hitting some arbitrary timeline."

Now, with regards to the reports about Iran's nuclear program, I can tell you that we have been working closely with our allies, including Britain, France, and Germany, to deal with this issue.\n\nWe have indeed seen evidence that Iran is continuing its pursuit of nuclear capabilities. As I said before, we don't have a final answer on whether they're seeking a nuclear weapons program, but we do know they're expanding their enrichment facilities, we know they're building more centrifuges, and we know they're developing other technologies that are necessary for a nuclear weapons program.\n\nThis administration has made it clear that a nuclear-armed Iran is unacceptable to us. That's why we're working closely with the IAEA and our other international partners to make clear that there is a consequence for their actions. And we're also working on additional diplomatic efforts to address this issue, and my administration has said that all options are on the table.\n\nSo, to answer your question, yes, we have seen evidence that Iran's program is advancing, and that's why we're taking this issue with the seriousness it deserves."

As I've said before, the stability of the entire region and the advancement of the peace process are of great importance to the United States. While any change in government or withdrawal from coalition does pose risks and challenges, I remain committed to working with the Israeli government to achieve a lasting peace in the Middle East.\n\nI believe in the Israeli people's right to self-defense, and I also believe in the inherent aspiration of all peoples to live in peace and stability. It is our policy to support Israel's right to exist as a sovereign state, and we continue to work towards achieving the two-state solution - two states living side by side, Israel and Palestine, with secure and recognized borders.\n\nI've spoken with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, and we share a common view on the necessity of making progress towards this goal. While the current coalition dynamics are complex, our commitment to Israel's security and the progress towards a peaceful resolution remains unwavering.

The United Nations is an important institution that serves a vital role in promoting international cooperation and peacekeeping. We will continue to be a constructive partner in the U.N., and that includes meeting our financial obligations.\n\nThat being said, we will be reevaluating our participation in the United Nations, and our contribution to it, in light of this vote. I think it's fair to say that this decision has created significant concerns on Capitol Hill, and we'll be working with Congress to assess the best course forward.\n\nBut at this time, we will continue to pay our dues, but we'll be looking at other ways to express our disapproval of the U.N.'s actions, and to ensure that the U.N. is utilizing its budget and resources in a more effective and more equitable manner.

And I believe that our partnership is built on a foundation of shared values, including our commitment to democracy, our opposition to terrorism, and our desire to see the Palestinian people live in a safe and prosperous society.\n\nNow, regarding the role of Europe in the Middle East conflict, I believe that Europe has a vital and important role to play. Many of our European allies possess diplomatic and economic influence, which we often leverage in our joint efforts to promote peace and stability. In November of last year, when I traveled to the Middle East, I made clear that the United States wants all parties to work together, and I was pleased to see the active engagement of our European partners throughout the region.\n\nNow, I would like to emphasize that we also recognize the unique qualifications that the United States has in terms of our military capabilities and our long-standing relationship with Israel. But we believe that a viable and lasting resolution will require the active involvement and support from all parties involved, including the Arab states, the Europeans, and ourselves.

Many of the regulations in question were bogging down our economy, made us less competitive overseas, and stifled innovation.\n\nAs for my personal interests, let me be clear: as President, I've made decisions that I believe are in the best interest of this country and its people.

We've taken steps to engage in a dialogue with North Korea, in the hopes of de-escalating tensions and finding a path towards peace on the Korean Peninsula. While it's unfortunate that North Korea has rejected our proposal, we will continue to pursue diplomatic efforts with our allies in the region and explore additional options to address the ongoing concerns regarding their nuclear program.\n\nMake no mistake, the United States will not tolerate the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the region. We will work with our partners in the United Nations and other international organizations to continue applying economic and diplomatic pressure to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions.\n\nIn terms of the nonaggression treaty, we remain open to a mutual, verifiable agreement that promotes stability and security in the region. However, any such agreement must be based on the principle of denuclearization and respect for human rights and freedom.\n\nRegarding Iran, I want to say that we remain concerned about their nuclear program and the possibility of them producing a nuclear weapon. We've been working closely with our international partners, including the European Union, Russia, and China, to address our shared concerns about Iran's nuclear aspirations.\n\nThe Iranian government has agreed to cease uranium enrichment under certain conditions, and we're working to establish a nuclear watchdog agency to monitor and verify their compliance. While there have been setbacks, we remain committed to finding a peaceful, diplomatic solution to this challenge.\n\nWe will continue to pursue a two-track approach: engaging in diplomatic efforts with Iran while also maintaining the option for economic sanctions to bring pressure on the regime to abandon its nuclear ambitions.\n\nLet me be clear: the United States will not tolerate Iran developing a nuclear weapon. We believe that their nuclear program is a threat not just to Israel, but to the entire region and the world. We will continue to work with international partners to ensure that Iran is brought back into compliance with its international obligations."

Now, let me begin.\n\nWe value our relationship with Canada, and we believe that our two nations share common interests and values. And one of those shared interests is homeland security, making sure the world is safe from terrorism, particularly in the War on Terror which is one of our top priorities.\n\nRegarding Iraq, Canada has in the past participated in some military endeavors with us, so we'd like to see more of that cooperation. Specifically, in terms of diplomatic efforts, we encourage Canada to support a sovereign, stable, free Iraq through their voice at the United Nations and through bilateral engagement with the Iraqi government.\n\nNow, on the ground, we believe that Canada could provide valuable assistance. As you know, NATO has participated in efforts to help Iraq with security. We believe Canada, like many other nations, should consider contributing with personnel, in this case perhaps, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Their expertise is needed, especially in regards to institution-building in a post-conflict society. We also would appreciate seeing Canada's military may be willing to contribute more as we all work to properly train, train the Iraqis, and rebuild their nation, so that they can be able to look away from American-led forces to that of their own institutions to keep combat and training at their new  capabilities, which would further be necessary so we can begin to slowly take some of these operations off the U.S.'s plate.

We believe that violence only begets more violence, and we need to find a way to de-escalate the situation.\n\nNow, I understand that the draft proposal didn't receive the support of Lebanon, and we respect their sovereignty and their right to self-governance. But let me be clear: we will continue to press for a peaceful resolution that addresses the legitimate security concerns of both Israel and Lebanon.\n\nWe've been working with the United Nations, with the international community, to try to find a solution that's acceptable to all parties involved.

Resolution 1559, which emphasizes the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon and the extension of Lebanese sovereignty over the entire territory.\n\nNow, I think we need to be realistic about the challenges we face here. This won't be easy. But we will continue to work tirelessly to try to find a solution that's acceptable to both sides. We'll continue to engage with both the Jordanians and the Syrians to get their support for a comprehensive peace plan.

Instead, I believe that we should continue to work with international partners to strengthen the sanctions, and to support the people of Iran in their desire for freedom and democracy.\n\nThe United States will continue to keep all options on the table, including military action, but it's clearly not our first choice. I believe a diplomatic solution that respects the rights and security concerns of the people of Israel and the Middle East is still possible, and that's what we should be striving for.\n\nBut let me be clear: we will not let Iran acquire nuclear weapons, and we will work to ensure that the freedom and security of the people of Israel is protected."

We also believe that our cooperation with other nations on non-proliferation efforts to limit the spread of these weapons is crucial to national security.\n\nHowever, the situation with Russia is complex, and I would say that our relations have been somewhat strained. Russia's recent actions in certain regions have raised some questions, especially regarding their behavior towards neighbors like Ukraine and the illegal annexation of Crimea.\n\nWhile the U.S. is committed to non-proliferation and maintaining good relations, we're also mindful of Russian's actions that undermine global stability. We're looking at our aid programs carefully to ensure they align with these goals.\n\nAs for reducing aid specifically, let me be clear: we'll continue to support U.S. interests while keeping a close evaluation of our Russia program. I'm not making any immediate changes at this time, but Senator Lugar's program to secure nuclear materials, Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program, has been instrumental in consolidation of Soviet-era nuclear materials. We believe that this work should continue.\n\nWe need to balance our strategic priorities, take Russia's very serious concerns and possible implications to mind, but we can't compromise on safety when it comes to the security of the world.\n\nSo, we'll continue to consult with our experts and evaluate necessary actions, striking the balance between our bilateral relationship and our responsibility to keep the world a safer place.

We believe that this will not only bring peace and stability to the region, but also strengthen the relationship between Israel and the United States.\n\nThe timing of the U.N. resolution, I can tell you, was precipitated by several factors. First, we believe that now is the right moment for the Palestinian people to begin the process of self-governance. The elections in January of this year's presidential elections in the West Bank and Gaza have given us a legitimate and democratically elected government, which is a major step forward.\n\nSecondly, the recent Quartet meeting in London demonstrated a renewed commitment among key world leaders to move forward the peace process. And thirdly, we believe that it's essential to demonstrate international support for a Palestinian state, which will be an important step in the overall process towards peace.\n\nNow, we're not putting our faith in the United Nations; we're putting our faith in the Palestinian people to build a government that respects the rights of all its citizens and renounces violence. We're currently working closely with Prime Minister Abbas and President Arafat's successor to build a new Palestinian state that will put in place democratic institutions, promote economic development, and undermine extremist forces that seek to undermine the Middle East Peace Process.\n\nIt's a tough road ahead, no question about it.

Enriching uranium can lead to nuclear proliferation, and that's a path I don't think we should be following. We need to see real compliance from Iran. I want to see them verifiably stop all enrichment activities, that means freezing all their nuclear facilities, and allowing unfettered access to IAEA inspectors.\n\nNow, I understand the IAEA is saying that they have verified some of Iran's claims, but let me make one thing clear: our stance remains unchanged.

We're closely monitoring the situation and working closely with our allies to address this threat.\n\nRegarding the IAEA Director General's report, I agree with those who are concerned that the IAEA did not take a firmer stance on Iran's nuclear program. We believe that the IAEA should be more vigorous in its enforcement of its rules and regulations, and we're working with the international community to ensure that the IAEA takes a stronger position on this matter.\n\nNow, as for taking Iran to the Security Council, I think that's a possibility. We're not ruling it out. We're going to continue to work with the IAEA and with our allies to convince Iran to stop its nuclear program and to comply with its international obligations. We'll see how the situation develops. But let me be clear: we will not tolerate Iran acquiring nuclear weapons, and we'll take whatever steps are necessary to prevent that from happening.\n\nAnd I'd like to add, we're also working on a diplomatic effort with the Europeans and our other partners to persuade the Iranians to change their behavior. We believe that there's a path forward that doesn't involve confrontation, that involves a willingness on Iran's part to comply with the rules and regulations of the international community."

We believe that Iran's continued refusal to comply with that resolution is a key reason why further action may soon be necessary.\n\nWith respect to additional incentives, we're considering all options to address this crisis. The package offered by the European Union, while dismissed by the Iranians, remains on the table and we hope they will reconsider their position. However, if Iran continues to defy the international community, we will have to consider further measures.\n\nAs for our timeline, I want to say that we're not looking at a specific deadline. What we're focused on is the substance of their actions, not just the timing. We've made it clear that we'll work closely with our international partners to determine the next steps.

However, I also believe that any dialogue must be constructive and productive, and that Iran and Syria would need to take concrete steps to demonstrate their commitment to these goals.\n\nWe've seen Iran's aggressive behavior in the region, and I want to emphasize that we won't tolerate Iran's meddling in the internal affairs of Iraq or other countries. They need to live up to their obligations under UN Security Council resolutions and cease their support for terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas.\n\nWith respect to Syria, I think it's time for them to clarify their stance on Iraq and their relationship with extremist groups. We've seen the statements from the Syrian Foreign Ministry expressing support for the Iraqi government, and I'd like to see them follow through on those words.\n\nNow, I'm not saying we won't engage with Iran or Syria at this conference. On the contrary, we're willing to have a dialogue, but it can't be a one-way conversation. The onus is on these countries to show they're committed to peaceful coexistence and working towards a more stable region. \n\nI believe that if we can have a constructive dialogue with Iran and Syria, it will be an important step forward.

Data indicates that some Kurdish rebels in Iraq have knowledge of our operations in that country. \n\nI believe Turkey has concerns, legitimate concerns, regarding the existence of the Kurdistan Workers Party, also known as the PKK, which is both a terrorist group and an outlawed organization within Turkey. Turkey's stability and security are in our nation's interest, and we will support Turkish actions against these terrorist groups.\n\nA land incursion may not be in our best interest. I would caution the Turks that any military operation in Northern Iraq is an undertaking they should not take lightly. Turkey should consult closely with us and other members of the coalition in foreign government before making any such move. We'll support and encourage them to move forward, but we will encourage a well-planned approach and to give careful consideration to regional dynamics and potential strategic impacts and potential unintended results."

Bush, and I'll do my best to answer your question.\n\nThe issue of food prices, and the encouragement of biofuels, it's a complex issue, and the United States government has been looking at the matter closely. We've recognized the need to address the price of food, especially when it comes to the American people. With regard to biofuels, while I think our ethanol policy has been a good idea - promoting alternative energy sources - we are re-examining certain aspects of it.\n\nWe've seen how the increased demand for corn-based ethanol has led to higher food prices for certain crops. I believe it's imperative that we strike a balance between our energy policy and agriculture policy. The government is working closely with Congress to refine and re-evaluate our current policy on biofuels to ensure that our efforts to promote alternative energy sources do not come at the expense of American families and the global food supply.\n\nThis administration is committed to the principles of market-based solutions, and the solution we've been seeing to help to alleviate the high cost of food is to assist farmers. We have programs in place that will really help them expand their capacity to grow different types of corn that can be used for food as well as the other [production of ethanol] which is a step in considering to provide the utmost alleviate shortages of various food products all over the world and America alike."

We've got a history of cooperation in certain areas, such as counter-terrorism efforts, for example, and we'll continue to have dialogue with the Russians on various issues.\n\nRegarding the missile defense system, we believe it's essential to protect our citizens from ballistic missile threats from rogue states like Iran and North Korea. The United States has engaged in talks with Russia about the system, and we've been willing to share information about the system's design and capabilities. However, I must say that Russia's concerns about the system are understandable. They see it as a threat to their national security, but we believe it's essential for our own security.\n\nTo answer your question directly, the Russians are still not showing the flexibility we'd like to see on a missile defense system. They remain skeptical about the system, but we're going to continue to engage them and seek common ground. We're prepared to address their concerns and reassure them about our intentions while pursuing our own legitimate security interests.\n\nNext question, please."

In fact, just this morning, I spoke with several world leaders who share our concerns about trade and our hope to reach agreements that will maintain stability in the global marketplace.\n\nTo address the second part of your question, the tariffs are not a tax increase. They're a level playing field for our domestic industry. We're not imposing these tariffs to stimulate revenue, but to address the threat of a dying industry due to unfair trade practices. Secretary of Commerce Don Evans will work with our international partners to revisit the agreement of previous trade deals and work towards solutions."

The intelligence we've received indicates that there is a continued threat of terrorism, and we're working closely with our intelligence agencies and with our international partners to do everything in our power to mitigate that threat.\n\nThe Secretary of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge, has put out a public advisory warning Americans to be vigilant this summer, especially during peak travel periods. We urge everyone to remain aware of their surroundings, to report any suspicious activity to the authorities immediately, and to cooperate fully with law enforcement if they're contacted.\n\nWe're also taking concrete steps to enhance our defenses. We've increased surveillance and security at airports, seaports, and land borders. We're working closely with airlines and other transportation providers to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. And we're sharing intelligence with state and local law enforcement agencies so they can be prepared to respond to any potential threats.\n\nNow, I know Americans are concerned about this, and I want to reassure them that we're taking this very seriously. We've made significant progress since September 11th in strengthening our security infrastructure, and we'll continue to do everything in our power to keep America safe.\n\nBut I also want to remind Americans that their vigilance is crucial in helping us prevent terrorism. We urge everyone to be aware of their surroundings, especially at public events and during peak travel times. By working together, we can make our nation safer and more secure.\n\nWe're also reminding people that if they see something, say something. There's a great ad campaign underway that encourages people to report suspicious behavior to the authorities. It's a simple but effective way to help prevent terrorist activity.\n\nSo, to answer your question, this is a serious threat, but we're on it. We're working hard to stay ahead of these threats, and I'm confident that with our collective efforts, we can keep America safe. Thank you."

As a senior leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, he's a threat to stability and security in the region. We'll continue to pursue him and his associates, and we'll use all necessary means to disrupt and defeat his organization.\n\nBut let's be clear: Zarqawi's influence and reach is declining, and our coalition's efforts to contain him have been effective. We're having success in disrupting their networks, and the Iraqi security forces are becoming increasingly capable of dealing with the threat that he poses.\n\nWe'll continue to hunt down and capture or kill Zarqawi and his associates, and we'll support the Iraqi government in its efforts to quell the insurgency and build a stable and secure Iraq."

He reminded us of the importance of faith, compassion, and human dignity. His commitment to social justice and human rights has been an inspiration to many Americans, and his time in the Vatican will be remembered as a defining moment in the history of the Catholic Church.\n\nRegarding his opposition to the Iraq war, I respected the Pope's right to speak out on issues about which he felt strongly. I had concerns about the meaning of his words and the implications of his opposition, but I did not let them deter me from doing what I believed was necessary to protect the American people and our national security. My decision to go to war was based on a thorough analysis of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein and the intelligence upon which we relied at the time. However, I understood that the Pope's opposition was not just about the war itself, but about the manner in which we chose to achieve our objectives.\n\nI made it clear that we remained committed to upholding the principles of just war theory and protecting innocent civilians. While we had differences with the Church on this matter, I believe that our disagreements were based on good faith and not on a desire to undermine the moral authority of either the Church or the pontiff.\n\nI think it's worth noting that our administration worked closely with the State Department to brief the Vatican on the circumstances surrounding the war and to share information about our efforts to minimize civilian casualties. I've always believed that being open and transparent is essential to earning the support of the American people, and that includes showing respect and understanding for the perspectives of our allies, including the Catholic Church."

Carried interest, yeah, that's a topic that's always up for discussion.\n\nNow, I understand the perspective that some have, and I appreciate the American people's desire for fairness in the tax code.  But let me tell you, we've had some big changes to our tax system.  The Bush tax cuts in 2001 and again in 2003 lowered marginal rates across the board, but in the process, we kept the capital gains rates low.  \n\nNow, carried interest is a term that applies to private equity and hedge fund managers.  They pay rates on the investment gains of their funds, but not the actual profits they earn.  And they deduct their management fees from their income, and that's why it gets reported as a long-term capital gain, which in turn gets a lower tax rate.  That said,  in our tax law, we essentially gave that carried interest a lower rate by using that capital gains loophole.\n\nNow, as to whether it's fair, well,  I believe this needs to be considered in the broader tax landscape.  Some would argue these private equity managers earn the right to be taxed according to their flow of profits \u2013 equally to how partnerships are taxed, if you will \u2013 instead of low capital gains tax rate.  This would see the income raised but also reward productive entrepreneurship, the stimulation of businesses, and what I would say: go ahead, invest in their firms by another method. But there must be fairness in the method these are taxed. The debate remains a lively one and presidential candidate later reinforced tax plan reformed the way we do carried interest today."

I have faith in Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke to work with these institutions to make sure that any foreign investments comply with our laws and regulations.\n\nBut let's not forget, the cause of this financial crisis is not foreign investments; it's the inability of some Americans to afford homes, combined with lax lending standards and a housing market that got overheated.

These heinous acts of terrorism are a stark reminder of the challenges we face in the pursuit of peace in the Middle East.\n\nAs for the road map, we will not abandon our commitment to this two-state solution.  In fact, we believe that a renewed commitment to the road map is more important now than ever.  It's a framework for a peaceful resolution to this conflict that has held for too long.\n\nRegarding Prime Minister Abbas, I have confidence in his commitment to peace.  He was elected by the Palestinian people, and we believe he represents a new direction for the Palestinian Authority. We're seeing progress in many areas, despite these setbacks.  We're working closely with them to make sure that the Palestinian Authority is living up to its responsibilities, including preventing terrorism and disarming militias.\n\nNow, I know some of the critics have said we should somehow give up on the road map because of these latest bombings.  That's not what this president is going to do.  I'm committed to working with the international community to find a peaceful solution to this conflict, and I believe the road map gives us a good foundation for that.\n\nWe're not naive to the challenges ahead. These are tough decisions, and they're going to require tough leadership. But I have confidence that Prime Minister Abbas is committed to a different way, and we're going to continue to work with him to make progress."

The images we've seen, of American soldiers mistreating Iraqi detainees, are deeply disturbing and they don't represent the values we stand for, or the values of the vast majority of the brave men and women who serve our country. We will of course hold accountable those who broke the law and bring them to justice.\n\nThese abuses are unacceptable, and I've taken immediate action, I've ordered an investigation into this matter and I've also asked General Taguba to look into the allegations of these abuses. The abuse of prisoners in Abu Ghraib in Baghdad is a stain on our military, and as the Commander-in-Chief, I'm deeply troubled by it.\n\nNow, as for winning the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people, I want to assure the American people that our commitment to freedom and democracy remains steadfast and unwavering. The actions of a few will in no way define the incredible progress we've made in Iraq, and the sacrifice that's been made by our troops.\n\nOur strategy going forward remains the same. We're committed to rebuilding, to improving security and to engaging in a dialogue with the Iraqi people, with the Iraqis themselves. We will complete the missions we've undertaken, and we will make sure that those responsible for these abuses are punished, but we will continue with the difficult work that lies ahead.\""

The relationship between the United States and Great Britain is a strong one, and we value the trust and the commitment that the British people have shown in our shared goals.\n\nAs for any sense of obligation, I believe that the bond between our two nations is more than a transactional one. Our alliance is built on shared values, a sense of common purpose, and a commitment to the defense and promotion of freedom and democracy. While we do engage in discussions on specific matters of mutual interest and shared security concerns, our partnership is more a product of a deep-seated friendship and a shared sense of what is right, rather than simply a quid pro quo.\n\nHowever, I do want to highlight that the commitment of British troops in Iraq is a testament to the unwavering commitment of the Blair administration to our shared goals. The bravery and sacrifice of these fine soldiers will not be forgotten by the United States."

However, engaging in direct talks with countries that have a history of supporting terrorism, such as Iran, presents a significant challenge.\n\nWhile I recognize that some of our allies have suggested that talks could potentially yield progress, I must caution that such talks would require a clear understanding of what we want to achieve. The United States has certain non-negotiables when it comes to our security, including not allowing Iran to develop nuclear weapons capabilities and not providing support to extremist groups in Iraq.\n\nAs it stands, I believe that Iraq's neighbors must understand that their influence in Iraq is declining and that their systematic support for insurgency is a major hindrance to the stability of the country. I have made it clear that we will not negotiate with terrorist organizations."

But I do have concerns about some of the directions he's indicated he'd like to take the country. \n\nOne of the biggest concerns I have is regarding the war on terror. I've made the case, and I believe the American people agree, that we should be taking the fight to the enemy. We've made progress in Iraq, we've got a new government up and running, and we've begun withdrawing our troops. \n\nI'm concerned that Senator Obama might prematurely withdraw our forces from Iraq, and I'm concerned that might give al-Qaeda the opportunity to reconstitute and launch another attack. We can't afford that risk to the American people.\n\nAnother area of concern for me is Guantanamo Bay and the treatment of detainees. I've made it clear that we need to make sure we're treating these individuals humanely, but we also have to make sure we're not putting the American people at risk. I'm not convinced that Senator Obama's plan to close Guantanamo Bay is the right course of action.\n\nAnd finally, I'm concerned about the potential impact on the economy of some of the policies he's talked about implementing in the first 100 days. I believe it's the wrong time to be proposing significant new taxes and expanding government spending. The first priority of any administration should be to strengthen the economy, and I'm not convinced that his approach will do that.\n\nThese are just a few of the concerns I have, but I respect Senator Obama's record and his desire to bring people together to get things done."

You're right, during my campaign I did pledge to address the situation in the Balkans, and I continue to believe that increased self-reliance and stability are key objectives for that region.\n\nWhile true, my administration has increased our military presence in the region, particularly in Kosovo, with the deployment of our KFOR forces to maintain the peace and support the democratic government. However, that doesn't change the ultimate goal. My administration has made commitments to work toward a more stable and self-sufficient Kosovo, and that includes scaling back our military presence over time.\n\nIn fact, I'm pleased to report that, with the situation stabilizing, NATO, along with our international partners, is already beginning to transfer responsibilities to the Kosovo Stability Force. This is exactly what we envisioned when we deployed in the first place: to bring peace and stability, and then to let the Kosovars take responsibility for their own future. So, we're on track to achieve that goal, and the American people know that we will continue to work toward that end, even in the face of new challenges or changing circumstances."

The ABM Treaty has been a subject of interest for us for some time, and we've indeed had extensive discussions on its implications and its future. Our administration believes that the treaty, while well-intentioned, is a relic of the Cold War and is in need of reform.\n\nRegarding progress, we're closely reviewing the treaty and the implications of our potential withdrawal. I'd say we're making good headway in assessing our options, but I must stress that we're taking a very thorough approach to this.\n\nWe've been conveying to our allies and partners around the world that our intention all along has been to address the concerns and irritants in the ABM Treaty, rather than to unilaterally step away from it. However, the reality is that this treaty does hinder our national security interests by preventing us from developing an effective missile defense system. We must have the capacity to defend ourselves against the growing threat of ballistic missile attacks.\n\nYou know, there are a lot of factors influencing our decision-making process. We're working closely with Russia to find a mutually beneficial solution that allows both sides to have a stronger defense capability. So I'm optimistic that we'll have a breakthrough that will work for all parties involved.\n\nHave I been convinced there won't be any withdrawal? (smiling) Well, that's the kind of question that's hard to predict accurately. What I can tell you is that every option is on the table, and we're going to make our decision based on what's best for America's national security interests.

Now, an income test is an interesting concept. While it may not be an absolute requirement, it could be worth looking at as one of the many tools we can use to strengthen the program and preserve our promise to retirees and future generations.\n\nAs you know, we have proposed a plan that includes a partial privatization component, which has many benefits, including allowing individuals a greater say in their retirement portfolios and a possible return on investment. However, I'm also committed to protecting the program for low- and middle-income Americans.\n\nIf an income test was part of a larger package that strengthens Social Security while ensuring its long-term solvency, then I'd be willing to listen to the idea. It's not something I've ruled out entirely, but I have not made any final decisions on this issue yet. I'll consider any constructive proposals as part of our ongoing effort to preserve Social Security for generations to come.\n\nIt's time for bipartisan efforts from both parties to provide our fellow Americans with a brighter future, and I remain committed to engaging in those discussions."

As you know, the recent election in Palestine has sparked a lot of discussion and concern among world leaders.  While I've stated before that Hamas's victory is a result of an electoral process, this also raises a lot of questions about their stance on terrorism.\n\nLet me be clear: we have consistently made it known to the Palestinian people that we will not deal with organizations that support terrorism.  The United States has a policy in place to isolate Hamas and promote a more moderate leadership.\n\nNow, it's a bit of a tricky situation. I firmly believe in the democratic process, and we respect the Palestinian people's right to choose their leaders. However, we also must ensure that we're supporting a Palestinian government that shares our values and is committed to the principles of peace.\n\nIn terms of direct dealings with a Hamas-led government, at least initially, I would have to rule out official engagement. We cannot have, as one of our partners in the peace process, an organization that has advocated for violence, supported terrorism, and worked against the interests of the Israeli people.\n\nBut I've also made it clear that we're open to talking with Hamas if there's a willingness to renounce violence, recognize Israel's right to exist, and abide by the Quartet's principles. I've said this time and time again: our policy of supporting the Palestinian people and advancing peace is not static; it can evolve over time, and we can reevaluate our stance as circumstances change."

It's a group that doesn't share our values of freedom and democracy.\n\nNow, I'm not saying we're going to shut off all funding. We've got an obligation to the Palestinian people, and we want to make sure that those suffering in Gaza and in the West Bank get the humanitarian aid that they need.\n\nHowever, we cannot have official ties with an organization like Hamas. We need to be able to work with a Palestinian government that shares our values and our goals for peace.\n\nWe'll have to see how this shakes out.

I've said before, I take full responsibility for the decisions I made as the Commander-in-Chief during my time in office. You know, as a leader, it's not always easy to sit back and think about what you could've done differently.\n\nThere were a number of decisions made by my administration in Iraq that didn't quite turn out as planned. One of the biggest regrets I have is the lack of planning and resources provided for the post-Saddam Hussein phase of the conflict. I wish we'd had a more robust plan in place for rebuilding Iraq and stabilizing the country in the aftermath of the regime collapse.\n\nAdditionally, I regret not doing more to anticipate and prepare for the sectarian violence that erupted in Iraq. We did anticipate some level of sectarian conflict, but I don't think we fully appreciated its scope and intensity.\n\nAnother area for improvement would've been to have begun planning for a phased drawdown of U.S. troops earlier. While I understand the need for security, I wish we'd worked harder on building up the Iraqi Security Forces so that we could hand over responsibilities to them sooner rather than later. (pausing) This delay in transfer of power ultimately contributed to the duration and the challenge of the conflict.\n\nNow, I want to make one thing clear: the intelligence leading up to the decision to go into Iraq was of varying quality, but we had reason to believe Saddam Hussein's regime did possess sizeable volumes of weapons of mass destruction. In the end, we did not find such weapons present in Iraq. I acknowledge that was a major miscalculation on our part.\n\nI wish we'd communicated our visions and intentions more clearly to the Iraqis and the American people. Transparency, I believe, would have helped."

Ann Richards was a remarkable individual, and I had the pleasure of debating her back in 1994 when I was running for governor of Texas. Now, in 1994, I was the challenger, and Ann Richards was the incumbent governor. We had our differences, as you might expect, but I always respected her tenacity, her passion for public service, and her unwavering commitment to the people of Texas.\n\nI'll never forget the 1990 gubernatorial debate when Ann Richards famously made that comment at the Al Smith Dinner, saying I was \"ashamed\" to call myself a Texan. (chuckles) Well, I guess that was a hill to die on, and it kind of stuck in the mind. (laughter) Nonetheless, though we were opponents, I thought she was a strong, capable leader, and I admired the role she played in Texas politics.\n\nAs I look back, I think that election taught me a lot about campaign strategy, about public finance, and about the importance of grassroots support. I was fortunate to have a great team, and we ran a campaign that was centered around reform and bringing change to our great state. Ann Richards was a worthy opponent, and I appreciate the lessons I learned from her and that campaign.\n\nOn a personal note, I think it's fair to say that her passion and spirit are still qualities I admire.

But we must remember that sanctions are just one tool in our toolbox, and we're working with our international partners to impose the strongest possible sanctions on North Korea.\n\nWe're also looking at other options, including military readiness and capabilities to deter North Korea's aggression.

This administration has a comprehensive energy policy that balances the need to increase production with the need to reduce our reliance on foreign oil.\n\nI've made it clear that I'm committed to increasing drilling for oil and natural gas in America, not withstanding these energy seminars proposing a halt to fuel, gas and coal for example production.

In my conversations with President Musharraf, I've made it clear that we support education as a means to promote understanding and peace.

I think there's a need to balance the preservation of a rich cultural heritage while also fostering an environment where tolerance, moderation, and a commitment to democracy can flourish.\n\nThis is not a one-size-fits-all proposition. What works for the United States may not necessarily work for Pakistan. What we can do is support and encourage efforts that broaden access to quality education, speech, and peace, while at the same time respecting the rights of the people of Pakistan to pursue their own path.\n\nNow, in our daily view there is more of a need to jeopardize just Al Qaida in that region but also deal with GENERAL pressures that breeds anger and resentment when maintaining pretty much boast over shortages of food,water, housing.

I made those decisions based on the best intelligence available to me at the time, and I had a moral obligation to act in the face of threats to our nation's security.\n\nNow, did I have high hopes that Saddam Hussein would follow through on his promises? Of course, I did. We believed that he was allowing al-Qaeda safe haven in the country, and we were determined to eliminate that threat. But, I also made it clear that we would be looking to find and disarm Saddam's WMDs once we got into the country. \n\nNow, regarding the WMD, I regret that we didn't have the progress we'd hoped for in finding them. But, we also know that Saddam's regime didn't cooperate fully with the international community, and that made it a difficult task.\n\nAs for presenting that information to the public, I did not intentionally try to mislead anyone about what we knew about WMDs. The intelligence assessments at the time were based on the information we had available. I consistently made it clear that we were going into Iraq to root out the threat of WMDs, as well as to deal with the Saddam Hussein regime. I think we've been successful in removing Saddam Hussein from power, and that's a major accomplishment.\n\nBut, it's also clear that the intelligence community got some of the projections wrong, and we need to learn from those mistakes in order to better assess the situation in the future. That's why we've taken steps to reform our intelligence processes, to try to make sure that we have the best possible information available to us.\n\nSo, in a word, I don't think we were misled, I think we made a decision based on the best information available."

While there are \u2013 there are differing opinions and views within the region, I am optimistic that we can work together to achieve a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nAs for reaching beyond Yasser Arafat, I believe it's necessary to find other leaders who can carry on the cause of peace. As you know, Yasser Arafat made some bold decisions recently that had consequences. And so, we're looking at other leaders in the Palestinian Authority who may be more willing and able to engage with the Israeli government in a meaningful way.\n\nAnd I must say, I'm encouraged by the meeting I had with King Abdullah of Jordan last week. He believes that peace is possible, and he's willing to work with us to achieve that goal. And, of course, we're also working closely with other leaders in the region, like Egyptian President Mubarak and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah.\n\nSo, I'm confident that we can find common ground and work together to create a more stable and secure Middle East. The key is for all parties to be willing to make the tough choices necessary to achieve peace."

Let me tell you, we have gathered a significant amount of intelligence and evidence regarding Iraq's development and possession of weapons of mass destruction, and that's why we've gone to the United Nations, as you know, to try to get the world to take seriously the threat that Saddam Hussein poses.\n\nNow, I understand there may be some critics out there who are calling for absolute, 100% proof, but let me tell you, such a standard is unrealistic. It's like asking the FBI to prove the identity of the 9/11 hijackers beyond a reasonable doubt after they'd already passed through airport security and hijacked their planes. Sometimes, leaders have to make decisions based on the very best intelligence available to them, and not necessarily wait until every last shred of doubt is completely eliminated.\n\nClearly, the intelligence is persuasive that Saddam Hussein has attempted to acquire nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, and that's why we're taking the prudent course of action by focusing our efforts on disarmament in Iraq."

Our goal remains to transfer lead responsibility to the Iraqi military and the Iraqi government as quickly as possible.\n\nAs for getting more foreign troops involved, we're pleased that many of our coalition partners have committed to staying on in Iraq to help us support the new government and train the Iraqi security forces. We'll continue to work with those partners to ensure we have a stable and secure environment in Iraq, but the idea that we're looking for a quick withdrawal without a solid foundation for stability is not on the table.\n\nWe'll continue to make decisions that keepAmericans safe and ensure the success of the mission in Iraq."

What I was trying to do in my inaugural address was to make clear that the United States of America will not be driven by a policy of appeasement. \n\nAs I said, we will not be deterred by shrill voices that seek to discourage us from confronting the dangers that face our world. We will stand firm against the forces of tyranny, extremism, and terrorism. However, this does not mean we are looking for confrontation with other nations. In fact, I believe diplomacy is an essential tool in our efforts to promote peace and security.\n\nWhen it comes to Iran, let me be clear: our policy is to encourage Iran's transition to democracy, and to prevent them from acquiring a nuclear capability. But we will achieve this goal through diplomacy, through engagement, and through the use of sanctions if necessary.\n\nSo, let's not mischaracterize our intent. We are committed to a policy of multilateral engagement, and we will work with our international partners to address the problems that face the world. Thank you."

We need to make it clear to Iran that the world is united in our resolve to address the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n\nAs I said in my recent speech to the United Nations, we must have a unified international response to this threat. The Iranian regime's pursuit of nuclear technology is a threat to peace and security. We will not engage in separate talks or one-on-one negotiations with Iran without a shared commitment to press Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions.\n\nWe've been working closely with the Europeans, and we appreciate their efforts to achieve a lasting solution to this crisis. We'll continue to support their diplomacy, and we'll keep all options on the table to address the Iranian nuclear program.

With regards to FEMA's readiness for the upcoming season, I am confident in the men and women who work tirelessly at the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

We conduct regular drills, training exercises, and tabletop simulations to ensure that they're better equipped to handle emergency situations. Additionally, we conduct annual reviews of their preparedness, looking at their equipment, their personnel, and their strategies.\n\nOne of the most pressing issues in recent years has been the rebuilding efforts throughout the Gulf Coast following Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita.  We've made significant strides in getting resources in the hands of these fine Americans who were so severely impacted, and I'm proud of the progress we've made.\n\nIn the aftermath of those disasters, we also implemented several reforms within the agency, aimed at reducing bureaucratic red tape and expediting the delivery of aid to those in need.  These changes have allowed FEMA to respond more quickly and effectively in the face of emergencies.\n\nWhile there's certainly more work to be done, I'm optimistic about the progress we've made.

We've made it clear that this is a crucial mission in the war on terror and we will have international support. In fact, we have coalition partners from 35 countries contributing troops, intelligence and resources to this effort.\n\nThat being said, there may be some countries that are rethinking their commitments or evaluating their level of participation. But I've spoken with the leaders of several key countries, and they're committed to our cause. Make no mistake, the coalition is still united in our determination to defeat terrorism and bring stability to the region.\n\nWe've worked hard to make sure that our coalition partners know that the fight against terrorism is a global effort, and that we're committed to protecting them from the scourge of terror as much as we are protecting ourselves. And I believe that we'll continue to attract support from nations around the world that share our values of freedom and human rights.\n\nNow, I do want to add that there have been some countries that have expressed hesitation or concerns about escalating their commitment in Iraq. But every country in the world has its own strategic interests and security concerns, and it's not surprising that they'd be cautious in this environment.\n\nHowever, I'm confident that we'll continue to build on the progress we're making, both in Iraq and in our global efforts against terrorism.

We do support, however, certain conditions before those prisoners would be released, such as that the individuals released not engage in terrorist activities against Israel. We also understand the compelling humanitarian cases for some of the prisoners to be released.\n\nWhat I urge both the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to focus on is to move forward on the key steps outlined in the roadmap for peace, which include the establishment of a Palestinian state, the dismantling of terrorist organizations, and the implementation of international human rights.

We value our relationship with Russia, and we'll be looking at areas where we can work together on this pressing issue and many others."

This summit is an opportunity for us to work together on achieving the goals outlined in Agenda 21, as well as to address pressing issues such as sustainable development, poverty, and environmental protection.\n\nAs the President of the United States, my administration's aim in Johannesburg is to lead by example and demonstrate America's commitment to sustainable development and environmental protection. I'm proud to say that we've made significant progress in recent years in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, increasing our use of renewable energy sources, and taking steps to protect our precious natural resources.\n\nOf course, there are many challenges ahead, particularly in terms of access to energy and reducing poverty worldwide. Those poverty rates, folks, they deafen us, they're unacceptable. It's my position, as well as the position of many nations, that the developed world has a role to play in addressing those challenges.\n\nIn Johannesburg, I'll be seeking commitments from other nations to work together on clean water and sanitation, education, and health initiatives. We'll be exploring new partnerships among governments, private sector, and non-profit organizations to leverage our collective resources and expertise to meet these global challenges.\n\nOne of the key areas of focus for us will be mobilizing action on a new sustainable development partnership, a program that brings together governments, international organizations, and the private sector to focus on supporting sustainable development in the developing world.\n\nNow, it's essential we recognize that the Summit's success will be measured by the concrete steps that nations agree to take and the actual results they achieve. And that's my number one aim, to ensure that this Summit truly produces tangible, lasting benefits for the men and women and children of the developing world.\n\nAnd I believe that here in the United States, we have a role to play in this. We've made great progress in our own country to address our environmental priorities, and we're committed to continuing our efforts to address the global challenges we face together.\n\nThanks, and now I'm happy to take your questions."

Let me be clear: the United States of America has a strong commitment to the United Nations and its role in promoting international peace and security.\n\nHowever, when it comes to a new United Nations resolution about Iraq, I must say that it's essential that any such resolution must comply with the letter and the spirit of UN Security Council Resolution 1441, which clearly sets out the parameters for Iraqi compliance with disarmament, and the consequences for failure to comply.\n\nWe will closely examine any new proposal that comes before the Security Council to ensure it is consistent with the international community's commitment to enforcing the UN resolutions regarding Iraq. Any resolution must include clear and enforceable provisions for disarmament, accountability, and consequences for non-compliance.\n\nAdditionally, we will also look to see if it strengthens the authority of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the United Nations Monitoring and Verification Commission (UNMOVIC) to carry out their critical work in Iraq.\n\nUltimately, our primary concern is the safety and security of the American people, and we will only support a resolution that helps achieve that goal while also upholding our commitment to the international community and the United Nations Charter. Thank you."

We believe this plan has some merit in that it could help reduce violence and bring a sense of hope to both Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nI support the idea of Israel pulling out of Gaza and four settlements in the West Bank. It's a significant compromise, but it's a necessary step to create an atmosphere for further negotiations. We're calling on both sides to work hard to achieve this goal.\n\nBut I do have concerns about the plan, particularly with regards to its potential impact on Israeli settlers and how the Palestinians might respond. The goal here is not to just pull out of Gaza and the West Bank, but to create conditions for a sustainable peace. We will be working closely with both the Israelis and Palestinians to make sure that happens.\n\nLaura, would you like to add anything to that?"

First, I want to say that Medicare is an important part of our Nation's healthcare system and we're working hard to make sure that our seniors receive the care they need. However, our focus on Social Security at this time was driven by the fact that the trustees of the Social Security trust fund have informed us that the system will begin to run out of money in 2042, which means that the social security surplus we've built up over the years will be depleted by 2042 and that's when payments will start to decline.\n\nWe took action early and proposed private accounts, allowing younger workers to divert a portion of their payroll taxes to a personal investment account, in which the Government would presumably match and contribute towards.  This would help put more money into the system so that it will be viable for our seniors when they need it.\n\nIt's worth noting that Social Security's trust fund will be drained in short order,  which is why, we believe it's vital to start taking action now, by giving workers a choice to put some of their money into a personal account.  On the other hand, Medicare, is facing a financial crisis due to demographic changes, and while it's a bigger problem, the predicted shortfall for Medicare, doesn't occur for a quite a bit longer.\n\nMoreover, we also believe private savings and personal initiative can be a panacea for a whole level of problems that occur in terms of funding the programs, we at least wish to maintain a relatively open system. Though many disagree with our beliefs, the gravity of the social security situation as of late was our believing to be a pressing matter."

I've made it very clear that the proliferation of these kinds of weapons is unacceptable. And as you know, we've been working diligently to address this issue, particularly with regards to nations such as North Korea, Iran, and Iraq.\n\nWe've been in talks with our international partners, including the United Nations, to impose tougher sanctions and to push for non-proliferation efforts. I've also stated publicly my commitment to diplomatic solutions and to working with other nations to prevent these countries from developing nuclear and missile capabilities.\n\nThe results of these talks have been mixed. While we've made some progress in certain areas, the primary challenge remains in getting nations like North Korea and Iran to abandon their nuclear ambitions. Their past actions, such as North Korea's missile tests and Iran's continued uranium enrichment, demonstrate that these are significant threats to regional and global security."

I, of course, appreciate all the hard work that the Republican Party has done in the great state of Texas and across this nation.  Now, I know that there are many differing opinions on the war in Iraq. I was elected to make the tough decisions, and in this case, the decision was to secure the spread of weapons of mass destruction and help bring democracy to a part of the world that desperately needed it.\n\nI still believe that taking out Saddam Hussein's regime was the right decision.  While the situation in Iraq is indeed challenging, I also firmly believe that it's in the national security and strategic interests of the United States of America. \n\nHowever, I do agree that the situation on the ground is difficult, and we must continue to work with the Iraqi government, the Al-Maliki government, to get their security forces up and on their feet, so that we can transition to those Iraqi forces securing the country, and that's the direction we're headed.  I also want to remind the American people of the sacrifices made in this war, the sacrifice that has been asked of our brave men and women in uniform and the families that back them.

The recent deployment of additional troops to Iraq has helped to secure the capital, reduce sectarian violence, and enhance the ability of the Iraqi forces to maintain security.\n\nWe will continue to work closely with the Iraqi government to evaluate their requests for military support.

The reason for this is because our relationship with the United Kingdom, with our alliance through NATO, and our relationship with the countries that said no to Saddam Hussein's aggression in Iraq - Poland, Spain, Italy, and others - all of these play a significant role in securing freedom and stability in the world.\n\nHowever, I believe that our special relationship with the United Kingdom does have a unique place in history and in the world today. It's a relationship based on shared values, long-standing friendship, and our experiences together in two world wars.

But I will say this: I've been clear, I've been consistent in my commitment to conduct myself personally and professionally at the highest level. My supporters may have differing opinions, and I respect that. I've always called for a respectful campaign, and my campaign will continue to stay focused on issues that matter to the American people: national security, the economy, and education.\n\nAs for Mr. Kerry's record, I think the American people will be given ample opportunity to make their own decisions by considering the facts. And I believe firmly in the ability of Americans to make their own judgments about the candidates."

    "gen_response": "I believe the coming election is a time for the American people to assess our progress, our successes, and our challenges here at home and abroad. While Iraq is an important issue, I think it's unfair to say that it's a referendum on Iraq alone. \n\nWe're at war, and the decision to go to war was a difficult one. And it was made with the best interests of the American people in mind. The terrorist threat is sweeping the world, and Iraq is a key location in that fight.\n\nThe real question before the American people is, have we made progress in the war on terror? Have we strengthened our security at home? Have we moved the ball forward on the issues that matter most to them - education, healthcare, and the economy? I believe we've done just that.\n\nOf course, the war is not without its difficulties, and we've made our share of mistakes. But it's not about avoiding tough decisions; it's about making the right decisions, and then owning up to the consequences of those decisions."

    "gen_response": "Good afternoon, thank you for your question. The damage from Hurricane Katrina has been extensive and devastating. The Gulf Coast, particularly New Orleans and the surrounding areas, has been drastically affected. Many homes have been destroyed, businesses have been damaged or destroyed, and thousands of people are in need of assistance.\n\nThe full extent of the damage is still being assessed, but early reports indicate that it could be one of the costliest natural disasters in our nation's history. The hurricane has caused widespread flooding, power outages, and a significant disruption to critical infrastructure.\n\nWe have mobilized the federal government's resources to respond to this disaster, and all available assets are being utilized to assist in the relief efforts. I've declared the affected areas as disaster zones, which provides access to federal assistance and resources.\n\nWe're working closely with the state and local authorities, as well as international partners, to provide aid, shelter, and support to those affected by the hurricane. We'll continue to work tirelessly to address the immediate needs of those impacted and to rebuild and restore the affected communities.\n\nI've spoken to the governors of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, and I assure you that we're committed to doing everything in our power to assist them in this time of need. We'll get through this, Americans are resilient, and we'll overcome this adversity together. Thank you."

    "gen_response": "Thank you for that question.  The death penalty is a serious matter that has been a part of our justice system for a long time, and it's an issue that I believe is essential to maintain the integrity of our society. The reason we have the death penalty is not just for retribution, but to protect the American people. When premeditated murder takes place, the death penalty ensures that those who commit such heinous acts will face the ultimate penalty, and it's a strong deterrent.\n\nIn our administration, we believe in giving individuals those who commit such heinous crimes the opportunity to pay the price for their crimes, rather than putting victims' families through lengthy trials."

    "gen_response": "That's a question that gets to the heart of the nature of progress, my fellow Americans. (chuckles) When we set out to achieve a goal, whether it's America's strategic objectives, for instance, in Iraq and Afghanistan, or the goals set forth in our domestic initiatives like the No Child Left Behind Act, we understand that sometimes progress may take time.\n\nThe key is to be patient, persistent, and stay the course. There isn't necessarily a time limit on achieving our goals. What's most important is to make steady progress, measure our success, and adjust our strategies as needed.\n\nTake, for example, the recovery efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. There was a perception that the progress was slow, but we got the job done. We rebuilt, we rejuvenated, and we helped the people affected by that tragedy to rebuild their lives. It took time, but the time was worth it.\n\nSo to answer your question, there isn't a time limit per se, but there's an expectation that we'll make progress, and we'll make it our priority. Thank you."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you. I appreciate the opportunity to address this question. Germany, a valued ally and friend, has a long history of standing alongside the United States in times of great challenge. However, regarding a potential war in Iraq, I've spoken with Chancellor Schr\u00f6der, and I understand that they've made it clear they will not be participating.\n\nGermany's decision reflects their position, and we respect that. Clearly, there's no consensus across Europe on this matter. Nonetheless, our discussion with Germany is ongoing. We're continuing to consult with them, as we are with other nations in the international community, regarding the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, a threat to global security and to peace.\n\nThe United States will continue to stand strong in our resolve to disarm Iraq of these WMDs. Our coalition is diverse, and our friends are each contributing in various ways. Germany, though not a military participant, is engaged in humanitarian efforts and in diplomatic undertakings that will aid the Iraqi people and support a free and stable Iraq. We value their commitment to those goals, and we will continue to work with them towards a unified international resolve."

    "gen_response": "Good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate the chance to address your questions today. I am pleased with the progress we've made in this recovery effort, and I am proud of the men and women who've been working tirelessly to help the good people of New Orleans, and the Gulf Coast.\n\nNow, no one anticipated the sheer magnitude of Katrina, and I don't think any government could've been fully prepared for it. But we've mobilized the largest rescue and relief effort in American history, and I think it's been effective.\n\nThat being said, I understand the frustration and anger that so many people have about the performance of our response. Frankly, I'm frustrated too. We're working diligently to improve operations, streamline the delivery of aid, and increase transparency in the process.\n\nOne area for improvement I'm particularly focused on is the absence of clear, timely communication at the federal level. I've ordered General McConnell, our FEMA Administrator, to take a fresh look at our emergency preparedness and response plans, to make sure we're better equipped to respond to future disasters.\n\nI've also established the \"President's Katrina Recovery Task Force\" to help coordinate, oversee, and make sure we're doing everything in our power to rebuild the Gulf Coast in a way that makes it stronger and more resilient than before. I intend to personally oversee this effort, to make sure we learn from our mistakes and do better next time.\n\nIn that regard, this recovery effort is an improvement over previous disasters, and we're moving forward with constructive reforms and changes to prevent such a disaster from happening again. So while I share the American people's frustrations, I firmly believe our progress ultimately will justify their trust in the government and her people."

    "gen_response": "The reporter is referring to the recent body count in Iraq, I presume.\n\nWell, let me tell you, progress is not just about a body count.  Progress is about overthrowing a brutal dictator who harbored and sponsored terrorism, putting in place a democratically elected government, and building a stable and secure nation in the Middle East.\n\nNow, I know those numbers can be difficult to bear, and I feel deeply for the families of those who have lost loved ones in the conflict.  And I want to assure the American people that we're doing everything in our power to reduce the violence and the attacks in Iraq.\n\nThe nature of war is such that there will be violence, there will be casualties. But we cannot measure progress solely by body count. What we need to look at is the bigger picture: are more Iraqis living in freedom? Are they building an economy that's an engine for growth? Are they moving towards a stable and functioning democracy?\n\nAnd the answer to all of those questions is yes. The Iraqis are making significant progress in many areas, and that is what will ultimately determine the success of our efforts in that country.\n\nNow, I know that these difficulties are a constant reminder of the war's human cost. But we must keep in mind that we're fighting a war against a ruthless enemy who does not discriminate between civilians and combatants. They are a brutal and unsavory enemy. And it's one that requires a strong and resolute response from the United States."

    "gen_response": "(pausing for a moment, taking a deep breath) Ah, the events of September 11th, 2001. A dark day in our nation's history, one that shook the very foundations of our country. As the President of the United States at the time, I certainly felt a deep sense of personal responsibility to act quickly and decisively to protect the American people.\n\nLook, I made the decisions I thought were necessary to ensure the safety of the nation, and the things I did, I did with the advice of my national security team and the best intelligence we had at the time. Now, you know, hindsight is always 20/20, but I've always tried to be a leader who takes responsibility for the consequences of the actions I've taken.\n\nI believe my focus was on addressing the immediate threat and doing everything I could to prevent more attacks from occurring. The decision to go to war in Afghanistan and to authorize the use of force against those who had attacked us were difficult, grave decisions, but I believed they were necessary to protect our nation and our people.\n\nOf course, the outcome of those actions, the consequences of the war in Iraq, are still debated today. I understand that the American people are still grappling with the impact of those decisions. (pausing) I take full responsibility for those consequences, but I also recognize that I was not alone in making those decisions. I had the advice of my team, and ultimately, they were my decisions to make.\n\nI know the burden of that responsibility weighs heavily on me, but I've always tried to approach it with a commitment to doing what I thought was right for the country, even when it was difficult or unpopular. (looking directly at the press corps) That's what I did as President, and I stand by those decisions."

    "gen_response": "Thank you, thank you. Good question. \n\nFirst and foremost, I want to emphasize that the world has already responded to Iran's destabilizing actions. We've imposed tough economic sanctions, including freezing the assets of individuals and organizations linked to Iran's nuclear and missile programs. This means cutting off the funding for their illicit activities. We've also worked closely with our allies to enhance international pressure on Iran to comply with UN Security Council resolutions and dismantle its nuclear program.\n\nFurthermore, we will continue to support the Iranian people's aspirations for freedom, but we will do so in ways that promote peace and stability in the region. If diplomatic avenues fail and the international community loses trust in Iran's intentions, we'll work with our international partners to intensify economic sanctions and supporting measures. The goal is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, by any means necessary.\n\nOur diplomatic efforts, led by my Secretary of State, Colin Powell, will continue to seek a negotiated resolution to the nuclear issue. Whether through renewed multilateral talks or strengthening the diplomatic efforts of the International Atomic Energy Agency, our commitment remains to prevent the spread of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons.\n\nNow, I want to make one thing clear \u2013 we do not want a war with Iran. We do, however, remain firm in our commitment to protect our allies and prevent a destabilizing force from threatening peace and security in the region. If push comes to shove, we'll not hesitate to defend our interests.\n\nOur goal is two-fold: First, stop the development of weapons of mass destruction in Iran, and second, support the aspirations of the Iranian people for a more democratic and peaceful future."

    "gen_response": "Good afternoon, thank you for asking. The United States of America has long been concerned about Iran's nuclear program, and I firmly believe that Iran's intentions have not been entirely truthful or transparent. We have evidence that suggests they are pursuing nuclear capabilities, and as a result, I believe we have every reason to be concerned about the intentions of the Iranian regime.\n\nNow, I know some critics have said that the concerns about Iran's nuclear program are overblown, and that the Iranian president has said that their intentions are peaceful. But let me be clear: we cannot take the Iranian government at its word. We must rely on verifiable evidence, and the evidence we have is troubling.\n\nThe Iranian nuclear program has been investigated by the IAEA, and they have found evidence of nuclear activities that are not consistent with a peaceful program. Iran has refused to cooperate with the IAEA, refused to provide access to suspected nuclear sites, and has failed to provide a clear and credible explanation for their activities.\n\nSo, in light of all this, I firmly believe that Iran is pursuing nuclear capabilities, and it's our responsibility as a nation, in concert with our allies and partners, to address this threat, to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, and to ensure that they do not pose a danger to the stability of the Middle East."
